The fun thing is that you pay for those cards with life instead of mana, hence why that lifelink keyword is handy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up in Spidey’s baddies, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l23MO?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Norman Osborn/Green Goblin</u></a> is a 1/1 that can’t be blocked, triggering Connive and giving him the potential to climb in power. Pay the mana cost, and he turns into Green Goblin, able to cheapen spells from the graveyard that you discarded through Connive. He’s $15 now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QdpbNZ?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Anti-Venom, Horrifying Healer</u></a> we’ve already touched on, and he’s now $12 or so. I’m personally planning to pick him up once we get to around the $10 mark I think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, the meme-worthy <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBDglJ?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Imposter Syndrome</u></a> has levelled out at around $10. It lets you create a non-legendary copy of a creature that attacked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, if you wanted to build a five-color Spider-Verse deck, <u>Cosmic Spider-Man</u> is just $10 now. He’s got a ton of keywords that he transfers to other Spider Hero characters, and makes an ideal Commander for anyone looking to drop a ton of them into the same deck</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Climbers This Week</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/crashers-and-climbers-template-2-1760711178228.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Number one on our climbers this week is <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRMn51?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mortuary</u></a>, a card that’s 27 years old and basically bounces creatures from your graveyard straight to the top of your library.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s simple enough, and it’s been a few dollars at most. Now, TCGPlayer has it climbing to around $30 thanks to the emergence of Gwenom, Remorseless, which can pay life to cast cards from the top of your library.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, when is a Turtle Ninja not a Ninja Turtle? When it’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwKJn?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Taeko, the Patient Avalanche</u></a>, of course. Nothing to do with the upcoming TMNT set, this card enters tapped and powers up as cards leave the battlefield without dying. It’s reached $15, having been around $5 just a week or two ago. Turtle power, indeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aADgqo?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Attunement</u></a> came out in 1998 and works very nicely for turning Norman Osborn into Green Goblin and causing chaos. Did the designers in 1998 ever anticipate that sentence? It’s unlikely, but the card is up to $11 right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a013g5?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Goryo’s Vengeance</u></a> is a nice bit of graveyard recursion that gets you flinging a big nasty from the graveyard back for one last hurrah, all for just two mana. It’s up to $15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/av34rx?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Entangler</u></a> is a very fun one. It pairs with Anti-Venom, Horrifying Healer (more from him shortly), allowing him to block multiple creatures at once. That’s particularly useful given he ends up negating that damage and powering up with counters in return. After being under a dollar, Entangler is now reaching closer to $10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.

This weekend is packed with Roblox updates for the spooky season, so here's a roundup of everything you can expect.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Friday October 17th Roblox Updates:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Several experiences are getting their updates in before the weekend starts, giving you plenty of time to participate in them. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Anime Eternal Update</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/anime-eternal-roundup-1760708752658.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">First up is Anime Eternal, which is a fighting game that will take you through different anime-inspired worlds as you level up and build your strength to be the strongest player. This experience is planning to release <a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/3828468475764671127" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Update 20</a><strong> in three parts</strong>. These are planned to launch today, with the second part due on Sunday, 19th October. The final part will conclude on Wednesday, 22nd October. The new updates are set to add a new island, champions, powers, and overall quality of life improvements.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Adopt Me! Update</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/adopt-me-roundup-1760708821332.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Following this is Adopt Me! This notoriously adorable experience that lets you collect and trade pets has already launched Halloween content.

This is a four-in-one pet, which can be changed at the press of a button. There are also <strong>games to</strong> <strong>earn Candy Corn and a Slimingo</strong> you need to track down.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Don't Wake the Brainrots Update</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/brainrots-wake-roundup-1760708942148.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't Wake the Brainrots, which is a game where you sneak around and steal sleeping Brainrots, is launching its<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/772200168546894384" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huge Halloween Event</a>. The update is expected to add new mutations and new Brainrots as part of this limited-time celebration. There are also special guests reported to be turning up for their admin abuse that will take part on Sunday, 19th October. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dandy's World Update</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/dandys-world-roundup-1760708978523.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no surprise that the survival horror experience where you work together to explore the Gardenview Center is making the most of the spooky season. Dandy's World already launched its Halloween content last week, adding new Halloween toons, skins, and a limited-time Halloween floor. You can expect to see <a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/8910346076099969655" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even more skins</a> arrive in today's update.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Looking for </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dandys-world-codes"><strong>Dandy's World codes</strong></a><strong>? Check out our page for newly released codes that coincide with events and any that are still currently active. </strong></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Saturday October 18th Roblox Updates:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Heading into the weekend, you'll see the most-played Roblox experiences launch their usual weekly content. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">99 Nights in the Forest Update</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/99nights-roundup-1760709020986.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">99 Nights in the Forest has sat near the top of the Roblox charts for months, showing that survival horror isn't just for Halloween. For the unfamiliar, the game involves trying to keep your character fed, warm, and sheltered while you rescue missing children and avoid a dangerous deer-like entity at night. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, the game is also keen to get into the Halloween spirit. <a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/8114024574934057586" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Halloween: Week 1</a> begins in 99 Nights in the Forest on Saturday, October 18th. There isn't much information to go on right now, but from the looks of the picture, I'd expect to see some cultists showing up to trick or treat.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Planning to outrun the deer this weekend? See our </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/99-nights-in-the-forest-codes"><strong>99 Nights in the Forest Codes page</strong></a><strong> for extra gems.</strong></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Grow a Garden Update</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/gag-roundup-1760709049462.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The gardening simulator, Grow a Garden, has an abundance of seeds, pets, and mutations to discover as you plant, harvest, and sell your crops. It's already launched a <a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/9186397504608666231" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halloween event with Ghoul Garden</a>, where you can help the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/Ghoul_Garden_Event">witch fill her cauldron</a> and earn Candy Corn to spend at the spooky market. In typical GaG fashion, the event will be extended and continue for a second week. Though it's not clear yet what this will involve, you can always expect new seeds, pets, weather events, and admin abuse before the event starts.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Steal a Brainrot Update</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/sab-roundup-1760709127161.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Steal a Brainrot is a particularly popular Roblox experience where you'll need to capture Brainrots from a conveyor belt and keep them locked away from other players. You can steal Brainrots and have your Brainrots stolen, so we advise you stick close to that lockdown button if you want to protect your Secret Brainrots. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following on from last week's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/steal-a-brainrot/Witch_Fuse_Update">Witch Fuse event</a>, Steal a Brainrot is launching another update this weekend. Last week, there were new Halloween fusions and themed Brainrots, with La Spooky Grande available to those who collected all four Spooky Brainrots. The details for the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/8532495578259260020" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next update</a> haven't been revealed yet, but we're hoping it continues the spooky theme.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Plants vs Brainrots Update</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/pvbroundupo-1760709173536.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This experience, which is a fusion of Grow a Garden, Steal a Brainrot, and Plants Vs Zombies, has quickly climbed the Roblox charts and is regularly releasing new content. In this game, you'll plant seeds that attack Brainrots, helping you capture them. As you earn money, you can unlock better plants and take down rarer Brainrots. Last weekend PVB launched the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/plants-vs-brainrots/How_to_Get_Cards">Cards Update</a>, and this weekend will also introduce new content. While no details have been revealed, it's claiming to be an "<a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/854537099309482613" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">epic update</a>", so watch this space. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Grab yourself some money and gear with our </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/plants-vs-brainrots-codes"><strong>Plants Vs Brainrots Codes</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Fisch Update</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/fischfright-1760709224673.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The fishing simulator with over 400,000+ variations to collect is also joining in with the seasonal fun and launching <a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/2968047596632539696" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FischFright</a>. Considering some of the things that lurk at the bottom of the ocean, there's plenty of opportunity for Fisch to include some truly terrifying specimens.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Sunday October 19th Roblox Updates:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sunday is a quieter day for Roblox updates. There's just one major update we can see taking place from one of the top experiences, and that's Fish It!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Fish It! Update</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/fishit-1760709285774.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Who knew that the people playing Roblox were so into fishing? Fish It! is similar to Fisch, but offers a few more variations for you to collect (1,000,000+ to be a bit more exact). If you want a double dose of scary fishing experiences this weekend, then Fish It! rounds off the week with their <a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/8174015307124048435" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halloween Event</a>. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>If you need some extra luck and potions, see our</strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fish-it-codes"><strong> Fish It! Codes Page.</strong></a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">That's everything for Roblox updates this weekend, but there's undoubtedly plenty more Halloween content on the way for the rest of October.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lauren Harper is an Associate Guides Editor.

For those not familiar, PDP released the same guitar for Xbox and PlayStation consoles previously – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pdp-riffmaster-wireless-guitar-controller-review">IGN gave a great review</a> to the PlayStation version, in fact. Like those controllers, this one costs $149.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new controller can hold a connection up to 30 feet from a Switch or Switch 2, and gets up to 36 hours of play time on a charge. (It's rechargeable via USB-C.) Like the other iterations of this controller, it's collapsible and ships with a shoulder strap. The Riffmaster has an analog stick, strum bar, whammy bar, and 10 fretboard buttons – five at the top of the neck and five more near the body for all those sick shreds you'll be doing. On the pickguard – that's the part that holds the strum and whammy bars – there's also a Home button, plus and minus button, capture button, and d-pad. Alas, there is no GameChat button.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">PDP Riffmaster Guitar for Switch and Switch 2</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But wait, where are you going to do all that shredding?

As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-festival-review">IGN's review</a> found, though, the game didn't quite reach the heights of those hallowed titles at launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Turtle Beach isn't the only one out there releasing guitar-shaped controllers lately.

Plus, it's a cheaper controller, <a href="https://crkd.gg/products/lp-black-tribal-multi-platform" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starting at $114.99</a> for the multi-platform (read: Switch-compatible) Encore Edition. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PDP Riffmaster Wireless Guitar Controller for the Switch and Switch 2 is available now at Turtle Beach's website or on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Riffmaster-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FTZV2JHG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> for $149.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wes is a freelance writer (Freelance Wes, they call him) who has covered technology, gaming, and entertainment steadily since 2020 at Gizmodo, Tom's Hardware, Hardcore Gamer, and most recently, The Verge.

However, the game's English-language translation adjusts the dialogue — and instead simply references Pikachu experiencing "tummy troubles."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-dialogue-confirms-that-pikachu-does-in-fact-poop/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, "Pikachu's Poop" briefly trended on X for some Japanese users after the discovery of a Lumiose City NPC who mentions that their Pokémon is unwell. "Pikachu's pooping more than usual, I'm worried," the character reportedly says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no follow-up dialogue, leaving players without any further detail on Pikachu's bowel habits. Nevertheless, the mention is notable, based on how infrequently Pokémon actually references the creatures' need to poop at all.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">ピカチュウのうんち <a href="https://t.co/rVetTHbftA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/rVetTHbftA</a></p>— てそ (@teso_026) <a href="https://twitter.com/teso_026/status/1978541393812291872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Pokémon series has occaisonally mentioned Pokémon droppings, suggesting that some species' poop makes for good fertilizer (Diglett), while other species' poop can be dangerously explosive (Turtonator). A particular favorite Pokédex of mine mentions the Fire-type creature Darumaka, whose "droppings are hot so people used to put them in their clothes to keep themselves warm." Lovely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to Pikachu, though, and Pokémon Legends: Z-A's English translation of the above scene. As seen by IGN, the explicit mention of poop has been replaced with the following dialogue: "My Pikachu's been having tummy troubles recently. I'm worried..."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/2025101710511600-406e08c26fae3d61e0fdd492a49b8d8e-1760716640663.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pikachu is experiencing tummy troubles. Image credit: IGN/The Pokémon Company.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The English dialogue feels something of a santized take on the game's original script, though in keeping with a franchise about wild creatures that tries to skirt around some of the less family-friendly aspects of their lives whenever possible. Breeding, death and Pokémon eating other Pokémon as food are all canon within the franchise — though it's increasingly rare to hear these elements referenced in the series' games or anime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier today, IGN reported on a viral post <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-there-anything-more-cruel-japanese-pokmon-legends-z-a-players-are-debating-the-rights-and-wrongs-of-eating-food-in-front-of-your-pokmon">discussing whether Pokémon can eat food meant for humans</a> without getting some serious indigestion, sparked by the ability to take in-game photos of your character with their Pokémon hanging out in cafes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When contemplating the essence of a lighthouse (as one so often does), you might think of words like stoic, isolated, or purposeful. But have you ever thought of them as adorable, quirky, or perhaps even charming? Keeper, the atmospheric puzzle platformer from developer Double Fine, cleverly reimagines the often forgotten seaboard structure, reframing it as a lovably sentient scout on a journey through a living world. Blending a kaleidoscopic art style with nostalgic adventure game mechanics, Keeper hides an emotional story underneath all of its visual pizzazz, delivering a brain-tickling odyssey that’s stuck with me far beyond the credits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After being separated from its flock while evading a flood of evil batlike creatures, a seabird named Twig is drawn towards a dormant lighthouse that sits on the outskirts of a mythic island. Stagnant and alone, the unexpected visitor awakens the slumbering lighthouse, causing it to shoot out a beam of warming light and scare away the evil swarm. Keeper’s story is built around the soul-stirring relationship that evolves between this unlikely duo as they fight the island’s eerie infection, navigate its curious biomes, and attempt to climb its possessed, claw-like peak. Despite there not being a single line of dialogue across Keeper’s approximately six-hour run time, I found myself wholly invested in their plight – a testament to how dynamic the pair felt in motion.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Keeper Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It also helps that Keeper is one of the most visually interesting games I’ve ever played. The island's topology is wavy and confusing like an ant farm, with the towering summit somehow sitting at the edge of most frames, teasing you with its proximity. Every nook and cranny of its surreal, painterly world hides vast wells of depth with craggy coral, forgotten cave structures, and vibrant twisting vines intersecting like details in a Where’s Wally book. The use of fixed camera angles in Keeper is particularly inspired and evokes a cinematic atmosphere once cultivated by games like Grim Fandango and Silent Hill. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeper doesn’t explicitly explain the lore behind its mythical, post-apocalyptic setting, instead relying on visual clues like crumpled houses and rewilded cityscapes to create a sense of danger and scale. It’s helpful that the environments you saunter through blend seamlessly together, too, with a change in the orchestration and colour palette alerting you to a new area or checkpoint more often than a loading screen. This HUD-less approach better allows you to lose yourself in Keeper’s spectacular landscapes, increasing your investment in the twosome and encouraging you to play around with your powers and discover tidbits of lore littered throughout. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The HUD-less approach allows you to lose yourself in spectacular landscapes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of interacting with the world, your lighthouse powers are relatively limited but smartly utilized. You have the ability to shoot beams of light and run through obstacles to knock them down, as well as send your avian mate to pull vines or interact with levers to open doors. At first, the path forward is simple enough and involves using your light to grow vines into bridges or frighten creatures into dropping key items you need to progress. Gradually, though, Keeper increases its challenge, introducing a healthy mixture of logic and platforming puzzles that require you to weave a few interactions together in order to progress. One such puzzle involved finding and pulling a series of hidden levers to create a path through a rushing waterfall – to sniff out the levers, I needed to bound around the space and use my beam to explode fuzzy brain-like nodes, lower platforms, and grow patches of alien plants.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not every reaction you can elicit serves a gameplay-specific purpose, though, and you can also wield these powers to impact the Seussian flora and fauna around you, using your light to make trees shift in color or shiver with life. Elsewhere, curious critters react with adorable animations along the edges of paths as you walk by. It can’t be overstated that almost every screenshot of Keeper effortlessly looks like a work of art. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While your base skills remain largely the same throughout the story, the world changes in a way that keeps things fresh. For example, your humble torch can eventually activate strange monuments that twist time forwards and backwards, briefly turning Twig into a ghost that can fly through walls and rotate cogs or an egg that can weigh down pressure plates – who says you can’t teach an old building new tricks? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If this sounds a bit surreal, that’s because it is, but somehow it all makes sense in the context of Keeper’s intriguing world. Admittedly, it helps that each new mechanic is so thoughtfully integrated into both the story and the worldbuilding at large, with Keeper peppering in subtle tutorials through a handful of unmissable interactions at the start of each new area. Similar to Cyan World’s groundbreaking puzzle game Myst, Double Fine masterfully teaches you how to solve the puzzles ahead without overexplaining them, which helps maintain a sense of momentum without leaving you totally untethered from the larger plot.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Jaw-dropping sights are further bolstered by an exquisite soundtrack.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there’s no rush to make it to the top of the mountain. Half the joy of Keeper is in the journey, and there are plenty of jaw-dropping sights to gawk at along the way. Each level is its own microcosm screaming with personality. You’ll visit the ethereal Pollen Fields, which are filled with cotton candy shrubs and cliff faces that look like splodges of paint someone has haphazardly run their hands through, as well as the cleverly named Horologe, a steampunk-esque city that feels architecturally Grecian. These locations are often disorienting, with brush stroke detailing and scratchy textures that reinforce the organic, handmade aesthetic. They are further bolstered by an exquisite soundtrack from composer David Earl, whose twinkling, dreamy arrangements strike a steady balance between calming and eerie, coating the world in a sense of unease. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not all, though, as each area is inhabited by its own creatures, too, which range from towering multi-eyed whales to rocks with legs and narrow cylindrical dragons whose coats look like woven quilts. This smorgasbord of oddities made me feel like a kid at the aquarium, using my lighthouse torch to “tap at the glass” in search of reactions. Even with their uncanny designs, the critters all fit into Keeper’s world as if they evolved there over centuries in order to survive – a theme that bleeds into every corner of this existential story. 
</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sarah's favourite games with surreal settings</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The themes at play aren’t overly complex, though understanding them does require you to read between the lines. As a lonely lighthouse, the ideas of evolution and isolation are touched on – but importantly, your interpretation of each conversation-less cutscene or puzzle will surely be influenced by your own experiences in a way that feels intentional. For me, Keeper came across as an exploration of friendship, adaptation, and the inimitable power of self-belief in a world that is struggling to cope under an oppressive force. Maybe it will mean something different to you. While I was occasionally left longing for more concrete answers to its questions, similar to the process of staring at a painting, this tale leaves the door open for you to find meaning in both the artist's intentions as well as your own. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve always considered Double Fine the Willy Wonka of game developers, and Keeper feels like a prime example of why. It walks and talks like a fairly digestible adventure game, but there’s also a sense of experimentation and whimsy that makes it hard to put into any one box. Caught somewhere between the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Yqw_f26SvM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>‘Three Course Dinner Chewing Gum</u></a>’ and a <a href="https://youtu.be/lsEPqUmHDTo?t=28" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ratatouille flashback</u></a>, Keeper flooded my senses, leaving me open to contemplate its world as a standalone creation as well as a mirror of my own. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">A surreal painting come to life, Keeper is a stunning puzzle game that carefully balances its moreish mechanics with a heartfelt story. Its levels are teeming with life to interact with and interesting objects to ogle, with each scene framed by a percussive driving score. The leading duo might not speak. But, well-executed animations and a soundboard of affecting chirps and creaks imbue them with a spirit that grows on you fast. Adorable in premise, Keeper is a psychedelic exploration of life packed into a brief runtime that’s well worth experiencing at least once in your lifetime.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/keeper-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Look out below! Team Meat's sadistic meat mascot is finally leaping into the third dimension with Super Meat Boy 3D, scheduled for early 2026 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. It's a bold step forward for a series that originally started its life as a Flash-based sidescroller on Newgrounds, translating the blood-soaked precision platforming that defined the original 2010 cult classic into a fully three-dimensional space. Based on our hands-on time with the newest preview build, we can confidently say this isn't just the same old Super Meat Boy. Instead, it’s shaping up to be a thoughtful reimagining that captures the essence of what makes the series beloved while embracing new possibilities that only 3D can offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar with the series, Super Meat Boy is a high-speed platformer that follows the adventures of a skinless protagonist attempting to rescue his girlfriend – Bandage Girl – from the villainous Dr. Fetus… a literal fetus in a jar with a perpetual grudge. Unlike the original game and its 2020 sequel, both of which are legendary for their punishing difficulty and death-defying speed, Super Meat Boy 3D feels less unfairly brutal and more <em>chill</em> while retaining some of the harder challenges for those who want to reclaim the series' hardcore platforming roots in 3D.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Super Meat Boy 3D Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The preview build on Steam opens with an eye-catching menu, and the interface is both immediately functional and slick-looking. One quick tap of the A button on your controller and you’re thrust into the action within seconds – but, if you linger in the main menu a bit longer, you may find yourself wandering into the robust settings menu, which reveals decently comprehensive accessibility options and good flexibility in the graphics department as well. It’s cool to see options to toggle on a ground distance helper, for instance, which projects where you'll land when airborne. There's also a replay character slider that determines how many ghostly versions of Meat Boy appear in the post-level replays, watching your recorded run play back alongside multiple failed attempts in swarms of up to 100 little guys.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The controls translate Super Meat Boy's responsive movement into 3D with surprising grace.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The controls translate Super Meat Boy's responsive movement into 3D with surprising grace. On an Xbox controller, jumping, sprinting, wall-running, and dashing all feel snappy and precise. Meat Boy does have a slightly floaty quality in midair that took a few untimely deaths to get the hang of, but a midair dash ability (default mapped to X) allows you to correct trajectory mistakes on the fly – a crucial addition given the added complexity of navigating 3D space. Wall-running and wall-jumping work similarly to the original's wall-slides, letting you bounce between vertical surfaces to reach higher platforms. Interestingly, the preview build lacks the punch ability mentioned in the control scheme and features no combat whatsoever, leaving us curious whether enemy encounters will play any role in the final release or if this remains a pure obstacle-course platformer.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">A Bloody Good Time</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The level design effectively utilizes verticality in ways its 2D predecessors couldn't, with multi-tiered structures that had us jumping upward off walls, dashing across gaps, and ground-slamming down vertical shafts to avoid descending spike balls. The ground slam (mapped to B) proved more useful than we initially expected, letting us rapidly descend to dodge hazards that dropped from above. Environmental obstacles include classic platformer staples, like buzz saws, bear traps, crumbling platforms, and industrial crushers – alongside new physics-based challenges like the aforementioned spike balls, which drop into peculiarly-located chutes that require you first to bypass other obstacles and then properly time your descent to survive.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">True to series tradition, death comes frequently and gruesomely. As one might expect, Super Meat Boy 3D’s cube of exposed muscle tissue is prone to meeting countless splattery ends, immediately respawning him at the level start with the timer reset. The blood trail Meat Boy leaves on every surface he touches paints increasingly macabre patterns across the pastel environments with each attempt, and it's darkly comical watching pristine grassy fields transform into crime scenes. The sound design enhances this with squelchy, splattery audio that recalls Splatoon's ink-based aesthetic, while environmental sounds like the whir of saw blades and the mechanical grinding of crushers create an appropriately cartoony yet threatening audio landscape.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Film Study</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Performance is measured purely by completion time and death count, with letter grades awarded based on how quickly you reach each level's exit. An A+ rank requires finishing under a target time with zero deaths, which is a tall order that demands memorization and flawless execution. There's no score system, no collectible currency, just you versus the clock and your own mortality. We did discover hidden collectible band-aids tucked into secret areas behind destructible wooden walls, though their purpose remains unclear in the preview build. Whether they unlock content, costumes, or bonus levels in the full game is anyone's guess.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of post-game content, the post-level replay system deserves special mention as one of the preview's most entertaining features. After completing a stage, you watch your successful run play back while multiple ghost versions of Meat Boy attempt the same route, most meeting horrible deaths before one mirror-image completes the course following your exact path. It's simultaneously satisfying and hilarious, transforming your hard-earned victories into miniature spectacles of failure. The max replay characters setting lets you crank this up, filling the screen with doomed meat cubes.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Who’s the Boss?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">What's less clear is the scope of the full release. The preview build contained no boss fights (though a cutscene showed what appeared to be a giant robot), no multiplayer options, and a theater mode that remained inaccessible. The narrative setup – Dr. Fetus once again kidnapping someone dear to Meat Boy, this time appearing to be Bandage Girl based on her pink coloring – suggests we're returning to familiar story beats, though the series has never prioritized plot, and from what I’ve seen so far, that trend isn’t set to change with its first 3D outing. The linear level structure and lack of significant exploration or secret-hunting may disappoint players expecting more Metroidvania-style progression, though this has always been Super Meat Boy's MO: pure, distilled platforming challenge without excessive baggage.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Meat Boy 3D’s decently challenging and often enjoyable gameplay loop settles into a zen-like flow state once you accept the trial-and-error nature of mastery in its colorful world. This is very much a "podcast game" – something you can successfully zone out to while listening to something else, and by the fifth run through the preview build, we couldn’t help but think about how strong a fit it’ll be for Steam Deck owners who like to sneak in play sessions before bed. That's not necessarily criticism; there's value in games that don't demand your complete emotional investment, and this is undeniably one of those games. It’s just a shame that there’s no Switch 2 version currently announced. Half-joking!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nuts and Bolts</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The difficulty, while present, didn’t reach the soul-crushing heights the series is notorious for, at least in these early stages, but that’s not such a bad thing to bring in a broader playerbase – as long as the final version still provides ample challenge to series fans. Whether that manifests in later worlds or if Team Meat has softened the challenge for broader appeal remains to be seen, but I’m hoping it's the former.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/smb3d-screenshot-2-1760658237906.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Graphically, Super Meat Boy 3D strikes a pleasing balance between the series' cartoonish aesthetic and modern rendering techniques for an increasingly atmospheric experience as the levels progress. The preview build already teases robust graphics options, including a nice list of anti-aliasing methods, post-processing effects, shadow quality, global illumination, reflections, and foliage density. While DLSS remained grayed out in my build, the game ran silky smooth at near-144fps on an RTX 4070Ti, with excellent optimization even at maximum settings on an ultrawide 3440x1440 display. The environments pop with visual personality: grassy starting areas give way to burning forests with spinning saw blades embedded in charred trees, which then transition into grimy industrial zones filled with crushers, spike-dropping machines, and pools of toxic waste. Everything maintains that high-contrast, storybook-meets-nightmare quality that defined the original, but with added geometric complexity and environmental detail that wouldn't be possible in 2D.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bring the Pain</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Comparisons to other modern 3D platformers are inevitable, but may be a bit unfair to the scope that Super Meat Boy 3D is tackling. What we’ve played so far lacks Astro Bot's inventively kinetic mechanics and character-driven charm, Mario Odyssey's exploratory freedom, or even Crash Bandicoot 4's level design variety. Instead, Super Meat Boy 3D feels more akin to Ghost Runner's fast-paced, die-and-retry philosophy mixed with the geometric verticality and graphical style of Pac-Man World II – and then just heavily distilled from there, down to something much smaller and tighter, like a little cube of tightly-packaged meat in a convenience store freezer. There are no rings or coins to collect here: just brutal platforming, and this reinvention does it smoothly enough to feel satisfying even after several back-to-back runs of the same preview content.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/smb3d-screenshot-5-1760658250512.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Your skills will improve with each run, hitting more A+ ranks as your muscle memory develops. At least that addictive "just one more try" quality that defined the original is totally present here. The question is whether Team Meat can sustain that momentum across a full game, and whether enough content, variety, and surprises await in the final release to justify the journey into 3D.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Meat Boy 3D shows promise as a faithful translation of the series' darker cartoon comedy appeal into three dimensions, with responsive controls, strong performance, and level design that embraces verticality while maintaining the tight challenge loops that made the original special. But, at least at this point in its development cycle, significant questions remain about the scope of its content upon release, how well its combat will feel in action, what those hidden collectibles unlock, and if this tight-knit formula can stay fresh throughout a complete game.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/super-meat-boy-3d-makes-great-use-of-its-extra-dimension]]></content:encoded>
