            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We asked our community just how far we should push the gore."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Lords of the Fallen II publisher CI Games has shown gameplay footage of its Soulslike sequel during The Game Awards 2025, featuring new character Omeuras and enemy limbs flying everywhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of tonight's showing, IGN asked CI Games for more detail on what we'd just seen, keen for more detail ahead of the game's  launch at some point in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most prominent in the trailer is Omeuras, who CI Games creative strategist Ryan Hill told IGN is one of the sequel's central characters. She's brought to life by Hannah Melbourne, who previously played Agrias Oaks in Final Fantasy Tactics, and The Sorceress in Path of Exile 2.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/11/1-4-1765476366423.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">"With the sequel, we wanted to craft a narrative that's more accessible and character-driven, while still honouring the environmental storytelling that Soulslike fans love," Hill said. "Players who want to dive deep into the lore absolutely can, but we also want every player to reach the end of the game understanding the journey they've taken and the pivotal role they've played in shaping this world."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another key focus in the trailer is Lords of the Fallen II's new dismemberment feature, which allows you to lop limbs off enemies like nobody's business. Lords of the Fallen has never been squeamish with its blood and guts, but its developers say they have heard the call from fans for even more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we asked our community just how far we should push the gore in the next Lords of the Fallen, the answer was loud and unanimous: 'go all in'," Hill noted. "This is a game made by adults for adults, and we didn't want to dilute the brutality or intensity of that experience. Soulslikes thrive on challenge, and that rush you get when defeating an enemy is unlike anything else. Enhancing that moment with a dynamic dismemberment system takes the satisfaction to another level - instead of enemies simply ragdolling to the floor, players can literally tear them apart."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, can every limb be removed? "Yes - every limb can be removed."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tonight's showing for Lords of the Fallen 2 comes just hours after CI Games launched a final surprise update for its predecessor, capping off almost two years' of post-launch support that has helped turn player sentiment around. While those updates have been welcomed, CI Games said it had learnt from the experience, and been listening to fan feedback "from day one."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The journey from launch to Lords of the Fallen Version 2.5 (released yesterday) was transformative for our team. Over 70 updates later, the game evolved substantially, and that evolution was driven directly by our relationship with the community. Those learnings shaped not only how we build, but how we listen," Hill concluded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For the sequel, we’ve been actively engaging our fast-growing community from day one, understanding exactly what they want from the next chapter. You can already see some of those requests reflected in our new gameplay reveal trailer: a more varied game world, more distinctive and memorable boss encounters, and a deeper, more meaningful Umbral realm experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Light at the end of the tunnel.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard has fully unveiled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> expansion Lord of Hatred, confirming that it includes not one but two new classes, including the Paladin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At The Game Awards 2025, Blizzard announced an April 28, 2026 release date for Lord of Hatred, which will see the Age of Hatred Saga, as Blizzard calls it, reach its climax. Campaign wise, players go up against eternal evil, Mephisto, but there’s a surprise return for Diablo 4 antagonist Lilith, who is back from the dead — shock horror! — after the events of the Diablo 4 campaign. Lord of Hatred adds the new region of Skovos, and there are significant gameplay changes, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big news here is a pre-purchase of Lord of Hatred grants immediate access to the Paladin class, which is a fan-favorite from Diablo 2 and one of the most-requested classes for Diablo 4. Blizzard didn’t say what the mystery second class is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the story setup:</p><blockquote>In the aftermath of Vessel of Hatred, this next chapter drives players toward their final stand against Mephisto, whose deception and spreading influence threaten to twist Sanctuary into a world consumed by malice. As Hell’s legions surge and the ancient Pools of Creation draw Mephisto ever closer, the fate of humanity hangs by a thread. To stop him, the Wanderer must embrace an old foe long believed to be dead. Lilith returns, her prophetic last words echoing true, forcing a perilous alliance bound by necessity rather than trust. With time and allies running out, the Wanderer is in a desperate race to stop Mephisto before hatred reshapes the world forever.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The Paladin, as you’d expect, revolves around hammer and shield gameplay, and smites enemies with Holy Light power. The mystery second class “looms on the dark horizon,” Blizzard said, adding: “its power undeniable, its arrival poised to reshape the battlefield when Lord of Hatred launches in April.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skovos is the ancestral birthplace of the first civilization and the former home of Lilith and Inarius. It stands as Sanctuary’s oldest and most storied region. Now ruled by The Oracle and the Amazon Queen, this never-before-seen in-game land blends volcanic coasts, storm-lashed forests, and waterlogged ruins steeped in forgotten lore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The expansion also reworks the Skill Trees to introduce new class-specific variants and expanded level caps, offering fresh buildcraft and strategic depth across all eight classes. There’s a new Loot Filter system to help you target desired gear more efficiently. Crafting is enhanced, with the return of the Horadric Cube. The new Talisman unlocks powerful set bonuses, expanding late-game customization.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Veteran players will be keen to know about the overhauled endgame, which you can tap into once you’ve finished the campaign. War Plans let players craft their own endgame progression path, selecting favored activities and layering strategic modifiers as they push toward high-value rewards. The Echoing Hatred stands as the Age of Hatred’s ultimate test: a relentless gauntlet of demonic hordes designed to challenge even the strongest builds. Meanwhile, for something completely different, the expansion adds Fishing!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lord of Hatred includes the full Vessel of Hatred expansion, which players can access instantly via pre-purchase. Players who pre-purchase gain early access to the Paladin class, one extra Stash Tab, two more Character Slots, and three World of Warcraft décor items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Sons of the Forest launched in 2024.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Endnight Games showed up for The Game Awards 2025 with what may be one of the most unexpected announcements of the night: Forest 3 is coming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A trailer for the latest in its line of popular survival games revealed a visual style unlike anything the series has seen so far. It’s a lot to digest, as first-person gameplay footage showed off lots of sci-fi technology, what seems to be a shoulder-mounted crane, one crashed spaceship, and many new, dangerous environments to explore.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Now for a completely unexpected world premiere. Here’s Forest 3! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheGameAwards?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#TheGameAwards</a> <a href="https://t.co/kKiF7b4rAS" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/kKiF7b4rAS</a></p>— The Game Awards (@thegameawards) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1999306602436837419?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">As holgram chess and futuristic doors fade into the background, it's only toward the end of the Forst 3 reveal trailer that we see some of that misty horror atmosphere fans have come to love the series for. The monsters in this new world seems to be just as strange, too, with that giant Lovecraftian beast being the most intimidating of the bunch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear how Forest 3 will pick up where Sons of the Forest left off or how its new sci-fi spin will affect gameplay. One thing is for sure, though: Endnight definitely has more tricks up its sleeves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Endnight began its survival series with The Forest in 2018 and followed it up with Sons of the Forest in 2024. With the studio's last game still so fresh in our minds, it's no surprise to see the team keeping their cards close to their chest when it comes to Forest 3. A release date and platforms have not be announced, but we can likely expect to see Forest 3 come to PC.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN gave Sons of the Forest a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sons-of-the-forest-review">9/10 review</a> upon its 1.0 launch last year. At the time, we said, "Sons of the Forest takes everything its predecessor did well and does it a little bit better." It's unclear if Forest 3 will launch in eary access as its predecessors did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from The Game Awards 2025, you can check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced"><u>everything announced</u></a> at The Game Awards 2025.
