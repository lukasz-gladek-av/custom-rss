R. Martin has issued the strongest tease yet that an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> movie may come to pass, but has acknowledged a significant blocker to his potential involvement with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game of Thrones creator famously dreamed up the world and history of FromSoftware’s Elden Ring, which went on to become one of the best-selling games of 2022. FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco leaned heavily on Martin’s involvement in promotional material, and the game credits begin by saying the Elden Ring world was created by FromSoftware chief Hidetaki Miyazaki and George R. R. Martin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, would George R. R. Martin be interested in coming back for a sequel to Elden Ring, if he’s asked? That’s the question IGN put to the man himself as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/fanfest">IGN Fan Fest 2025</a>. In his response, Martin sidestepped Elden Ring 2, but did drop a big hint that an Elden Ring movie could be in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Well, I can't say too much about it, but there is some talk about making a movie out of Elden Ring,” Martin said.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/21/gettyimages-1472023146-1740134288274.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">George R. R. Martin has hinted that an Elden Ring movie may be in the works.

And indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-open-to-elden-ring-movie-if-a-very-strong-partner-were-to-step-in">FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki has said he’d be open to an adaptation of Elden Ring</a>, but only if a “very strong partner” were to come into play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t see any reason to deny another interpretation or adaptation of Elden Ring, a movie for example,” explained Miyazaki in an interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Guardian</u></a>. “But I don’t think myself, or FromSoftware, have the knowledge or ability to produce something in a different medium.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So that’s where a very strong partner would come into play,” continued Miyazaki. “We’d have to build a lot of trust and agreement on whatever it is we’re trying to achieve, but there’s interest, for sure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, speaking to IGN, George R. R. Martin acknowledged that there may be a significant blocker to any heavy involvement he may have with the Elden Ring movie: he’s still working on The Winds of Winter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We'll see if that [the Elden Ring movie] comes to pass and what the extent of my involvement was, I don't know,” he said. “I'm a few years behind with my latest book, so that also limits the amount of things that I can do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy novels have long, long, <em>long, </em>awaited the planned sixth entry in the series, The Winds of Winter. But after more than a decade of delays, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/george-r-r-martin-isnt-sure-hell-ever-finish-the-winds-of-winter-but-its-still-a-priority">even Martin is acknowledging the possibility that it may never come to be</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December, Martin said: “Unfortunately, I am 13 years late. Every time I say that, I’m [like], ‘How could I be 13 years late?’ I don’t know, it happens a day at a time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But that’s still a priority," he continued. "A lot of people are already writing obituaries for me. [They’re saying] ‘Oh, he’ll never be finished.’ Maybe they’re right. I don’t know. I’m alive right now! I seem pretty vital!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's only the latest in what's been an increasingly bleak wait for The Winds of Winter, with the most recent entry in the series, A Dance With Dragons, publishing in 2011. That's the same year that HBO premiered the insanely popular TV series Game of Thrones, which is based on the A Song of Ice and Fire series and drew <em>a lot</em> more eyes to the world of Westeros.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Elden Ring, Martin explained his work on the game, telling IGN how he helped FromSoftware on worldbuilding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“... when they came to me, FromSoftware, they wanted the world. They knew the action of Elden Ring that the players would get into would be in the ‘present.’ But something had created that present, had created that world. So where did that world come from? And I've done a lot of world building, most notably on Westeros and the backgrounds of A Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones. And I like doing world building. So what had happened 5,000, 10,000 years before the current day action in Elden Ring that led them to that place? And I had some ideas about the magic and the runes. There was a lot about runes. And I worked it all out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was interesting that the team flew in and we had a number of sessions and they would fly back and do their magic, and then they would come back here a couple months later and show me what they had, which was always amazing to see what they came up with.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Was everything Martin wrote used in the game, or is there more material that could be used in future installments?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, I think especially when you're world building, there's always more that you actually see on the screen,” Martin replied.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And that's true of any of these big epic fantasies. I mean, you look at Tolkien and there are hundreds of pages of past history before you get to even the era of the Hobbit and dozens of kings and wars and things like that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Amanda Edwards/WireImage.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-might-be-the-series-coziest-jrpg-yet-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After over two dozen mainline games, I can only imagine how difficult it must be to innovate and stay relevant in an era where a great game is coming out every few weeks, but that’s exactly what KOEI TECMO aims to do with the next entry in its long-running Atelier JRPG series, Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories and the Envisioned Land. After spending over six hours gathering resources, doing Sailor Moon-esque magical dancing rituals, and riding around on a motorbike, I’m inclined to believe they’ll pull off just that, yet again. With more engaging combat, improved visuals, more convenient crafting, and an entirely new building system that lets you put your own personal touch on the world, there’s quite a bit to be optimistic about, even if what I saw of the story and characters was, at least so far in the opening hours, pretty boilerplate stuff for the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played any of the recent Atelier games, then you probably won’t be shocked by Atelier Yumia at first glance. All three of the pillars that have been around since its conception are still alive and well: exploration, where you run around collecting resources and solving puzzles; combat, where you fight baddens with a party chock-full of pretty anime friends, and synthesis, where you combine your hard-won resources into alchemical creations that make you stronger. But each has been given a substantial overhaul (not to mention a serious facelift) that breathes new life into a familiar formula.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat seems to be getting the biggest rework, with action-based systems that let you perfect parry, dodge out of the way, and switch to different range bands depending on whether you’d like to thwack enemies in melee or take them down from a distance. At lower levels, combat seemed fairly undemanding, as I was able to just unload every ability I had, swap to other characters to do the same, then repeat it all again, ending most encounters in a matter of seconds, but later on (and especially when I wasn’t properly leveled) I seriously got rinsed if I wasn’t paying attention to enemy attack patterns and working on my timing. It never got especially challenging so long as I was properly leveled, but it was nice to see a less passive combat system that I couldn’t just steamroll through while on autopilot.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat seems to be getting the biggest rework.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploration also had some improvements, like having a gun to stun enemies and collect resources at a distance, ziplines that help you navigate the map more easily once you find and activate both sides of the line, and, crucially, a badass motorcycle for you to speed around on that makes getting around much easier. Finally, there’s Synthesis, which in typically Atelier fashion is so dang complicated, you could spend quite a bit of time customizing and min-maxing every aspect of your gear and crafting new items and attacks to use in battle. Or, if you don’t have the patience like me, you can just hit “auto mode” and it’ll automatically optimize all of it for you. Not that I don’t enjoy this aspect of the series, but it’s certainly nice to have the option of leaping back into the action quickly for times where I wasn’t in the mood to tinker.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Atelier Yumia also shakes things up by adding a fourth fairly significant activity to the list of things to do as you explore and level up: the ability to build and customize settlements throughout the world map. That’s right – Atelier Yumia seems to be leaning into the cozy craze, so now you can have a little bit of Animal Crossing or Sims with your JRPG by constructing your fantasy cottage on a patch of land and spending some quality downtime with your party members. I was only able to dabble in this a bit, given the constraint of the resources available to me in the early part of the story, but I could definitely see myself sinking quite a bit of time into taming the wilds with an elaborately decorated home.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all Atelier has going for it, I will say that it did very little to make itself stand out in terms of story. The characters and foreshadowing of the undoubtedly epic and convoluted story that starts to develop in the opening hours aren’t bad by any means, but at least so far everything has been quite predictable and retreads a lot of ground we’ve seen from JRPGs of the past. This is especially true of the characters I met during my explorations, like the ditzy by wholesome Isla and the stoic and no-nonsense Viktor, both of whom I feel like I’ve seen half a hundred times already. But this is the beginning of a JRPG, so in all likelihood it’s just going to take a while for the story to start rolling or for characters to show their true colors to any level of satisfaction, leaving plenty of opportunity for my concerns to disappear given more time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that Atelier Yumia marks the first time the series will appear on the Xbox platform, and as a Westerner who would quite like more JRPGs to be readily available, that’s pretty awesome to see. Achievement unlocked!</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
