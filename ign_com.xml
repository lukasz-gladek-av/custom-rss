            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-pc-benchmark-and-new-system-requirements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is just a few weeks away, and Capcom has released a PC benchmark for players to see if their system is up to snuff. Alongside that, the PC system requirements have been officially lowered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As announced during yesterday's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-spotlight-february-2025-and-monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-everything-announced">Capcom Spotlight</a>, the PC benchmark for Monster Hunter Wilds is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>live on Steam right now</u></a>. The tool will need to compile some shaders once it's loaded up, but otherwise it's fairly easy to run and see where your computer lands. It's a good idea to check, especially if you're curious about how the updated system requirements might affect your performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-system-requirements-revealed"><u>Previously</u></a>, the system requirements for hitting 1080p and 60 frames per second (with Frame Generation enabled) called for an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, or AMD Radeon RX 6700XT graphics card; an Intel Core i5-11600K, Intel Core i5-12400, AMD Ryzen 5 3600X, or AMD Ryzen 5 5500 CPU; and 16 GB of RAM.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/benchmark/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an updated page alongside the benchmark</u></a>, Capcom appears to have lowered the requirements. For Recommended, or 1080p (FHD) with 60 frames per second and Frame Generation enabled, here are the new requirements:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>OS: </strong>Windows 10 (64-bit required) / Windows 11 (64-bit required)</li><li><strong>Processor: </strong>Intel Core i5-10400 / Intel Core i3-12100 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600</li><li><strong>Memory: </strong>16 GB</li><li><strong>Graphics Card (GPU): </strong>GeForce RTX 2060 Super / Radeon RX 6600 (8 GB VRAM)</li><li><strong>Storage: </strong>75 GB (SS required)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">This should, per Capcom's site, have Monster Hunter Wilds running at 1080p and 60 frames per second with Frame Generation enabled. As you might have noticed, it's a slight but still noticeable down-tick in requirements.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">All Monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Users are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ihv19n/monster_hunter_wilds_requirements_officially/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>already reporting some noticeable benefits to performance</u></a> in the benchmark compared to the beta test, though that's with Frame Generation enabled. Steam Deck still doesn't seem likely; while the gaming rig I tested passed with flying colors, my personal attempt on the Deck didn't elicit promising results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's noticeable, alongside the processing changes, is the difference in storage size. Before, Monster Hunter Wilds called for 140 GB of available space on your SSD; now, it's 75 GB. As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/whats-up-with-these-huge-video-game-install-sizes"><u>file sizes seem to constantly grow year-over-year</u></a>, it's surprising to see such a change.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on what's in store for Monster Hunter Wilds, be sure to read up on our recent IGN First coverage, showcasing bouts with fearsome beasts <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/monster-hunter-wilds-oilwell-basin-apex-nu-udra-full-hunt-4k-ign-first"><u>like the apex monster Nu Udra</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-the-final-preview-ign-first"><u>our final hands-on impressions of Capcom's latest Monster Hunter</u></a> before it arrives later this month. Monster Hunter Wilds is out for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC on February 28, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

"That was the biggest shock," he said.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/05/91e9vcxn6fl-ac-sl1500-1738776824510.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Monster Hunter 4 launched exclusively on the Nintendo 3DS in 2013. Ultimate launched a year later.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter was a colossal hit on the PlayStation Portable, to the point where it had two exclusive games, but Yoshida had no idea Nintendo had secured this new game for its own console. To make matters worse, it then slashed the price of the 3DS by $100, putting it well below the PlayStation Vita.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After launch, both Nintendo 3DS and Vita were $250 but they dropped $100," Yoshida said. "I was like, 'Oh my god'. And [then they] announced the biggest game... The biggest game on PSP was Monster Hunter. And that game is going to come out on Nintendo 3DS exclusively. I was like, 'Oh no.' That was the biggest shock."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-retiring-from-sony-in-january">Yoshida retired in January after more than three decades with Sony</a>, where he became a face of the PlayStation brand and was beloved by fans worldwide. His no longer being with the company has allowed Yoshida to share some previously unheard insight such as this, however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-wouldve-tried-to-resist-sonys-live-service-push">Yoshida has also said how he'd have tried to resist Sony's embattled live service push</a> and even given his two cents on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hasnt-sony-done-anything-more-with-bloodborne-playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-personal-theory">why it won't make a remake or sequel to cult classic Bloodborne</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Stuart Wilson/BAFTA/Getty Images for BAFTA.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
