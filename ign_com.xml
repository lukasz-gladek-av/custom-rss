Now, years later, it remains on hold, but one Valve developer has given fans a glimpse at what might have been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced during the 2017 Game Awards, In The Valley of Gods is set in Egypt during the late 1920s. It stars Rashida and Zora, a pair of documentary filmmakers who accidentally made it big with a hit movie but have since seen their careers go off a cliff. They reunite years later after receiving information about the lost Tomb of Nefertiti, with a goal of reigniting their careers by documenting their trip to Egypt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve visual effects developer Matt Wilde took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skilful.bsky.social/post/3lakopz32k22x" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a> to publish a six second water test created by Camp Santo before the studio’s move to Valve. It shows the player character bobbing in impressively realistic water while looking out from inside a cave at the other protagonist from a first-person perspective. “I do often tend to work on liquidy things,” Wilde said.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Matthew Wilde, the Valve developer behind the water shader for Counter-Strike 2, has shared a rare gameplay footage. It shows the water technology that was tested for In The Valley of Gods before Valve acquired the company Campo Santo. Team shelved the game not so long after… <a href="https://t.co/wIs6Im8KYx" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/wIs6Im8KYx</a></p>— ‎Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1855941378301141312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a reference to Wilde’s work on Valve's 2020 virtual reality exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a>, which caught attention for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-alyx-update-liquid-physics-14">ultra realistic liquid in glass bottles</a>. More recently, Wilde worked on Counter-Strike 2’s water and effects.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Spent a good chunk of lock-down doing this important work. Boozy liquid shader, now available in the latest update for Half-Life: Alyx <a href="https://t.co/Iw9h98pmEg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Iw9h98pmEg</a></p>— Matthew Wilde (@skilful) <a href="https://twitter.com/skilful/status/1265875309980643329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 28, 2020</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Wilde’s In The Valley of Gods clip obviously sparks questions about whether Camp Santo / Valve will one day return to the game. “To fans looking forward to In The Valley of Gods, it’s probably clear that the optimistic ‘2019’ at the end of the announcement trailer isn’t going to be accurate,” Campo Santo co-founder Jake Rodkin said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/03/in-the-valley-of-gods-on-hold-as-campo-santo-devs-work-on-other-valve-projects">when it was announced that In The Valley of Gods had been put on hold</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the end, Valve Time makes fools of us all. But yes, developers from the former Campo Santo team have joined other projects at Valve, including Half-Life: Alyx.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So to answer your question as of today, In The Valley of Gods development is on hold — but it certainly feels like a project people can and may return to. And when that happens, we’ll find an exciting way to let fans know.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/687440/In_The_Valley_of_Gods/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In The Valley of Gods’ Steam page is still live</a> — with a December 2029 release window. Perhaps that will end up being true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skilful.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Matthew Wilde / Bluesky</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
