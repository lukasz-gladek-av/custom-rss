            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you log in to keep up with the NBA or you’re just a casual fan of video games, chances are, you’ve seen a lot of talk about content creators Kingsman265, Cece, zazzastack, and an infamous $40,000 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> tournament recently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What began as a livestreamed spat between esports teammates has since evolved into an inescapable beast of a trending topic that quickly broke containment in the Marvel Rivals community. But who are these people? Why are thousands rallying behind their favorite online personalities? And why are the Atlanta Hawks posting TikToks about a Marvel Rivals tournament?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The saga many are calling the “Kingsman265 drama” began just earlier this month and is transforming every day, so we did our best to explain the story so far for those who need to know what’s got the internet so worked up.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— BasimZB (@BasimZB) <a href="https://twitter.com/BasimZB/status/2010684133144469652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 12, 2026</a></blockquote> <h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Deadpool Creator Cup</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase Games’ Marvel hero shooter became the center of attention when a relatively small Marvel Rivals esports content creator named Kingsman265 uploaded <a href="https://youtu.be/FyKlnqgNtXs?si=6TkwNAznqnHbzwNl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a YouTube video</u></a> titled, “I was kicked from a $40,000 tournament…” on January 17, 2026. That tournament, hosted by streamer BasimZB, was known as the Deadpool Creator Cup, a somewhat small competition advertised to feature 48 creators as Deadpool joined Marvel Rivals. According to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bogur/clip/RefinedArtisticMagpieM4xHeh-dHXmqElf2n9s1HSO" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a number of competitors</u></a> invited to the tourney, the competition didn’t include a $40,000 prize pool until after invites had been sent out and many had already signed on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In this video I show all perspectives, POV's and exactly why I was removed,” Kingsman says in the video’s description. “With this being one of the biggest tournaments I've played in, and $40,000 on the line with the prize pool being $18,000 for first place, AKA $3,000 per person.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of Kingsman’s videos hover around 25,000 views, with many struggling to break 10,000 views as recently as eight months ago. At the time of this piece’s publication, his upload covering the creator tournament has amassed 2.7 million views. Kingsman says numerous times, both in and outside of the video, that he’s a college student, and that winning the $3,000 would go a long way toward helping pay his bills.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is an insanely big deal for someone like me,” his description adds.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/marvel-rivals-kingsman-thumbnail-1769422268533.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Thumbnail for Kingsman265's Video Covering His Removal from the Deadpool Creator Cup.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The hour-and-17-minute upload is an edited recording of <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2671775299?t=05h14m38s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a livestream</a> showcasing a series of pre-tournament scrimmage matches with his team – team captain Cece, zazzastack, kayceeedilla, Fumiata, and collaborator, Luciyasa. It starts simply enough, with each player preparing by speaking about their respective competitive ranks as Kingsman asks Cece if they can “full try hard for these scrims.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I need to win this s**t. Can we do that? Please?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” she replies. “I got you.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Magik and Black Widow</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Judging by what is shown in edited clips, it seems the team gets off to a good start, winning their first match as zazzastack’s preferred character, Black Widow, nabs the MVP title. The laughs between the group quickly fade as Kingsman suggests the team switch from the theoretically balanced build of two tanks, two damage per second (DPS), and two support heroes to the current favored meta composition that includes three supports. Other teammates fire back, telling him they did not plan to utilize the meta comp during their scrimmage matches or for the tournament.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“OK, this is going to be a hard tourney then,” Kingsman says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingsman, who is seen by many to be one of the best Marvel Rivals Magik players in the world, appears to be the first to turn up the heat, arguing that other teams will almost certainly enter matches with the triple support plan because $40,000 in winnings is on the line. Others, including zazzastack, contend they shouldn’t “run a triple support with a character that I don’t know how to play.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The moment passes and tensions ease. Then, seemingly minutes later, the driving point of contention emerges when Kingsman calmly asks zazzastack if she would be interested in swapping from Black Widow’s sniper to a character with crowd control and displacement abilities like Winter Soldier. She declines, calling Black Widow her “anti-dive” pick, making it clear that she has no intention of switching from her preferred character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of hero shooters like Marvel Rivals and Overwatch are certainly aware of the weight character flexibility holds in a every match, but team chemistry can sometimes be just as important. Both elements were topics of discussion that day, as Kingsman frequently overperformed as Magik, while zazzastack’s Black Widow proved to be inconsistent.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/screenshot-2026-01-26-044108-1769424102752.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kingsman Calls Attention to zazzastack's Scoreboard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, players use scoreboards in hero shooters as a measurement of performance, but these tools rarely tell the full story and don’t account for things like time on point or game-changing plays. Still, they can be used to detect symptoms of broader issues. One specific round's scoreboard circulating online saw Magik carrying eliminations with 18 kills, one assist, and two deaths, while Black Widow secured zero kills, zero assists, and five deaths. It’s also worth noting that zazzastack had a notably higher ping than her teammates, often reaching numbers as high as 170ms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Kingsman persisted, the tense back and forth about strategy and philosophy eventually took a turn for the worse. The video shows multiple members of the team siding against Kingsman, with players like Cece and Luciyasa becoming two of the more vocal individuals coming to zazzastack’s defense. What many online take issue with is the tone and insults that followed, even as Kingsman offers to switch to other characters to support a new team comp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That’s such a good point,” Cece replies with a sarcastic tone. “You’re so right about that – and we’re still going to play Widow.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m just here to accept that Kingsman is a meta slave,” she jabs again shortly after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Insults and calls to “shut the f**k up” are lobbed at Kingsman as arguments progress in the video, with clips showing instances of Cece calling him a “loser” in-between matches on her own stream emerging later. One match that takes place later in Kingsman’s video sees the team calmly walk away with a narrow win, with everyone performing relatively well. Just as the “Victory” card slides across the screen, a voice can be heard, saying, “talk s**t to Kingsman now, zazza.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This whole Kingsman situation on Marvel Rivals has gone insanely viral. </p><p>I’ve seen clips of it and posts about it on literally every social media platform, even posts about it from people I KNOW don’t play video games or keep up with them 😅 <a href="https://t.co/ZkH84XqJ8X" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ZkH84XqJ8X</a></p></div>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/2014338091406762292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 22, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Moments later and more than an hour into tournament prep, Kingsman departs, saying he’s going to go queue ranked games, separate from his team. Cece leaves to take an “urgent” call from BasimZB, the team goes their separate ways, and Kingsman shares a few words with his viewers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m just here to win the tournament, you know? I need that money,” he says. “I’m f**king broke. I like money, and $40,000, which has a prize pool for first place of three grand, is a lot of money for me. I could really use that to help pay my college.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BasimZB later sends Kingsman a message, telling him he has been kicked from the tournament without warning. Cece was banned on Twitch – and thus kicked from the tournament – shortly after for a separate incident that she has since said is related to her “saying something toxic to my friend in chat,” violating the streaming site’s terms of service.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Overtime</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingsman and Cece’s former teammates went on to participate in the tournament and landed in seventh place out of eight teams. All of the major players in the story have since released separate videos and social media statements in an attempt to clear confusion and share their sides of the story, with everyone calling on their fans to not harass anyone else involved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cece’s <a href="https://youtu.be/9CbSUZZTOzw?si=gipP6sXodZhagy1b" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>immediate video response</u></a> alleges BasimZB kicked Kingsman solely because of his tone, which she says was “making the team uncomfortable” and potentially impacting team performance. She says she had little involvement in Kingsman’s removal from the tournament, sharing messages with BasimZB where he says he saw clips of Kingsman “saying disrespectful things while muted” and “saying disrespectful things about the tournament.” She adds, “in hindsight, maybe [Kingsman] should have gotten a warning.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cece, who has received a barrage of harassment online following the Deadpool Creator Cup, also took to X/Twitter to respond to questions about her behavior, addressing comments she made both during and <a href="https://x.com/cecefps/status/2013494203263676474?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>after</u></a> the initial incident. <a href="https://x.com/cecefps/status/2013478943001550861?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>One more recent post</u></a> issued to her followers sees her explaining the reasoning for her actions and apologizing to Kingsman for some of her words, including calling him a “loser,” both on her stream and her follow-up video.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m sorry I failed to realize that I need to take proper accountability on here as well. Many of you saw my replies and they were defensive, deflecting, and argumentative. I was busy fighting to defend myself and I’ve deleted them now because I realized what you guys really…</p>— Cece (@cecefps) <a href="https://twitter.com/cecefps/status/2013478943001550861?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 20, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Emotions were high and I failed to notice which resulted in me snapping at Kingsman,” Cece says. “I apologize as no matter what, raising voices and instantly shutting down a teammate is not the right thing to do. I also should have reprimanded the comments directed at Kingsman once the scrims were over. I needed to hold everyone accountable.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BasimZB initially stood by his decision to kick Kingsman but eventually reversed course after watching the entire series of scrimmages. He has since apologized to Kingsman, saying that he has <a href="https://x.com/BasimZB/status/2014790404621668379?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>already spoken to him</u></a> and that he “<a href="https://x.com/BasimZB/status/2014463815618806088?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>def got played by a lot of people</u></a>.” He has also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1qis95f/oneman_marvel_rivals_to_speaks_on_being_lied_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented on</u></a> the “hate” he’s received from users criticizing his handling of the Marvel Rivals tournament, saying, “the people who come in here, when they hate, they are justified in what they’re saying.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luciyasa, who has been known to collaborate and “duo” with Kingsman in the past, has also faced criticism for her role during the scrimmage matches and for comments she made later. She has <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/luciyasa/clip/EasyStylishGarlicFUNgineer-DAM3iKvmlf6ccFTj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>clarified</u></a> that some of her words were said “at wrong times,” though she stands by telling Kingsman to “shut the f**k up” because of how it was affecting zazzastacks. While it’s unclear if she has spoken with her former Marvel Rivals partner, she has <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/luciyasa/clip/TawdryStrongKiwiOneHand-GGkFVYGYtgjTIiA4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>expressed interest in speaking with him offline</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zazzastack has also been bashed online despite saying relatively little during the confrontation with Kingsman. In <a href="https://x.com/zazzastack/status/2013980528131858927?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>her follow-up post</u></a>, she apologizes for shifting to a “stern” tone after he continued to push her to switch characters, adding that she is “taking accountability for not swapping off Widow when I should have.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was never once rude to Kingsman in the VODs (video on demand) even when asked to talk my s**t,” zazzastacks said. “I will take accountability for getting stern after a while of being asked the same question over and over and do apologise for that as I definitely could’ve had more patience, however I still don’t believe that I insulted him in any way. If Kingsman is at all offended by any of my actions then I am deeply sorry to him.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kingsman</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingsman eventually <a href="https://x.com/Kingsman265MR/status/2014061233436029104?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared a document</a> containing direct messages between he and Cece called "The Cece Files." It covers a conversation between the two feuding creators that took place after the scrimmage matches and after Kingsman had uploaded his video.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He appears to have hoped to maintain a competitive attitude upon learning of how it could help pay for his education but only wound up removed from the tournament without a dime to show for it. That’s the story the internet has rallied behind, and the result is far, far more than $3,000 for the Magik player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingsman’s latest YouTube video hitting nearly 3 million views may earn him a bit of cash, for example. In addition to what appears to be a growth of <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kingsman265_twitch/clip/ConsideratePerfectAlfalfaDeIlluminati--GGr_p1fVwLzITWM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>hundreds of thousands of subscribers</u></a> on the Google video platform, he has seen an increase of more than 220,000 followers (up from 1,000 January 16) as his average viewers skyrockets (via <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/kingsman265_twitch/statistics" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TwitchTracker</u></a>). Kingsman has also seen a drastic increase in subscribers and audience donations, as he also <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kingsman265_twitch/clip/MoistAttractiveWrenPRChase-cLbRJGnzHZzdYT2U" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>alleges</u></a> that one anonymous donor outright paid him the $3,000 he had hoped to earn in winnings.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Kingsman265 was gifted in-game units to purchase premium skins. <br>W dev team <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MarvelRivals</a> <a href="https://t.co/3eC0znyu6X" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3eC0znyu6X</a></p>— Trending Now ON X (@TrendingNowVidz) <a href="https://twitter.com/TrendingNowVidz/status/2014347107969150976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 22, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">We can't tell just how much money he has made in the aftermath of his removal from the Deadpool Creator Cup, but as viewers head to comment sections across the internet to offer their support, it’s safe to say he’s got at least a little more cash to help pay for college. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kingsman265_twitch/clip/StupidFantasticWormDeIlluminati-sDiCob4O4MF7ZmRA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kingsman says</u></a> the Marvel Rivals team at NetEase has also stepped in, gifting him in-game credits known as Units to, as he says, “purchase Magik skins.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NBA team the Atlanta Hawks got in on the drama, too, showing their support for the competitive gamer with <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@atlhawks/video/7597624736583011598?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post on TikTok</u></a>. Even Straight Outta Compton star and son of Ice Cube, O’Shea Jackson Jr., commented on the events of the last few weeks, simply sending out <a href="https://x.com/OsheaJacksonJr/status/2014126685327937667?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post mentioning his name</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>kingsman went live and just made more than 3K in literally 5 minutes of the stream.</p><p>I still have faith in the world <a href="https://t.co/1hafMLb3in" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1hafMLb3in</a></p></div>— SN | Avataryaya (@avataryaya_) <a href="https://twitter.com/avataryaya_/status/2013800816918864160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 21, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Kingsman265 drama began as the kind of argument hero shooter players find themselves in every day and transformed into what could remain as the biggest gaming drama of the year. For now, it appears every name involved will continue playing, streaming, and competing in Marvel Rivals events, regardless of the sides they took. Kingsman didn’t come close to winning the Deadpool Creator Cup, and it doesn’t like he would have if he hadn’t have been kicked, but at this stage of the drama, it seems the internet is doing its best to put him on top.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was looking through my old clips, and I found a video of myself being like, ‘I’ve only ever made $90 from Twitch in four years of streaming, but I’m going to keep streaming anyway,’ and… holy s**t,” Kingsman <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kingsman265_twitch/clip/AwkwardHedonisticKeyboardCurseLit-01aD3MWnbeym8APG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said during a recent stream</u></a> as his livestream chat asks him to turn on ads. “You guys really want ads? OK, bro.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“How do I even turn on ads? I literally don’t know,” he adds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.
