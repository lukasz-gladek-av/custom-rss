This marks the first championship dedicated to the game’s Warfare mode, where teams from around the world will battle it out in 20 vs 20 warfare for a share of a $200,000 USD prize pool. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Team Jade has emphasised that this year is only the beginning, with the aim to grow Delta Force into a globally recognised esports title. In September, the Delta Force Operations Invitational put the extraction format in the spotlight, with Chinese powerhouse team Q9 emerging victorious. Now, the competitive scene shifts its focus to the high-stakes Warfare mode, where fans can expect a large-scale epic showdown. </p><h2 data-cy="title1"><strong>Dates &amp; Format</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Invitational will see teams compete in Warfare mode across four days of top-level competition.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warfare mode in Delta Force is a large-scale, team-based PvP experience focused on capturing or defending objectives across expansive maps. It features combined-arms combat with infantry, vehicles like tanks and helicopters, and distinct operator classes that encourage teamwork and strategic roles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tournament will run on a double-elimination playoff, meaning an initial loss doesn’t end a team’s run. Instead, it pushes them into a lower bracket with the chance to fight back. The top teams from each bracket will then proceed to the Grand Final. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>December 11th – 13th:</strong> Playoffs </li><li><strong>December 14th:</strong> Winners and Losers Bracket Finals, Halftime Show, and Grand Final</li></ul><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/schedule-bracket-1764761526680.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title1"><strong>Teams Competing </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Teams earned their spots through a mixture of regional qualifiers and standalone tournaments, which served as an official path into the global finals.
