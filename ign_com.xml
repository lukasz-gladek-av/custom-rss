No one seems to know. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hqvdjy/12k_players_again/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artifact community isn't reporting any sudden spikes in interest</a>, and no one's really talking about the game on social media apart from marveling at the sudden jump in player numbers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So why, then, is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/583950/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a> suggesting that a free-to-play card game that is, by all accounts, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/artifact-valve-stops-development-on-struggling-card-game">close to dead</a>, seeing wild spikes in users over very specific two-day periods?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2025/01/01/12000-people-are-playing-artifact-right-now-and-no-one-knows-why/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by Forbes</a>, Artifact Classic's (the original, now free-to-play version of Artifact) player count suddenly spiked on December 31, jumping from a measly ~200 concurrent players up to the 5,000s, before spiking to a height of over 12,000. Artifact remained at around 11,000 concurrents through the second, before its playercount absolutely tanked back down to ~150 at midnight on January 3rd. What's strange is that something almost exactly like this happened earlier this month, too: on December 14, player counts shot up to around 14,000, hung out there for about two days, and dive bombed again into the hundreds on the 17th.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what's really going on here? The actual answer is that no one <em>really </em>knows. The most prevalent community theory seems to be that it's bots, though why someone would train bots to play Artifact isn't exactly clear. One person suggested someone was training an AI to play the game "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hf87nf/comment/m2agrbz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for shits and giggles</a>" which is perhaps as good an explanation as any. Another person suggested the spikes were due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hqvdjy/comment/m4y3g74/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scam bots increasing playtime in random games</a> in order to make their Steam accounts look legitimate for <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/70E6-991B-233B-A37B" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other purposes</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Hero in Artifact's Call to Arms Release Set</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another theory pointed out by multiple members of the Artifact subreddit is that the spike in players is due to pirates. Because certain video games require Steam authentication, in order to pirate those games, pirates will use the AppID/SDK of a different, free-to-play game to fool Steam into thinking they have a real copy. In this case, it's being suggested they're using Artifact. That said, this theory doesn't entirely hold up, due to the extremely sudden spikes and then drops in activity at very precise times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the actual answer behind Artifact's mysterious player numbers remains a mystery for now. We did reach out to Valve for comment, but did not hear back in time for publication. What is clear at least is that despite the numbers, Artifact itself doesn't seem to be garnering any meaningful, real-world interest eight years after launch and four years after Valve <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/artifact-valve-stops-development-on-struggling-card-game">effectively called it quits</a>, even though the game itself <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/13/artifact-review">was pretty fun at first</a>. At least the bots, if they are indeed bots, in Artifact don't seem to be bothering legitimate players, unlike <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/team-fortress-2-steam-reviews-drop-to-mostly-negative-as-players-plead-with-valve-to-do-something-about-bots">the on-and-off situation over in Team Fortress 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
