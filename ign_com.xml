We've rounded up our picks for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals-black-friday-2024">the best Black Friday/Cyber Monday Xbox deals already</a>, but one of our favorites that is already live is the Xbox Series S for $248.

Both the controller and console come in Roboto White, giving a clean look to any setup. The Xbox Series S only includes 512GB of storage, with just 364GB available for games. The rest of the storage is taken up by the OS and for features like Quick Resume. If you're looking for more space, we'd suggest grabbing an SSD – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-expansion-card-best-buy-black-friday-2024">this 1TB WD Black storage card is at its lowest price of the year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox has multiple major games on the horizon, making now a perfect time to hop in and score an Xbox Series S at a discount. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-final-preview">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is due out next week, and Obsidian Entertainment's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-the-final-preview">Avowed</a> is set to launch in February. At $248, this isn't a ground-breaking low price, but it's enough of a discount to justify picking up the Xbox Series S if you don't own an Xbox or PC. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Looking for More Cyber Monday Gaming Deals?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're searching for the best deals out there this Black Friday, some of the biggest consoles, accessories, bundles and video games are on sale, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">FFVII Rebirth</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-review">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">Astro Bot</a>, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

Especially when it comes to first-party Nintendo titles like Zelda and Mario, you often see games sticking with an above $40 price tag years and years after their release. That's why this deals season, the number one thing I had my eye on was price drops on Switch games, and for the first time (maybe ever), Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals have exceeded my expectations. While the Nintendo eShop has its own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-black-friday-digital-video-game-sale-live">digital game sale</a> underway, some of the best Switch games have their lowest prices ever at select retailers like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-black-friday-sales-2024">Best Buy</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamestop-black-friday-sale-2024">GameStop</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-target-black-friday-sales">Target</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-walmart-black-friday-deals-2024">Walmart</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With major price cuts to games that typically cost upwards of $50 (looking at you, Zelda), these <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cyber-monday-deals-2024">Cyber Monday deals</a> aren't getting any better. We’re here to help you find the best picks for Nintendo's handheld while holiday shopping on a budget.
