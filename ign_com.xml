Gears of War?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has solidified its plans for June, confirming an Xbox Games Showcase 2025 as well as an The Outer Worlds 2 Direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft normally hosts a June showcase to reveal upcoming Xbox games, and 2025 is no different.  Xbox Games Showcase 2025 will be livestreamed on Sunday, June 8, starting at 10am Pacific / 1pm Eastern / 6pm UK time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox Games Showcase 2025 will offer a look at upcoming titles from across Microsoft’s first-party studios, Microsoft said, “in addition to incredible new titles from our third-party partners across the globe.”</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what could Microsoft have up its sleeve? It has a long list of games in development, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fable-delayed-to-2026-microsoft-reveals-brand-new-pre-alpha-gameplay">the new Fable, which was recently delayed to 2026</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/perfect-dark-reboot">Perfect Dark reboot</a>, inXile’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clockwork-revolution">Clockwork Revolution</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/contraband">Contraband</a>, from the developer of the Just Cause series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-issues-update-on-rares-long-in-development-everwild">Rare's Everwild, which Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer recently checked out</a>, The Coalition's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/od-a-hideo-kojima-game">Hideo Kojima’s OD</a>, and Undead Labs' <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/state-of-decay-3">State of Decay 3</a>. Psychonauts developer Double Fine is also working on a new game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the Activision Blizzard side of things, there will of course be a new Call of Duty game later this year, and various releases from Blizzard itself. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> launches in July, so that may make the cut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Bethesda, could it finally be time to find out what’s next for Starfield? We are, after all, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-logo-pops-up-on-work-in-progress-starfield-creation-sparking-ps5-release-speculation">still waiting for that PlayStation 5 release date confirmation</a>. Could we get a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there’s always the potential for Microsoft to reveal new Xbox hardware. It is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/full-next-gen-xbox-reportedly-set-for-2027-xbox-branded-gaming-handheld-due-out-later-in-2025">reportedly set to release a next-gen Xbox console as well as an Xbox handheld at some point in 2027</a>, so this year’s showcase may be too early to find out more. But Microsoft may take the opportunity to touch on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-teased-by-asus">Xbox-branded handhelds from third-party companies</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And following in the footsteps of the 2023 Starfield Direct and 2024 Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct, this year Microsoft will follow its Xbox Games Showcase by The Outer Worlds 2 Direct. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> is from Obsidian, which is fresh from the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>. The direct “will bring you inside the walls of Obsidian Entertainment, revealing new gameplay, details, and developer insights, straight from the people making the sequel to the award-winning, first-person sci-fi RPG.” The Outer Worlds 2 is expected out later in 2025, so it seems likely we'll get a release date during the showcase.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Airtime for the Xbox Games Showcase followed by The Outer Worlds 2 Direct in local time zones:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>PDT: June 8, 10am     </li><li>EDT: June 8, 1pm     </li><li>BST: June 8, 6pm  </li><li>CET: June 8, 7pm   </li><li>JST: June 9, 2am </li><li>AEST: June 9, 3am </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft said the Xbox Games Showcase and The Outer Worlds 2 Direct will be digital-only, which means there’s no theatre experience for fans and media this year. But it promised that its livestream will bring fans “everything you’ll need to know about what’s next for Xbox, no matter where in the world you’re watching.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
