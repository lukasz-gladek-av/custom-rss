Nintendo did not share an updated kick-off date, but did promise that the June 5, 2025 release date of the Switch 2 itself remains intact.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo issued IGN the following statement:</p><blockquote>Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has confirmed the pre-order delay is specific to the U.S. In the UK, for example, Nintendo's pre-order delay remains unchanged.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-price-confirmed">Nintendo announced the Switch 2 at $449.99</a>, with a Mario Kart World bundle priced $499.99. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-costs-80-30-cheaper-if-you-buy-it-bundled-with-the-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World itself is priced $79.99</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch 2 comes with the following:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nintendo Switch 2 console</li><li>Joy-Con 2 controllers (L+R)</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Grip</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Straps</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Dock</li><li>Ultra High-Speed HDMI Cable</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter</li><li>USB-C Charging Cable</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s statement issued today raises the prospect that it could hike the price of the Switch 2 and its games further amid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-nintendo-pr-managers-say-switch-2-and-mario-kart-world-price-backlash-a-true-crisis-moment-for-nintendo">what is already an angry backlash to its next-gen pricing strategy</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking in <a href="https://youtu.be/jMibVyYvSYU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a video on their YouTube channel</a>, former Nintendo of America PR managers Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang criticized Nintendo for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-price-confirmed">the way it revealed the $449.99 price of the Switch 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-costs-80-30-cheaper-if-you-buy-it-bundled-with-the-nintendo-switch-2">the $79.99 price of Mario Kart World</a> following this week's Nintendo Direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t want to blow things out of proportion, but this does feel like a true crisis moment for Nintendo,” Ellis said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">U.S. markets tumbled today after China hit back against Donald Trump's raft of tariffs. China, which faces a 54% import tax, has retaliated with an additional 34% tax on U.S. goods from next week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moments before the U.S. markets opened, Trump said "China played it wrong, they panicked," and insisted his policies would "never change."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The world is now left facing economic uncertainty, with some mainstream news media declaring the era of cheap goods now over for the American consumer as higher tariffs are automatically passed through to inflation and higher prices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tariffs are essentially taxes placed on the cost of importing certain goods. While it's possible for companies in the supply chain to simply eat these costs, more often than not these taxes are passed onto consumers. And unfortunately for gamers, rising prices are very likely to impact tech and gaming goods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-take-on-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad had warned</a> that Trump's surprise tariffs on countries such as Vietnam, where Nintendo had shifted some of its Switch 2 manufacturing in anticipation of U.S. tariffs on China, might have caused a rethink.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset U.S. tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the Switch 2 showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world," Ahmad said. "The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced"><u>everything announced at the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive"><u>what the experts have to say about the Switch 2 price and Mario Kart World’s $80 price tag</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The partnership with Nintendo seemed to affect not just the style of game FromSoft is making, but even the design of the keeper of The Duskbloods' hub area into something different — something... cute.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer shown during the Switch 2 Direct this week closed on a shot of a winged rat character, with glowing glyphs drawn all over it, looking at the camera. Curious fans might have wondered what this rat's deal was. As it turns out, this is our new hub companion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That character shares a similar role with the fire keepers from the Dark Souls series. They remain in the hub area, providing the player with advice and guidance," director Hidetaka Miyazaki said <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-3/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview with Nintendo</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I suppose you could say we tried doing something a little Nintendo-esque in the spirit of the partnership."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked what Miyazaki means by that, he added: "We tried something cute for a change. Although I will say this character is actually an elderly gentleman (laughter)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FromSoftware's shrine keepers have been central figures for player's journeys through their worlds. Familiar faces like Melina, the Maiden in Black, the Doll, and others are characters you return to over and over on your trip, often offering power to help you move forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a PvPvE game like The Duskbloods, though, it remains to be seen what kind of advice and guidance the winged rat will offer. Miyazaki said the team at FromSoft has tried its hands at introducing "a lot of new and interesting ideas," so expect the unexpected when it hits Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got plenty more on The Duskbloods, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-fans-react-to-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods">Bloodborne fan reaction</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-director-miyazaki-reassures-fans-that-fromsoftware-will-still-actively-develop-single-player-focused-games-despite-online-multiplayer-the-duskbloods">Miyazaki's comments on whether FromSoft plans to leave single-player behind</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, if you're looking for more Switch 2 news, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-played-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">check out our first hands-on with Nintendo's newest console</a>, its big launch title <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">Mario Kart World</a>, and the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-first-hands-on-preview">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's a PvPvE game developed by the Soulsborne studio, but director Hidetaka Miyazaki said this doesn't mean the company has shifted direction moving forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new interview with Nintendo</a>, Miyazaki spoke about the decision to make The Duskbloods a PvPvE game. The director said he's "always found" the structure interesting, as it allows for a broad range of game-design ideas while also letting FromSoftware leverage its experience in designing challenging enemy encounters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As a side note, please allow me to address one thing," Miyazaki said. "As we previously mentioned, this is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn't mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: "The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Elden Ring was also announced, and we still intend to actively develop single-player focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the release of Elden Ring in February 2022, FromSoftware has certainly experimented a bit. Its DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, tried out some interesting new power scaling methods <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-scadutree-blessings-are-the-answer-to-elden-ring-dlcs-difficulty">in the form of Scadutree Blessings</a>. There's also Elden Ring: Nightreign, an upcoming co-op survival action game that blends the usual Souls style with an encroaching storm, loot, and character archetypes. The studio even went back to its mecha days with Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So with The Duskbloods, FromSoftware is trying something a little different again. In the interview, Miyazaki said the company's outline for The Duskbloods was "still very bare-bones" when the team presented it to Nintendo — "more a loose string of ideas than a proper presentation," and the concept was "different from anything [FromSoftware] had done before." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo was interested in making it happen though, and while a small team started the project for the original Switch, Nintendo approached FromSoft with the idea of moving to the Switch 2 instead. "The new hardware's focus on online features allowed us to stay as true to the original vision as possible, which was very good news for us," Miyazaki said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So while The Duskbloods might be a little different from the usual FromSoftware game, it sounds like the studio isn't completely leaving the "traditional" style you'd expect behind. Put differently: let FromSoft cook on this one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what could FromSoft's next single-player focused game be? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-2-not-being-considered-at-fromsoftware-hidetaka-miyazaki-says">Miyazaki has said the developer is not currently considering making Elden Ring 2</a>, but late last year left the door open to the possibility in the future. It's probably not <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-fans-react-to-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods">Bloodborne 2</a>, either, much to the frustration of fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on the Nintendo Switch 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">check out our round-up of everything announced at the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> this week, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive">read over our recent chat with analysts about the sticker-shock of both the Switch 2 console and some of its games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
