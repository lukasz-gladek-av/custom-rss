            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gearbox-says-take-two-does-not-use-spyware-in-its-games-as-borderlands-review-bombing-continues<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox Software has published a statement regarding the controversy surrounding changes to parent company Take-Two’s Terms of Service and fears that many Borderlands games now contain “spyware.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Published <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/49520/discussions/0/598528766295202095/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>directly on Steam</u></a>, where outcry has materialized in the form of review-bombing campaigns for all major Borderlands titles, the statement’s aim is to address concerns while “maintaining transparency and confidence with the community.” That means tackling two key talking points that have taken over the Borderlands fanbase for months, including fears of spyware and modding crackdowns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox makes its stance clear from the get-go: “Take-Two does not use spyware in its games.” While there are instances data will be collected, Gearbox doesn’t want players to fear that their private information is always up for grabs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Take-Two identifies these practices in its Privacy Policy to provide transparency to players and comply with its legal obligations,” Gearbox’s Steam statement says. “Take-Two collects this information to deliver its services to players, including to protect the game environment and player experience. You can read more about this in the Privacy Policy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement continues: “For example, player and device identifiers are collected in part to ensure the game is compatible with each player’s media, platform or website browser type. It allows us to better understand how players play games, and to personalize the user experience (like having usernames show up!). Account credentials are collected from users who choose to create accounts with Take-Two and its labels.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear if Gearbox’s explanation of Take-Two’s Terms of Service will be enough to calm those who took up arms after the agreement was altered back in February. Meanwhile, the studio’s explanation for its stance on the modding scene is fairly straightforward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Take-Two’s Terms of Service prohibit mods that allow users to gain an unfair advantage, negatively impact the ability of other users to enjoy the game as intended, or allow users to gain access to content that the user is not entitled to,” the statement clarifies. “We do this to protect the integrity of the game experience for all users.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a direct response to fears that the modding community could face repercussions for any kind of modding activity, as Gearbox says Take-Two’s primary concern lies with cheaters who could dampen the experience for other players. The statement goes as far as to say Gearbox’s parent company “generally does not seek to take action against mods that are single-player only, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property (IP) rights of its labels and third parties.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Uproar began around May of this year when fans caught wind that Take-Two had updated its terms of service, affecting many of its existing titles. Rumor that the company was preying on user data quickly caught fire, resulting in a movement that saw the Recent Reviews sections for Borderlands 1, Borderlands 2, and Borderlands 3 tank into the “Mostly Negative” and “Overwhelmingly Negative” zones. While concerns subsided for the back half of May, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-2-goes-free-to-keep-on-steam-where-recent-eula-changes-have-sparked-a-mostly-negative-user-review-rating-across-the-entire-franchise"><u>fears kicked up once again when Borderlands 2 was made free to keep</u></a> (for a limited time) on June 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, the Borderlands series’ Recent Reviews on Steam remain firmly in the red. Meanwhile, Gearbox is working to deliver <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4"><u>Borderlands 4</u></a> this September.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-cast-premieres-the-first-10-minutes-of-the-games-documentary-at-ign-live-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Get a behind-the-scenes look at the game that's taking the world by storm.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The cast of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 stopped by IGN Live to not only discuss the beloved new game from Sandfall Interactive, but also to exclusively premiere an over 10-minute look at the game's making-of documentary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The exclusive clip, which you can see below, begins by putting the focus on the developers of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 on the day before launch. It then takes viewers behind the scenes of motion capture performances, including how that emotional opening scene between Gustave and Sophie came to life and another fun moment between Monoco and Verso.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the documentary is still a work in progress and the full video may change, we were able to chat with Jennifer English (Maelle), Ben Starr (Verso), Shala Nyx (Sciel), Kirsty Rider (Lune), Rich Keeble (Monoco), and Maxence Cazorla (Esquie) about their work on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were all really excited," English said of the time before the game launched. "We weren’t as stressed as the developers were, but I was dead nervous about it because we put all our love and heart into it and hope it pays off - and thankfully it did."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You can do whatever you do in the studio, but then it stops being yours," Starr added. "You don’t know what it’s going to become. There are so many circumstances that go into the release of a game, and I felt, personally, there was a huge amount of pressure. It’s a game I wanted to be good for the team because they had put so much work into it, and because we didn’t just come into it, we were an additional part of it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">English then went on to discuss what it was like recording for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and video games in general, and it was a fascinating glimpse behind the curtain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I get so lonely in the booth," English joked. "You have to pretend. It’s very rare in video games that you get a playmate. I think it’s happened once or twice that I’ve had another actor in the room, so it’s a real honor when people think you were together recording. Video game acting is the Olympics of acting. If you can do good acting in video games - there is some bad acting, but not in this game – you can do anything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nyx then shared how many people have reached out to her about how her character, Sciel, has helped them with struggles in their own lives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s so cinematic," Nyx said. "It’s just so wonderful to be the voice and body of a character that is so rich and has so much emotional depth. I’ve had so many people reach out to me about how my character has helped them with their depression and helped them with their mental health. It’s so ephemeral and every moment is so rich and that’s a testament to the writing."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, Starr spoke on the emotional impact of the game and why we care so much about these pixels that became characters that mean a lot to us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason you cry is because there is so much joy to be lost," Starr said. "You can’t have something that’s just morose all the time. If these people who are so vibrantly brought to life by these actors, if we lose them, then you lose everything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sells-33-million-in-33-days-not-bad-for-a-game-some-thought-was-going-to-get-crushed-by-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">how the game sold 3.3 million copies in just 33 days.</a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sea-of-remnants-is-looking-like-the-creepy-puppet-pirate-game-to-watch-in-2026-ign-live-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">You might have seen an RPG with a swashbuckling theme before, but guaranteed you haven't seen one that looks like Joker Studio's Sea of Remnants. Think of a haunted toy box belonging to a deranged puppeteer, and then add a bit of glam rock for good measure. It's the perfect vibe for the story of a sailor with no memories setting out to find a cursed location, and the adventure will arrive on PC and mobile in 2026. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our creative journey began with a spark of pure feeling—an emotional image that guided everything: 'If a puppet’s mind is soaked in water, memories slip away into the ocean, yet they still choose to return and sail again.' This early inspiration was both a playful nod to the Chinese saying “ 脑子进水” ('brain soaked with water') and a philosophical reflection seen in some of our favorite films," Joker Studios told us. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When it came time to build the actual framework, we drew on a wide range of influences—from JRPGs and CRPGs to open-world titles and even niche indie games that share a spirit of boundless exploration. At every step, we focused on how to let players experience these feelings themselves, not just watch them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you dive into Sea of Remnants you'll be focused on exploring the pirate city Orbtopia, talking to the rich cast of NPCs and - you're a sailor after all -  taking to the briny waves to find islands, treasures, and hidden ruins. You can raid the ships you meet on the sea or take on huge monsters, all while a dynamic weather system rages overhead. When you're not doing that you'll be focused on upgrading your vessel, learning new skills, or even kicking back with some fishing, cooking, and mahjong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You’ll challenge sea monsters, explore local cultures, and sense the deeper mystery of how memory and forgetting begin to intertwine between the ocean and Orbtopia, the pirate haven. Alongside your companions, you’ll begin a journey that’s equal parts unrestrained and romantic, charting a course as unique as each sailor who steps aboard," says Joker Studio. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Joker Studio previously released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/identity-v"><u>Identity V</u></a>, a survival horror game created in partnership with Dead by Daylight's Behavior Interactive. Since its release in 2018, Identity V has collaborated with Edward Scissorhands, Sherlock Holmes, Personae and Deathnote. Just like Sea of Remnants it has a distinctive visual style - think Coraline but creepier. The game made a bigger impact in Asia than the US, but it still has a dedicated fandom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At their core, the two games exist in entirely separate worlds and storylines. That said, as a nod to fans and our shared studio DNA, you might find a few subtle Easter eggs or world-building hints here and there. But rest assured, any connections are handled with great care and won’t overshadow the unique stories of each game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN Live 2025 is packed with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-2025-partners-announced">exclusive reveals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-2025-to-give-away-more-than-20000-prizes-and-freebies">thousands of giveaways</a>, 170 gaming stations, and tons of fun, the event is shaping up to be a huge celebration of everything fans of games, TV, movies, comics, and collectibles love, and here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-2025-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect">how to watch</a> the event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial. She's been a professional nerd since 2006 when she got her start on Official PlayStation Magazine in the UK, and has since worked for GamesIndustry.Biz, Rolling Stone and GamesRadar.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/superman-arrives-in-fortnite-battle-royale-during-star-wars-live-event-as-death-star-detonates-and-destruction-rains-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has just wrapped up its latest explosive live event, detonating the Death Star looming over the Island and welcoming DC Comics hero Superman in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tonight's event, Death Star Sabotage, saw nearly 6 million players infiltrate the Empire's fully operational battle station that has hovered menacingly over the Fortnite battle royale Island throughout its Star Wars mini-season. Happily, and perhaps unsurprisingly, players were able to stop the station's deadly space laser from obliterating the game's map — although not without causing a bit of damage in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As destruction rained down, the event's closing moments saw Superman arrive — presumably to try and help with clean up duties during the game's incoming superhero-themed season, which begins in just a few hours' time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite's big Star Wars event began in orbit around the game's battle royale Island, giving players a rare glimpse at the game's setting from outside its usual boundaries. Fortnite's setting exists as a bubble of reality floating through the multiverse (which handily allows any character from any franchise to turn up at any time!) and here, players were able to pilot X-Wings and TIE-Fighters to blow up orbiting Star Destroyers and engage in fun dogfights. In the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes">continued absence of a Star Wars: Battlefront 3</a>, this was a fun riff on its space battles to get things started.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The action then swiftly moved to within the Death Star itself, as Fortnite heroes Jonesy (Troy Baker) and Hope (Suzie Yeung) led players through the bowels of the station, initially disguised as Stormtroopers and their captives. Ultimately, players found themselves in an encounter with Star Wars' Emperor (was that the voice of Sheev Palpatine himself, Ian McDiarmid?), and able to escape the Death Star as it exploded.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/07/0defa510-26bf-45aa-835e-6c50e905e524-1-1749324031249.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Star Wars: Battlefront eat your heart out.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a nod to Fortnite's 2021 live event Operation Sky Fire (which also ended in a space station exploding above the game's Island), players were initially left to celebrate their victory — until the realisation that huge flaming chunks of said space station were now raining down on their battle royale home. And here, one of these chunks smashed straight into the glowing Rift Gate used to access the spirit realm by Fortnite's current antihero Daigo, unleashing its untold power. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event's final moments see players back on the Island, mysterious energy now crackling around them. (Will this be the explanation for why superpowers now exist in the next battle royale season? Quite possibly.) Meanwhile, Superman is seen watching the Island from afar, as it is flooded by spirit realm energy. The suggestion here, of course, is that Superman will be swooping in to help.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/07/696-fortnite-death-star-sabotage-full-event-experience-00-14-22-1749324356071.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Superman watches as Fortnite's battle royale Island erupts in spirit realm energy.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite will, for the first time, follow up a major live event with a new season launch on the same day. Following the conclusion of Death Star Sabotage, Fortnite is currently in downtime, but will return with Chapter 6: Season 3 in just a few hours' time. As you might expect from Superman's arrival, this next season will indeed be superhero themed — and as eagle-eyed players have noticed, this is indeed the new version played by David Corenswet from James Gunn's upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/superman-2025">Superman</a> movie. That's some well-timed brand synergy!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While highly anticiapated, Fortnite's Star Wars season saw some of the game's lowest player numbers in some time — perhaps in response to its daring decision to remove all regular weapons (and all ammo!) and fully commit to a five-week period of Star Wars gunplay. It will be interesting to see how player numbers rebound with the launch of this new season later today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Fortnite developer Epic Games announced it would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ai-darth-vader-was-the-beginning-epic-reveals-plans-to-let-people-create-their-own-ai-npcs-in-fortnite">making Star Wars in-game assets available to creators to build their own experiences in a galaxy far, far away</a> in the not too far off future. While enjoyable, tonight's live event did feel at some points like something of a showcase for that, while including a few morsels for fans of the game's ongoing narrative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Want to watch the whole of Fortnite's Death Star Sabotage for yourself?
