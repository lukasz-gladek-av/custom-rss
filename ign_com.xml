Additionally, Ys Net claimed that such acts "may amount to trademark infringement and unfair competition" and therefore it was now preparing "appropriate measures" and exploring legal options. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Breaking News ‼️ </p><p>A trailer for Shenmue IV appears to have been leaked from Sega.

In the end, P.T. revealed itself to be a "Playable Trailer" for the secret project Silent Hills, which never came to fruition.
