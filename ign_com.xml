Set within the franchise's High Republic era, Eclipse is expected to integrate Quantic Dreams' traditional story-based gameplay with an action-adventure game set in the Star Wars universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, details on what to expect remain thin on the ground, and Quantic Dream has only commented on the project over the past few years to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/quantic-dream-responds-to-closure-fears-as-netease-insists-it-has-not-wavered-in-its-global-expansion-plans">quash rumors</a> of development trouble and delays, amid suggestions that the studio was struggling to hire staff <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/15/quantic-dream-under-fire-over-inappropriate-studio-culture">following previous workplace allegations</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Star Wars Eclipse Trailer Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Can I say it still exists?

"It's just not ready. It's simmering."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, eyebrows were raised in August 2024 when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-eclipse-from-quantic-dream-loses-lead-writer">the game's lead writer Adam Williams announced he'd left Quantic Dream after a decade at the studio</a>. As of now, there's no word on when Star Wars Eclipse will actually materialize.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Star Wars Eclipse has not been delayed because Quantic Dream never announced or promised a launch window for the title," the developer said in 2022. "Recruiting remains active as it works on Star Wars Eclipse, third-party publishing, and unannounced projects."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Whether you love it or hate it, it's undeniable how big some of the sets have been, including Final Fantasy, which ended up being <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-selling-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">the biggest launch</a> in the trading card game's long history. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-magic-the-gathering-crossover-reveal-card-spoilers">Spider-Man</a> now out of the way, and with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-set-has-been-announced-and-preorders-are-up">recently announced TMNT set</a> to look forward to in 2026 as well, our eyes now look forward to November, when the new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-aang-magic-the-gathering-cards-reveal-early-look-at-upcoming-the-last-airbender-set"><u>Avatar: The Last Airbender set</u></a> will be hitting our shelves. There's some good news for those who missed out on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-avatar-the-last-airbender-where-to-buy">initial preorder phase</a> as well, as some of the most popular products are now back in stock.</p><div catalogid="0a95b434-0851-4b80-a5b8-8aed223bf19d" id="226877"><div id="226877" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Avatar: The Last Airbender Play Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic's Avatar set is back in stock at Amazon, including the immensely popular MTG Booster Bundle. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8wwV?object_uuid=302d6385-d32f-4688-93d0-ad3b71d0c846&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>The bundle</u></a> includes nine Play Boosters, 15 foil and 15 non-foil lands, 1 spindown life counter, and a Foil promo card. Notably, while it is also available again, it's also quietly gone <em>up </em>in price. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is now listing the booster bundle for $72.99, up $3 from its original $69.99 list price. It's not a giant increase, but certainly worth mentioning as it is a little shady to see. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With these being hard to come by recently, I'm fairly sure Amazon is banking on you not noticing the change, or just straight up ignoring it, even if folk like myself find the time to point it out. Although compared to <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPV8YW?object_uuid=302d6385-d32f-4688-93d0-ad3b71d0c846&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$90 resale prices at sites like TCGPlayer</a>, $73 isn't <em>too </em>bad when it comes to markups.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, it won't be long before it disappears again, so if you're desperate to own this one come November, I'd recommend preordering ASAP to lock it in (you won't have to pay a penny until it ships anyway). </p></div><div catalogid="0a95b434-0851-4b80-a5b8-8aed223bf19d" id="226876"><div id="226876" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Avatar: The Last Airbender Play Booster Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QbbBB6?object_uuid=302d6385-d32f-4688-93d0-ad3b71d0c846&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Play Boosters boxes have also recently returned</u></a> at Amazon. This is another one of the most popular picks for those preordering MTG x Avatar cards, so I'd snap it up ASAP to avoid missing out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once that's sorted, you're guaranteed 30 boosters to open, each containing at least 1 shiny Traditional Foil card and 1–4 cards of rarity Rare or higher, alongside the heart-racing possibility of finding special cards featuring <strong>beautiful borderless alternate art</strong>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're seeking out any of the other Avatar x MTG products, you're best bet for the cheapest prices right now are also via <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmnPPj?object_uuid=302d6385-d32f-4688-93d0-ad3b71d0c846&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9ZM1DD?object_uuid=302d6385-d32f-4688-93d0-ad3b71d0c846&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGPlayer</a>. TCGPlayer is notable for being the best, and most trustworthy, resale site online for trading card games, and that is still the case for Magic: The Gathering as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Amazon still has the Beginner Box in stock, it is currently lacking both the Scene Boxes, the Commander Bundle, and Collector Boosters. TCGPlayer is your best bet for these right now, and I'll leave a quickrun down of links and prices just below for your convenience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.
