            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The tech experts at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> have completed their analysis of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> on console, and confirmed a gradual worsening of framerate with continuous playtime, even on PlayStation 5 Pro and Xbox Series X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As revealed in <a href="https://youtu.be/kRWW6qwjFBA?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new video published to YouTube</a>, Digital Foundry found performance starts dipping after around 30 minutes to an hour, which it called "too intrusive on the overall experience, too regular an interruption." Even after a completely fresh boot, the game is still prone to framerate drops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford has acknowledged the problem on social media, promising incoming improvements. As a workaround, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-performance-gets-worse-the-longer-you-play-on-console-randy-pitchford-suggests-quitting-the-game-and-restarting-as-a-workaround">Pitchford suggested console players quit Borderlands 4 and restart</a>. Digital Foundry’s Tom Morgan confirmed this does restore performance, but criticized the situation, saying “resetting the game every hour should really not be an expected solution for players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Each console is prone to sizeable, sub-60fps lurches given enough time on the clock, and it's just a matter of how long you're willing to keep playing before deciding to reset," Morgan added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Morgan also called for an emergency patch. Gearbox has promised more fixes are on the way, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-september-18-update-improves-stability-on-pc-and-smooths-out-progression-but-according-to-the-patch-notes-balance-changes-will-have-to-wait">after yesterday’s patch tackled PC crashes</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Borderlands 4 justifies the six-year wait since the last entry with some big technical upgrades via Unreal Engine 5,” Morgan said. “Despite the team's huge ambition here, though, the game's performance at launch is struggling on console if 60fps is the goal, and a patch cannot come soon enough. The gradually worsening framerates on PS5, Pro, and Series X lead to some dire mid-30fps passages of play after a while. And resetting the game every hour should really not be an expected solution for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This lack in polish at launch also shows in its bugs where broken NPC pathfinding and flickering lighting are just a couple of issues I've experienced. The promise of Borderlands 4 is compelling, but following on from MGS Delta and Oblivion Remastered, we're once again looking at a major UE5 release with framerate issues on every format. And once again, we're having to hang tight for an update to save the day.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what's causing the problem? As Morgan points out, the situation with Borderlands 4 rekindles memories of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-camera-breaks-the-longer-you-play-and-eventually-crashes-when-loading-a-save-call-for-emergency-patch">another Unreal Engine 5 title where performance degraded over time on console and also improved with a fresh boot</a>. It's unconfirmed for now, but the leading theory for Borderlands 4, as with Oblivion, is there's some form of memory leak at play, or, as Morgan put it, "a cache of data not being flushed from system memory that eventually catches up on the player."</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What about the PC version? Borderlands 4 is currently on a mixed Steam review rating, with most of the negative comments revolving around PC performance. Digital Foundry has said its <a href="https://youtu.be/2v1ST5qMoaY?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>initial analysis of Borderlands 4 on PC</u></a> shows significant stutter problems, and have advised against running the game on its ‘Badass’ graphics setting, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-borderlands-4-on-pc-runs-worse-than-usual-for-an-unreal-engine-5-game-advise-against-badass-setting"><u>which suggests there are indeed problems with the Unreal Engine 5 title</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has said addressing PC performance is a “top priority” for the studio. In the meantime, the studio pointed to a Borderlands 4 Nvidia Optimization guide on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/679602429802577921" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>, advising players how to optimize their graphics settings for “better performance and framerates” on PC with the Nvidia app, although users report mixed results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has also issued a piece of advice to PC gamers that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-asks-pc-gamers-to-keep-playing-for-at-least-15-minutes-after-they-tweak-settings-to-see-how-performance-has-changed-as-negative-steam-reviews-pile-up"><u>to me reads like an effort to prevent players from making knee-jerk reactions to the game's performance as soon as they’ve changed their settings</u></a>: “Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile. Please keep playing for at least 15 minutes to see how your PC's performance has changed.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are on Gearbox right now amid an internet backlash to the performance of Borderlands 4 — which has come despite huge player numbers on Steam. Pitchford himself has set his sights on winning angry Borderlands 4 players over on social media. Since Borderlands 4’s huge Steam launch last week, Pitchford has issued <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/randy-pitchford-addresses-borderlands-4-console-fov-slider-complaints-theres-some-dreams-i-have-where-an-fov-setting-might-affect-fairness"><u>confusing comments on why the console version of Borderlands 4 lacks a field of view (FOV) slider</u></a>, promised <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-am-that-confident-randy-pitchford-says-its-impossible-for-borderlands-4-players-to-break-the-games-servers-this-weekend-challenges-them-to-try"><u>that it would have been impossible to break the Borderlands 4 servers through sheer weight of player numbers alone</u></a>, told people to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/code-your-own-engine-and-show-us-how-its-done-randy-pitchford-goes-on-the-offensive-as-borderlands-4-pc-performance-row-intensifies"><u>“code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please,”</u></a> and declared Borderlands 4 “a premium game made for premium gamers.” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/my-advice-to-users-is-to-accept-reality-and-tune-or-to-not-play-randy-pitchford-is-at-the-get-a-refund-from-steam-stage-of-the-borderlands-4-pc-performance-backlash"><u>He's even started telling Borderlands 4 players to refund the game on Steam if they're that upset</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">More leaked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> battle royale gameplay footage appears to have made its way online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Video of this early version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-is-getting-battle-royale-releases-chaotic-teaser-trailer"><u>the upcoming battle royale mode</u></a> poured onto X/Twitter overnight and seems to have been captured from recent BF Labs playtests hosted by the four-studio team at BF Studios. It’s a lengthy look that comes from user @BobNetworkUK, who reports that they have <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1969053836011618398" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>already managed to secure a new Labs account</u></a> after <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1969044830182383929" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>their previous account was disabled by EA</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/lrWKhc8NS0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/lrWKhc8NS0</a></p>— bob. (@BobNetworkUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1968988987684446446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The main leaked Battlefield 6 gameplay making its way around social media is relatively straightforward and not unlike what we’ve seen in other, similar battle royale experiences like Warzone. The player can be seen running around a warehouse, dodging bullets from enemy players as they collect weapons, armor plates, and other tools from nearby loot chests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other clips have also spilled onto platforms like X, including footage of how things like <a href="https://x.com/BattlPULSE/status/1969074216872890471" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>upgrade kits</u></a> and <a href="https://x.com/BF6Meta/status/1969034590879695149" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>custom weapon drops work</u></a>. It’s important to note that none of what we’ve seen so far is final.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 itself still has a few weeks to go before its October 10 release date for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S arrives. BF Studios hasn’t officially announced when exactly the Battlefield 6 battle royale mode will launch, though <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1968006588784058548" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ModernWarzone</u></a> reported earlier this week that its sources expect its release date to be October 28, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and BF Studios are no strangers to leaks, especially when it comes to Battlefield 6. That’s mostly thanks to BF Labs, which has allowed a large number of players to experience in-development content as the developers look for fan feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a topic we made sure to ask Ripple Effect about when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042"><u>interviewing the team</u></a> earlier this month. Most gamers have known that Battlefield 6 is under pressure to deliver for EA. BF Studios told us it knows next month’s new entry marks a particularly important moment for the long-running FPS franchise, too, which is why <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-will-leak-everything-battlefield-6-devs-insist-they-didnt-want-the-game-to-suffer-from-leaks-but-getting-player-feedback-had-to-come-at-any-cost"><u>it doubled down on fan feedback – even if it means it’s sprung a few leaks along the way</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I remember, at one point, making a big presentation that said, 'What will leak? Everything.' Like, we just started with that assumption that things would leak,” technical director Christian Buhl told us. “Now, to be clear, we didn't want things to leak. We weren't seeking leaks, but we knew that the most important thing was to get the game in front of players, get real feedback from players, get real telemetry, real data, and that had to come at any cost, including the fact that things would leak.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Battlefield 6 ahead of its October 10 release date, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6s-battle-royale-footage-has-leaked-heres-what-it-shows-us"><u>another leak from earlier this month</u></a>.
