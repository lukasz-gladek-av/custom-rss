            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-online-on-pc-is-finally-getting-current-gen-console-features-in-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, in a sort of buried, sly wink kind of way, Rockstar Games announced it would finally bring PS5 and Xbox Series console features to the PC version of Grand Theft Auto Online sometime next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hidden at the bottom of a GTA Online community update today, Rockstar said the following: "There is much more still to come, including ongoing weekly special events and bonuses, festive celebrations, gifts, surprises, as well as plans to bring the much-requested PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S features of GTA Online to the PC platform in the new year. Please stay tuned to the Rockstar Games Newswire for details."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What this refers to are the features contained exclusively in the enhanced release of GTA 5 for PS5 and Xbox Series consoles that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-5-online-ps5-xbox-series-x-new-features-revealed">launched back in 2022</a>. These included everything from graphics setting enhancements to actual new features, including quality of life improvements, a new intro and tutorial, new vehicle upgrades, and a lot more. There's also character transfer features that allowed players to transfer story mode progress and GTA Online characters from prior gen systems to current-gen and even cross-platform, which suggests we may be able to similarly transfer progress to PC now too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an update that's been due for several years now, and fans have been asking for it pretty much since the enhanced editions landed on console.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the community update, which talks about the stuff actually showing up in GTA Online for everyone in December, including new things to do at the Darnell Bros Garment Factory, new missions, vehicles, and some quality of life improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's plenty to be getting on with while you wait for GTA 6, which we've learned is still a ways away, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-take-two-interactive">currently planned for fall of 2025</a>. GTA 6, unfortunately, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6s-announced-platforms-for-2025-release-date-dont-include-pc">doesn't have a PC version coming at release</a>, but hopefully it will only be a matter of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
