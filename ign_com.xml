            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Flood plain, fire risk, black mold, and it's going to fall into the ocean."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard has partnered with real estate website Zillow to create Zillow for Warcraft, a goofy Zillow-like website intended to promote the game's new player housing feature with humor, information, and a free in-game item.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The website, accessible at <a href="https://zillowforwarcraft.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zillowforwarcraft.com</a> or <a href="https://zillow.com/warcraft" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zillow.com/warcraft</a>, is, to be clear, a goof. At the moment, it doesn't seem to be showing off actual houses built by real players. It instead has a curated selection of both Horde and Alliance homes that seem to be intended more to offer inspiration to players working on their own homes than anything. Besides, it's not like you can actually buy someone else's fully built and decorated house in the game, anyway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The website is cute, though. It's got a handful of different housing options on different plots in both the Horde and Alliance neighborhoods to skim through, with humorous descriptions of decor decisions and, frankly, some pretty good ideas that I hadn't really thought of for my own rustic shack. You're guided through the website by Bek'tar Donhammar and Hazyl Fizzlehorn, two fictional Azerothian real estate agents who each have their own profiles with "reviews" from satisfied customers, all rife with in-jokes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The main reason you might care to visit the website, though, is to get the free item. If you link your battle.net account, you can get a free "Naturally Elegant Doormat" which will show up in the in-game mail after the fact and become available for use in decorating your house. It's not a bad doormat! Worth the, like, four clicks it takes to get it. Once you have one, you can also buy more copies of it from Tuuran and Gabbi near the Trading Posts in Stormwind and Orgrimmar, in case you want a house just full of mats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps even more delightful than just clicking around on the website though are some of the player reactions to the feature. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1r74zix/zillow_teams_with_world_of_warcraft_for_player/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit thread</a> about the announcement, a number of individuals have popped in to offer pleasant snark about the crossover, generally mixed in with commentary about how expensive real-life houses are nowadays.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"last sold in ‘88 for 49,000, now going for 449,000, cool cool cool," reads the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1r74zix/comment/o5uwst8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top comment by u/Helios420A</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hasn’t had work done since Blackhand was Warchief," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1r74zix/comment/o5wmdnm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes u/Thesleek</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Does this mean blackrock will somehow get involved next?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1r74zix/comment/o5ux553/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked u/notmyworkaccount5</a>, making a very well-placed pun on BlackRock Inc, the investment company, and Blackrock, the World of Warcraft orc clan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that I have my doormat, I will proceed to log in and rearrange my living room for the umpteenth time, wasting several hours before finally admitting I will never make anything as magical as the <a href="https://zillowforwarcraft.com/#/homedetails/alliance-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ban'ethil Bohemian</a>, and go back to adding spikes to my roof.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Its <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/wildlight-entertainment/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official LinkedIn page</a> has long included the line that Wildlight is "a new, fully-funded entertainment studio."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That grand announcement, its time and place <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2026/01/17/highguard-did-not-pay-for-its-infamous-game-awards-finale-slot/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instigated by The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley</a> rather than the studio, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/can-we-stop-dunking-on-highguard-before-its-even-out-please">sparked weeks of mockery online</a>, with a number of content creators declaring the game dead before it had even released. Upon launch, Highguard <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/highguard-launches-to-big-steam-concurrents-but-its-getting-absolutely-destroyed-in-user-reviews">netted nearly 100k Steam concurrents,</a> but critic reviews <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/highguard-review">(including ours)</a> were just so-so and user scores were low. Just a few weeks later, developers from Wildlight revealed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/highguard-studio-wildlight-hit-with-layoffs">most of them had been laid off</a>. Since then, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-highguard-developer-reflects-on-disastrous-announcement-and-launch-we-were-turned-into-a-joke-from-minute-1">one developer who worked on the game</a> has reflected that Highguard was "turned into a joke from minute one" due to false assumptions made from the TGA trailer, and a number of other high-profile developers have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/when-did-it-become-trendy-to-hate-on-a-new-game-as-highguard-struggles-to-win-over-the-internet-video-game-developers-come-to-its-defense">come to its defense</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It remains unclear how heavily reliant Wildlight was on Tencent, or whether a decision to pull funding was made at some point that led to the mass layoffs. Wildlight's future as a studio also remains unclear, with a studio statement saying that it would retain a "core group of developers" to keep Highguard going. However, the game's <a href="https://playhighguard.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website went offline</a> earlier today and has yet to be restored, leading some to speculate that the game or even the studio is about to fully shut down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Having seen just some of the cards included, though, I’m impressed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic’s New Turtle Power Precon Looks Awesome</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I should preface this ‘precon preview’ with an explanation that in our behind-closed-doors look at the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set, Wizards revealed around a dozen cards from the Turtle Power precon - but there are more reveals to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That means we’ve not been able to see how the deck plays, but we do know that your Commander of choice can be any of the Turtles, two of them partnered up with the Partner ability, or all five with the Heroes in a Half Shell card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s nothing truly revolutionary about this modular approach (swapping Commander precons to use other Legendary Creatures within them as their leader is part of the fun of the format), but having five options for Turtles means that no one is left behind.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes the likes of Splinter (who has the Partner mechanic, too), but also members of the TMNT’s rogues gallery like Baxter, Fly in the Ointment, Leatherhead, Iron Gator, and, of course, Shredder, Shadow Master.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also some fun nods to the gaming history of the awesome foursome. Electric Seaweed from the hard-as-nails NES game makes an appearance to strike fear into gamers of a certain age, while other cards reference the squad’s love of arcade machines, like High Score and, uh, Arcade Cabinet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will the deck play well? We’ll have to wait to find out, but in terms of cramming as much personality into a single precon as possible, I think Wizards of the Coast may have just nailed the assignment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set launches on March 6, with preorders already available for the Turtle Power precon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.
