Their surprise availability with the launch of Season 1 was welcomed by players deep into the Call of Duty grind, but their equally surprising removal caused an outcry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, developer Treyarch said it patched the legacy XP tokens out of Black Ops 6 because their accidental introduction, which it blamed on a UI bug, "introduced some potential risk to game stability."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, today’s update improves the hitmarker user interface to help identify shots more easily, and fixes a number of bugs across Multiplayer and Zombies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking on Zombies mode?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-reveals-how-many-copies-control-2-and-firebreak-need-to-sell-to-break-even<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The million dollar question.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Remedy has provided a rare insight into the business of making video games, even going as far as to reveal exactly how many copies its future games need to sell in order to break even.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video game industry is typically secretive when it comes to its commercial realities, and rarely does it provide development or marketing budgets or sales projections. But Remedy, developer of Alan Wake 2, has done just that in <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an investment-focused meeting</a>, discussing the upcoming Control 2 PvE shooter FBC Firebreak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth prefacing this by saying Remedy is talking about the sales needed to make a 100% return on investment (ROI) on these games, and that’s expected over a period of three to five years after. The game budgets, Remedy said, were set with their price points and expected sales in mind, and are “realistic.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/19/screenshot-2024-11-19-161612-1732034421560.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Remedy Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with FBC Firebreak, Remedy's new multiplayer game set in the Control universe billed as a three-player co-op experience (it’s worth bearing in mind FBC Firebreak will be available day one on Xbox Game Pass and PS Plus Extra, which will secure additional revenue from Microsoft and Sony).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The development budget for Firebreak is 30 million euros (approx $31.7 million), and will carry a mid-price point. To secure 100% ROI, it needs to sell three million copies during its lifetime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to Control 2, as a full-price triple-A game Remedy is set to self-publish (and therefore retain a larger cut of revenue), the development budget is higher: 50 million euros (approx $52.9 million). Control 2 needs to sell between three and four million copies to break even. Control 2, by the way, is an action RPG, Remedy said today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is that realistic? According to Remedy, the first Control game has now sold over 4.5 million, so it’ll be hoping Control 2 can reach or even exceed that figure. Encouraging the studio will be the fact that Control has reached an impressive 19 million players with the help of various subscription services, so the audience interested in the sequel should be significant.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re only as good as your last game, though, and for Remedy that’s Alan Wake 2. The horror adventure is now up to 1.8 million copies sold, and it still hasn’t turned a profit (although it’s close to doing so).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The triple-A video game market is particularly brutal right now, with thousands of developers losing their jobs and an ever growing list of studios shutting their doors. Throughout it all Remedy has remained independent, although in September it received a 15 million euro (approx $15.8 million) loan from Tencent as part of its self-publishing push.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Remedy is also working on remakes of the first two Max Payne games for GTA 6 developer Rockstar Games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It's unclear which locations will see the Minecraft attractions built as of yet, but Merlin did say it will be investing in excess of £85 million ($110 million) in the first two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Merlin is looking to "bring Minecraft adventures to life," the company said.

A rendering of what the Minecraft theme park will look like can be seen above.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This announcement comes as Minecraft continues to expand its brand far beyond its game, which is one of the most popular of all time already. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-minecraft-sets">Minecrat Lego and other toys have existed for years</a>, though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-movie-reveals-first-look-at-crafting-table-in-action">a live action film starring Jack Black will bolster the IP when it arrives April 4, 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Partnering with Merlin Entertainments is an incredibly exciting step for us at Mojang Studios," commented Kayleen Walters, Vice-President Franchise Development for Gaming at Microsoft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Merlin's expertise in creating world-class attractions makes them the perfect partner to help us bring Minecraft to life in new and immersive ways in permanent locations around the globe. Our vast and diverse community is always looking for new opportunities to explore and engage with Minecraft, and we are thrilled to build touchpoints around the globe that will surprise and delight them. These new real-life Minecraft experiences will not only grow our community but also offer fans many more opportunities to immerse themselves in the world of Minecraft in ways they've never imagined."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Video games are increasingly encroaching on the theme park space overall, with Nintendo leading efforts through <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-nintendo-world-review">its Super Nintendo World locations across the globe</a>. These are continuing to expand too, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-details-of-donkey-kong-country-theme-park-at-super-nintendo-world-announced">Donkey Kong soon being added to the mix</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
