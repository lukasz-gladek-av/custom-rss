Right now, you can get it without heatsink for $129.99 or with heatsink (at <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAV6eb?object_uuid=c22c6669-3acd-407d-a8b6-f9523ca0c4d5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart</a>) for $139.99. The WD Black SN850X is one of the best performing PCIe 4.0 SSDs on the market; this is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-ssd">best SSD for your PlayStation 5 console</a>, but it can also be a blazing-fast boot drive for your gaming rig.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2TB WD Black SN850X PS5 SSD (Without Heatsink)</h2><div catalogid="7802e9e7-6a2b-4ead-a7ae-1ee8af772012" id="200160"><div id="200160" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>WD Black SN850X 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">2TB WD Black SN850X PS5 SSD (With Heatsink)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d8fe4dc-95eb-4e0c-9293-5792ccaff9b1" id="175040"><div id="175040" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>WD Black SN850X 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD with Preinstalled Heatsink</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/wd-black-sn850x-nvme-ssd">SN850X</a> is the latest generation of WD's flagship Black series M.2 SSDs. In terms of performance, it's considered a top-tier SSD with sustained read speeds of up to 7,300MBps, write speeds of 6,600MBps, random read speeds of up to 1,200K IOPS, and write speeds of 1,100IOPS. It's faster than the previous generation SN850 thanks to newer flash chips (BiCS5 vs BiCS4) and an updated firmware. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you plan to install this in your gaming PC, WD includes Game Mode 2.0 utility software that's designed to tune the SSD for better performance during gaming sessions. Unless you have an unlimited budget, 2TB is the size I would recommend for a boot solid state drive; for most people, this is plenty of space for your OS and apps, and the price is still reasonable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The SN850X also makes for an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-ssd">excellent SSD for your PlayStation 5 console</a>. It's identical to Sony's officially licensed WD SN850P SSD. It more than fulfills all of Sony's PS5 recommendations, including a M.2 2280 form factor, minimum 5,500MB/s speed, and PCI-E Gen4x4 interface. You can get the version with the pre-installed heatsink for $10 more, or you can just pick out a <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVDjed?object_uuid=c22c6669-3acd-407d-a8b6-f9523ca0c4d5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">cheaper heatsink</a> (it's very easy to install).

The deal is set to run through <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> and expire after December 24.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should You Wait for Black Friday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That is a great question.

The WD SN850X, however, is one of the fastest SSDs on the market and if you're looking for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssd">best of the best</a>, we think there's a slim chance that you'll find a better deal. However, if you're more flexible and willing to buy an SSD that isn't quite the best, but still fast enough to fulfill all of Sony's recommended PS5 specs, then you should wait and find a deal that's closer to $100.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

            <title><![CDATA[Of Ash & Steel First Preview: A Medieval Fantasy RPG With Potential]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/of-ash-steel-first-preview-a-medieval-fantasy-rpg-with-potential</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/of-ash-steel-first-preview-a-medieval-fantasy-rpg-with-potential.1038768/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/of-ash-steel-first-preview-a-medieval-fantasy-rpg-with-potential<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Of Ash and Steel looks solid so far, but it also likely won’t strike you as anything you haven’t heard before. I was given a hands-off glimpse into this medieval fantasy action-RPG set in an unforgiving world, where your actions will shape the fate of an entire land. (See what I mean?)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our session, I witnessed roughly 20 minutes of gameplay, followed by a Q&amp;A with the developers, Fire &amp; Frost – a studio formed with the express intention of making a game inspired by classic RPGs from the 2000s. Think The Witcher, Fable, and the Gothic series, amongst others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the beginning the developers stressed that there would be none of the UI or map markers you find in today’s games, which could be fun or painful depending on what kind of gamer you are. For me personally, this was one of the most exciting things about Of Ash and Steel – I immediately envisioned the joy (and sometimes frustration, but fun frustration) of getting hopelessly lost while trying to pinpoint an objective with next to no direction. Mankrik’s Wife, anyone?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Of Ash &amp; Steel - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this will work best if there are things to enjoy, even if you don’t find your objective right away. The developers promise there’ll be a lot of that, and I saw some hints of small joys. For instance, I giggled when the protagonist at one point tripped over a rock, that silly goose.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">“You look familiar…”</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of, let’s discuss the guy whose skin we’re going to inhabit. He’s a capital-D Dude: stubbled, ripped, and wearing a perpetual smirk. And, as per the classic RPG formula, he starts as a nobody and has to work his way up into heroism.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He looks oddly smooth and botoxed for a guy who gets into lots of fights – I saw NPCs whose features had more personality than our leading man’s. It didn’t help that the gameplay I saw didn’t have any voiceover yet – maybe, when voiced, Dude will become more likable. We’ll see. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There sadly won’t be a female version of this playable character, however Dude will be lightly customizable (for example, you can change his hair). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m most entertained by the idea of knocking out all my enemies, tavern-brawl style.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">His combat opponents range from garden-variety goblins to well-equipped bandits. The combat is standard RPG fare: hack-and-slash swordplay with a bit of archery thrown in. You can unlock new combat skills as you progress, allowing you to customize your playstyle – though I didn’t really have a clear idea of the possibilities. You can pick up rocks and bottles in the immediate environment, and I’m most entertained by the idea of knocking out all my enemies, tavern-brawl style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And for those into more… “gritty” combat, don’t worry: there’s a kill cam.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">A cozy world</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Non-combat activities are also available, such as crafting and fishing. Though I didn’t see it in action, it sounds like various forms of crafting may get pretty nuanced: you can make specific handles or blades for swords, for instance. Other money-making ventures include cooking, alchemy… and the good ol’ method of looting the bodies of your fallen foes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers promise a “cozy” world, a design decision made so players didn’t get too lost without their quest markers. I definitely got a sense of that coziness from the forest, especially as the weather changed to rain, signaling time to set up camp and stay dry. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I saw scenes in a forest and a town, but there will be other biomes to explore as well, like underwater caves. The soundtrack doesn’t just offer music for each setting, but variations on that music based on factors like time of day. Imagine soft morning sun filtering through forest leaves, the music swelling with the promise of a new day… or the soundtrack taking on a sinister tone as night falls.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The developers promise a “cozy” world, a design decision made so players didn’t get too lost without their quest markers.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the narrative, details are scant. You’re in an island kingdom that was once prosperous. There are two main factions, and within them sub-factions, such as bounty hunters or smugglers. (Personally, I’m looking forward to becoming a Gravedigger – acquiring valuables in an… unconventional way.) You can make choices that “shape the world around you,” but I’m skeptical how much that will affect the overall ending. I hope to be pleasantly surprised.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What’s the story?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, I must state that this was a “hands-off” preview, and my thoughts are based on observation alone. Without being able to play a build myself, it’s difficult to determine if the combat will feel particularly awesome, or if the story will really leave a lasting impression. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I think that’s what will really anchor this experience: the story. There are hints of humor that I’m hoping will contrast, by the end, with a more epic tale of strife and survival. Right now I’d call this a game for RPG players to keep an eye on, but if the developers can really nail that story – and elevate the Dude beyond genericism – that’s what will distinguish Of Ash and Steel within the realm of medieval fantasy RPGs.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
