IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-review">GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition review</a> returned a 5/10.

Each week leading up to the event will slowly roll out more deals, which ultimately leads to Black Friday. Retailers will not reveal their biggest Black Friday deals until the big day, but most general deals will be available well in advance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Christian Wait is a UK-based freelancer for IGN, you can follow him @ChrisReggieWait on Twitter/X.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Nov 12, 2024 12:46 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
