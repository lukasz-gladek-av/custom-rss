Ahead of San Diego Comic-Con 2025, IGN can exclusively reveal the next chapter in the Cult of the Lamb Saga, Cult of the Lamb: Schism Special #1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cult of the Lamb: Schism Special #1 is a one-shot, 48-page comic that reunites the creative team from The First Verse, including writer Alex Paknadel (Red Goblin) and artist Troy Little (Rick and Morty vs. Cthulu). This new issue is again a collaboration between comic book publisher Oni Press, game publisher Devolver Digital, and development studio Massive Monster.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/10/unnamed15-1752169639896.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Art by Peach Momoko.

More potential followers are rescued by the day, but with no one to indoctrinate them, Lamb’s power stagnates and The One Who Waits becomes weary of his earthly vessel’s resistance to the full power and responsibility of the Red Crown. When famine strikes the cult, a challenger to Lamb’s mantle emerges, and a new struggle begins...</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Let me just clear the air here: I’m not a gamer. At least, I thought I wasn’t until this extraordinary story landed in my lap," Paknadel told IGN about The First Verse. "A perfect innocent – a sacrificial lamb - is given the means to avenge themselves against the tyrannical system that threw them under the bus for a paltry superstition. It’s a classic revenge fantasy, but it also contains the seeds of truly epic tragedy.Get ready to experience the events of the game from the Lamb’s perspective – their fall and rise and fall - and see why the tragedy of The One Who Waits’ anointed avenger only began with their death."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/10/unnamed16-1752169639896.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Art by Troy Little.

Its combat is immensely satisfying even if its short runs and the relative lack of variety between them doesn’t give it the lasting appeal of other action roguelikes, and building my very own cult base and tending to a flock of followers was just as fun as any swing of the axe. I may not revisit it now that the credits have rolled, but Cult of the Lamb is something altogether different that I had an absolute blast playing."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cult of the Lamb: The First Verse Image Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cult of the Lamb was recently updated in August 2024 with the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/cult-of-the-lamb-official-unholy-alliance-launch-trailer">the DLC expansion Unholy Alliance</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.
