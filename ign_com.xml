            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Magic Puzzle Company is one of my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">favorite jigsaw puzzle brands</a> on the market right now. Each puzzle is made up of 1,000 unique pieces and filled with fun little easter eggs throughout. Best of all, when you finally complete the puzzle you are treated to a secret ending that is different for each one. I personally love these puzzles because every image has some serious 'Where's Waldo' vibes and utilizes different artwork from popular artists I would have otherwise never known about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you aren't already familiar with the earlier <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzles">Magic Puzzle Company Puzzles</a>, I'd recommend checking out Series One to get started. However, if you're a seasoned veteran you'll be happy to know that Amazon has just released two new Series Five puzzles for 2026 and they look quite delightful.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New Series Five Magic Puzzle Company Puzzles</h2><div id="234491"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234491" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Golden Goose</h3></p></div></span></p></div><div id="234492"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234492" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Coveted Comet</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Series Five is the latest series in the Magic Puzzle Company lineup, and these two new puzzles are likely the last entries we'll see until Series Six. Each series has been comprised of three total puzzles, and the first puzzle in this series was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-series-five-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzle-features-art-from-an-adventure-time-designer">actually released back in August 2025</a>. The first option is called The Drippy Trip and features artwork from one of the original Adventure Time artists. I own this puzzle and can confirm that it is an absolute delight to put together—especially as a big Adventure Time fan</p></div><div id="226763"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="226763" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Drippy Trip</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the two new puzzles, the Golden Goose has sort of an early civilization vibe. The artwork is by <a href="https://www.anineillustration.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anine Bösenberg</a>, who cultivates a wonderful illustration style that does a great job of feeling cozy and alive without too much heavy detail. This puzzle is already available on Amazon, but in limited quantities. If stock runs out, however, you can purchase the Series Five bundle to get the full set later in February.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second new puzzle is called The Coveted Comet and looks to feature a colony of aliens inhabiting  some sort of comet or asteroid. The overall design is reminiscent of those cross-section books that show you everything going on within a single building, but with a more organic feel. The artwork comes from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/samuelhayward_art/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samuel Hayward</a>, who appears to have a knack for creating adorable prints. This puzzle isn't available until February 15, but you can currently preorder it on Amazon ahead of its release date.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Magic Puzzle Company Puzzles</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for more puzzles from this brand, you can check out some of the more popular options from previous releases right here:</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 15, 2026 6:49 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/new-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzles-series-five-2026]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-1032-buffs-all-the-worst-nightfarers</link>
            <guid>1407424</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> just got a big balance patch, and even if you're not someone who's great at parsing patch notes, you might want to tune into this one, because basically every character that's been widely regarded as terrible for months now got a big buff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 1.03.2 is simply billed as "Balance Adjustments and Feature Updates" but includes a very, very long list of Nightfarer, Relic, Equipment, Sorcery, Incantations, and other adjustments that should prove a major boon especially to a few Nightfarers that desperately needed some love: Raider, Guardian, Executor, and Revenant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've shared the patch notes below, but here's a quick summary for each of these four characters. Guardian, whose role is generally to "tank" bosses, guard hits, and keep enemy attention so their teammates can wail on them, got a buff to damage negation and to his Guard Boost ability. Raider, a big slow heavy attacker, has historically been a little<em> too </em>slow in attacking to be really viable, so he got a big boost to attack speed. Revenant, historically just weak all around if very fun to play, got a big attack power boost to her summoned spirits. And Executor, a speedy melee attacker who plays a bit like Wolf in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, got buffs to seemingly everything: damage, stamina, damage negation, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The community, especially those who like to main those four Nightfarers, are especially thrilled. Several of these guys, especially Raider and Revenant, have been struggling for a while now, and their weaknesses were becoming even more evident next to the two newly-added Nightfarers in the Forsaken Hollows DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those aren't the only changes, just the biggest character-related ones. There have been a ton of tweaks and bug fixes to everything from how many of certain items can be bought in shops to how much FP certain spells cost to cast. There were also, quietly, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1qdoatt/30_weapons_id_slots_added/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30 new weapon ID slots added to the game</a>, as someone has pointed out, though it's unclear what those are for or even if they'll ever be used. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightreign players are still going strong almost a year after the game first came out, with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-its-first-dlc-next-month">new DLC having dropped in December</a> adding a new map, two new Nightfarers, new bosses, and more.

Fallout Shelter the Prime Video series is a reality competition show along similar lines to Beast Games.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Good morning, prospective Vault Dwellers! In order to best serve you in What Comes Next, we need volunteers for a very real, very scientific opportunity to beta test a better society.

Across a series of escalating challenges, strategic dilemmas, and moral crossroads, contestants must prove their ingenuity, teamwork, and resilience as they compete for safety, power, and ultimately a huge cash prize.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the Fallout Shelter program description, from the now open <a href="https://falloutsheltercasting.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">casting call</a>:</p><blockquote>Fallout Shelter (working title) is a new reality competition series based on the hit Amazon drama and computer game of the same name. The dwellers (contestants) live together in a top-secret vault, where they will compete in a series of games that tests the seven core attributes from the Fallout world. Strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck (S.P.E.C.I.A.L).</blockquote><blockquote>The series will not only test dwellers’ core attributes, but also their loyalty and alliances. It’s a game of power dynamics, popularity and social strategy which will ultimately result in a huge cash prize, but do you have what it takes to be the most S.P.E.C.I.A.L?.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s produced by Studio Lambert, the company that’s also behind The Traitors and Squid Game: The Challenge.
