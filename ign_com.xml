            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-black-friday-deals-to-shop-at-gamestop-right-now%E2%80%93what-id-buy.1044225/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gamestop-black-friday-sale-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In spite of it all, GameStop has persevered and still gets after it for the Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals period. The GameStop near my house closed down in 2021 and I've really missed it. There's something to be said about getting to know your local GameStop staff and talking games with them for a while. I've also been seeing some locations are doing midnight launches again, and my friends, everyone should wait in line to buy a hot new game the second it goes live. You will be among your people, an unbroken queue of like-minded individuals looking to share in the communal experience of celebrating gaming. I feel like gaming culture was better when we all stood together and talked to one another about how stoked we were for Halo 3. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wGEYb?object_uuid=f764efae-6e17-4f5c-809a-2c5128e6231d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GameStop</a> has some solid Black Friday video game deals, and if you don't mind buying used, you can actually save a bunch more. But the biggest problem is not all the deals at GameStop are as good as they are at competitors. For example, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-early-black-friday-2024">50% off Final Fantasy XVI deal</a> that's been crushing all week isn't at GameStop (it's $5 more than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-2024">Amazon's Black Friday</a> price). But lots of others, like Tomb Raider I-III Remaster and Sea of Stars, are the same price as they are at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-early-black-friday-video-game-deals">Best Buy's Black Friday video game sales</a>. Of course, we've been following all the deals and have a full look at all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">best Black Friday deals of 2024</a>, not JUST video game deals.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">GameStop Best Black Friday Deals</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">X-Men '97 Magneto Helmet Black Friday Deal</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Definitely want to shine some light on this one because, not only is the price of the Magneto X-Men '97 helmet discounted 55%, it's also one of the most popular items I've featured on the <a href="https://x.com/IGNDeals" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGNDeals X</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/igndeals/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGNDeals Instagram</a> accounts this year... and it wasn't even close to this low of a price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seriously, if you want a cosplay-quality Magneto helmet you can wear comfortably, or you just want to get it for display (it has a stand), this is probably GameStop's best Black Friday deal going right now.</p><div catalogid="fcb07082-590a-4f71-978d-04b58e741ca5" id="211095"><div id="211095" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Best GameStop Black Friday Deal So Far</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hasbro Marvel Legends Series  X-Men '97 Magneto Helmet</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Premium role-play 1:1 scale helmet with padding and adjustable size.</p></div></div><h2 data-cy="title2">$39.99 Black Friday Video Game Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, the selection of $39.99 isn't exactly great. I think Lies of P is probably the stand-out here. That being said, it's still early and I would not be surprised at all if this deals page gets updated with a lot more games, but I would also not be surprised if it didn't. I'm on an even-keel here, nothing can surprise me.</p></div><div catalogid="47791507-f893-4dde-8a88-5234c4a358c9" id="211171"><div id="211171" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>GameStop $39.99 Video Game Deals</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>This is the landing page for all of GameStop's $40 gaming deals for Black Friday.</p></div></div><h2 data-cy="title2">$29.99 Black Friday Video Game Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we're getting somewhere. In spite of what the page might try to make you believe, some of these games are actually cheaper than $29.99, and the selection here is pretty great, too. Stand-out games on this landing page include Mortal Kombat 1, Sea of Stars, and the absolutely excellent Atari 50: The Anniversary Collection Extended Edition. </p></div><div catalogid="89e5befb-8c13-435a-8e51-4cbda21520b2" id="211172"><div id="211172" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>GameStop $29.99 Video Game Deals</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>This is the landing page for all of GameStop's $20-$30 gaming deals for Black Friday.</p></div></div><h2 data-cy="title2">$19.99 Black Friday Video Game Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the sweet spot in my opinion. The price is excellent and the selection of $20 games on sale for Black Friday is also pretty admirable. The stand-outs here are probably Hogwart's Legacy, Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition, Lords of the Fallen and Tomb Raider I-III Remastered. But that's just my opinion – I leave it to you to find the games you want to buy. I can only lead you to them, I cannot make up your mind for you.</p></div><div catalogid="89e5befb-8c13-435a-8e51-4cbda21520b2" id="211172"><div id="211172" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>GameStop $29.99 Video Game Deals</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>This is the landing page for all of GameStop's $20-$30 gaming deals for Black Friday.</p></div></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Buy 1, Get 1 50% Off on Plushies</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm just going to go ahead and say you should buy the Sonic the Hedgehog Ice Cream plushie. The real one has dead eyes made of bubblegum, exactly what you want to enjoy with a frozen treat. There are also a lot of non-Sonic ice cream plushies, too, like Kuromi, Gengar, Squishmallows and more.</p></div><div catalogid="9933d64d-60a9-498b-957d-9890c778f700" id="211183"><div id="211183" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buy 1 Get 1 50% Off Plushies</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>So many adorable new friends to bring home.</p></div></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch Black Friday Deals at GameStop</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">GameStop has both the Nintendo Switch Black Friday Mario Kart bundles, and Pro members save $25, which is a nice little extra bonus savings. Other than that, these have been available since... August, I think? If you know someone who doesn't have a Switch and you're shopping at GameStop anyway, go wild.</p></div><div catalogid="f61edd28-af93-49a5-bad5-d0cf8db6529a" id="211175"><div id="211175" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Nintendo Switch Bundles</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>If you want to gamble but you hate risk, this is a sure bet. A variation of this bundle has been the Black Friday Nintendo deal since... 2018? Maybe earlier.</p></div></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Should I Wait to Buy Games at GameStop's Black Friday Sale?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to buy any of the games currently listed on sale, I say go for it. If anything, it'll just add more games as the shopping event heats up. Definitely get on that Sonic plush, though. Who knows how long it will last? It will definitely be worth waiting for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-time-to-buy-a-playstation-5">best time to buy a PS5</a>, though, because it's not currently listed, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024">Sony has announced its Black Friday deals</a>.

If you're a <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5bV5d?object_uuid=859e3d11-fa8f-48f6-a799-694898694ee9&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart+</a> member, there's a 5-hour early access that starts <strong>12 PM ET on Monday, November 25. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If it doesn't sell out within that time, it'll be live at 5 PM ET for everyone else.

We'll endeavor to update you when the deal is live, and if retailers like Best Buy and Target price match the offer as well.</p><div catalogid="d43fd930-1c94-4160-a6ed-07908b619be2" id="211474"><div id="211474" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Should You Sign Up for Walmart+ Before Nov. 25?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While one of the standout deals in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-walmart-early-black-friday-deals-2024">Walmart’s first wave of Black Friday offers</a> is a 50% discount on a 12-month Walmart+ membership, it's still probably not worth signing up just to snag a single deal. You’d likely be better off purchasing the game at Target for $40. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, consider whether early access to Walmart’s upcoming deals or the other benefits of a 12-month membership makes sense for you. Take some time to weigh the value of the subscription against your shopping habits to decide if it’s the right choice.</p></div><div catalogid="ffb2807f-13c0-4d38-a85c-dc765656ace1" id="210375"><div id="210375" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Walmart+ 12-Month Membership</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Can't Wait? Tears of the Kingdom is $39.99 at Target Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like we said, if you can't wait, or as a backup, Tears of the Kingdom is $39.99 at Target for Black Friday from today onwards. It's is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-games-2">best games on Nintendo Switch</a>, and the sequel to Breath of the Wild brings new areas to explore in the clouds and depths below the surface, offering what feels like a brand-new take on Hyrule. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It begins one year after Breath of the Wild. One day, while exploring under Hyrule Castle, Princess Zelda and Link discover a mummy that comes alive, shattering the Master Sword and wounding Link. When he awakens, Link finds himself on the Great Sky Island, one of the many floating islands in the sky. Here, the many mysteries of the ancient Zonai tribe are revealed.</p></div><div catalogid="ddb149a2-d46b-4935-838f-af1cd363d65f" id="211385"><div id="211385" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">What We Said in Our Review</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">our 10/10 review</a>, we said Tears of the Kingdom "is an unfathomable follow-up to one of the greatest games ever made, somehow improving upon it in nearly every way – be that with simple quality-of-life improvements, a genuinely exciting story, or wildly creative new building mechanics that make you rethink what is possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It both revamps old ground and introduces vast new areas so immense it somehow makes me wonder if Breath of the Wild was actually all that big, with an almost alarming number of tasks to complete, mysteries to discover, and delightful distractions to keep you from ever reaching that place you naively thought you were headed. Nintendo has followed up a triumph with a triumph, expanding and evolving a world that already felt full beyond expectation and raising the bar ever higher into the clouds."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Black Friday Game Deals We've Found So Far</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual date of<strong> </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024"><strong>Black Friday</strong></a><strong> in 2024 falls on November 29</strong>, but the holiday deals season starts a lot earlier than that.
