This adds all previous 1.6 content to PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android, alongside some new stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've been holding out for the 1.6 release on console and mobile, we've got plenty of Stardew Valley 1.6 guides to help you through the new content, such as an explainer on the new Mastery Points system and new crops like Carrots and Broccoli.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Essential Stardew Valley 1.6 Guides</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Below, you'll find IGN guides that we recommend checking out to aid you in your farming adventure.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mastery Points</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/stardew-valley-1-6-mastery-points-1730744017673.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mastery Points system is a new feature that rewards those who have leveled all five Stardew Valley skills (Fishing, Farming, Combat, Foraging, and Mining) to level 10. Now, when you use a maxed-out skill, you'll gain EXP in the new Mastery Gauge. Once the Mastery Gauge is full, you'll get a Mastery Point that can be spent at Mastery Cave in Cindersap Forest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information on Mastery Points and the rewards you can spend them on, head to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Mastery_Points">our Mastery Points guide</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Raccoon Family Quests</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/stardew-valley-1-6-raccoon-quests-1730744095325.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Stardew Valley 1.6, you'll receive an announcement randomly telling you that a strong windstorm occurred overnight and if you head to Cindersap Forest, you'll find that there's now a giant treestump where a tree was. Once you repair the stump, a raccoon will be standing by it the next day, and he'll have a quest for you. This is actually a chain of quests known as the Raccoon Family Quests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you complete the quests, the raccoon's family will grow. You can accept a new quest from him every seven in-game days, and you'll get rewards for doing so, as well as new Shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Raccoon_Family_Quests">our Raccoon Family Quests guide</a> for walkthroughs on all the quests, as well as checkmarks to track your exact progress! </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Golden Joja Parrot</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/stardew-valley-1-6-golden-joja-parrot-1730744197074.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Struggling to track down all 130 Golden Walnuts on Ginger Island? The Golden Joja Parrot is here to helpâ€”for a price. In the Stardew Valley 1.6 update, you can now pay the Golden Joja Parrot 10,000g to tell you the location of a Golden Walnut. It's a pricy service, but if you can afford it, it's very useful. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, we would recommend NOT spending 10,000g (sorry, birdy!) and instead using <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/All_Golden_Walnuts">our All Golden Walnuts guide</a> to track down the 130 Golden Walnuts scattered around Ginger Island. We've also got checkmarks so you can check off the ones you've found.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">New Fish and Resources</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A fish, the Goby, has been added in Stardew Valley 1.6, which you can learn more about, including location, season, and selling price, in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Fish">our Fish guide</a>.

You'll need the Fish Smoker for a Raccoon Family Quest!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Head to the following guides to learn more about obtaining the new fishable resources:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Sea_Jelly">Sea Jelly</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/River_Jelly">River Jelly</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Cave_Jelly">Cave Jelly</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">New Crops</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside a fish, there are also four additional crops for you to grow.
