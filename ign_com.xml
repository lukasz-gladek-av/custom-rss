            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I owe Donkey Kong Country Returns HD an apology. I laughed in disbelief at its initial announcement because it’s not only the third time Nintendo has sold us a version of this 2010 Wii platformer, it’s also the third Switch re-release Donkey Kong has seen despite not getting a completely new adventure in the last decade. This remaster’s reveal felt like the wrong game at the wrong time, but it only took a few minutes of running across a decently spruced up Donkey Kong Island to realize Returns is still one of the best 2D platformers Nintendo has made this century. It has all the things I want from this genre: satisfying movement that demands skill and precision, a large lineup of replayable challenges stuffed with secrets to find, and a practically unparalleled attention to detail in its superb level design that’s pretty much only rivaled by its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/01/donkey-kong-tropical-freeze-for-switch-review">Tropical Freeze</a>. Even though the remaster itself feels barebones and a few elements could have used a slightly more modern touch, this is definitely the best way to play Returns and one of the top bananas in the Switch’s impressive platformer lineup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I barreled through 80 levels set in jungles, caves, and more, it struck me just how few games like this are made anymore. In an era where modern platformers like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-review">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">Astro Bot</a> mostly focus on wowing you with spectacle and joyously ushering you through their handcrafted digital theme parks, Returns stands out as it doubles down on the platforming itself. It’s full of tough levels and nail-biting moments that require you to master its central jumping, rolling, and swinging mechanics to overcome its biggest challenges. No shade to the two games I just mentioned – I adore them both – but revisiting Nintendo’s version of this classic platformer style is refreshing, and I love how it isn’t afraid to test you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Difficulty-wise, this is several steps above Mario and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review">Kirby</a>, and that’s another great differentiating factor from the other platformers in Nintendo’s stable. The level design is incredibly impressive: Every stage introduces a new idea and explores it to the fullest as it ramps up the challenge without ever making it unclear what is expected of you. To reclaim Donkey Kong’s home, you’ll have to outrun hordes of ape-eating spiders, avoid enormous lethal waves, and make perfect jumps across crumbling platforms, and it’s always exciting to see what obstacle will be thrown at you next.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>DK’s perfect controls and satisfying abilities keep the challenge fun.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The difficulty stays fun rather than frustrating thanks to Donkey Kong’s perfect controls and immensely satisfying abilities. There’s a distinct weight to the movement in Retro Studios’ pair of Donkey Kong games, as if you can really get a sense for the heft of this big ape as you move, resulting in a platformer more focused on momentum where you’ll often have to plan your moves ahead of time and gear up for that next huge leap. The advanced rolling-jump mechanic in particular – where Donkey Kong gets a free jump in midair after rolling off a ledge – leads to some of the most rewarding platforming out there when you pull off a crazy move to save yourself or snag a hard-to-reach collectible. Your options open up even more when you break Diddy Kong out of a barrel. He both doubles your max health and adds an extremely helpful hover ability that’s a game changer in tougher sections. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If testing your mettle isn’t for you, the optional Modern Mode – which is slightly altered from the 3DS port’s New Mode – adds extra hearts to DK and Diddy’s health, expands the inventory at Cranky Kong’s shop with more useful aids (like a Green Balloon that saves you after falling into a pit), and lets you take more consumable recovery items into each level. Plus, if there’s a stage you just can’t clear, Super Kong will eventually show up and offer to automatically beat it for you. I love challenging platformers, so I stuck to Classic Mode and never looked back, but these are at least great options for people who don’t like to get stuck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The one place Returns occasionally gets a little bit <em>too </em>mean is its on-rails minecart and rocket barrel levels. These areas can suffer from a lot of trial-and-error, where I frequently died to sudden enemies or obstacles I had no way of reasonably avoiding on my first attempt. This is worsened if you’re going for the hidden collectibles in each stage, where you’re almost guaranteed to miss at least some of them the first time through until you know the level’s patterns. It’s especially frustrating because everything in these sections is a one-hit kill; a problem Tropical Freeze later solved by introducing vehicle-specific health bars. To be fair, it’s not a huge issue – Modern Mode adds an item in Cranky’s shop that can make these sections less of a pain, and I still really enjoy them for how they break up the pace of the standard stages – but I can’t help but feel they could have used a bit of freshening up. Similarly, the boss fights are largely fantastic, but they still suffer from a complete lack of checkpoints, and being forced back to the beginning after dying in the final phase feels more like a waste of time than a meaningful challenge.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This really is just a new coat of paint and nothing more.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The absence of any updates to these stumbling points highlights just how barebones Returns HD is as a remaster. This really is just a combination of the Wii and 3DS versions of Returns with a new coat of paint, and nothing more. It’s a competent update, but it’s nowhere near the level of something like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-review">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> – the <em>other </em>Retro Studios game that got a shiny updated release on Switch. It certainly doesn’t look bad, and it almost always runs at a smooth 60 frames per second, but even Tropical Freeze’s 2018 Switch port looks noticeably nicer. That’s most apparent when comparing Donkey Kong’s character model across the two games: DK’s fur looks amazing in Tropical Freeze, but just a little bit off in Returns. This is very clearly still a Wii game in HD everywhere from the levels to the cutscenes, which is completely <em>fine</em>, but I would’ve liked to see the graphics get a bit more love when the movement otherwise aged so well. Still, this is undoubtedly the best way to play Returns, as the Wii version had mandatory waggling motion controls that have been mercifully made entirely optional, and the extra 3DS levels have been rescued from that version’s downgraded graphics and co-op that required two systems and copies. That makes Returns HD the first time you can play this adventure on your TV with traditional button controls and all of its content intact, and that’s great to see. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of multiplayer, Returns HD is fully playable in two-player co-op where a second player takes control of Diddy Kong, but it’s not necessarily how I would want to play through the entire campaign. It's different from its contemporary New Super Mario Bros. Wii, which was made with multiplayer in mind from the beginning, in that it feels more like a neat bonus feature tacked onto a single-player game. The camera is so zoomed in that it’s easy for someone to fall behind, and these levels are clearly designed around just one player given their abundance of falling platforms and fast-moving obstacles. There’s still fun to be found in multiplayer, and it’s by no means a <em>bad </em>experience – but unless you have a great co-op partner willing to deal with some slight annoyances (or a young child/sibling that’s just content to be along for the ride), your best bet is either flying solo or passing the controller back and forth, as was also the case back on Wii.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan's Platformer Hall of Fame</h3><p>Running and jumping with the best of them. Level-based platformers only -- Metroidvanias not included.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, it’s a testament to the original that almost nothing was changed for this remaster and the final product is still so great. The attention to detail in its level design is remarkable. Unlike Mario, there are no unexplained floating platforms or blocks – every single platform DK runs across is seamlessly built into the landscape, often through its masterful interplay between the foreground and background, and it all culminates in one of the most impressive, cohesive worlds in any platformer. The biggest highlight of this is the factory world, which wonderfully implements conveyor belts, gears, and other machinery as the main methods of getting around. The soundtrack and settings play it a little safe (especially when compared to its sequel), but it’s important to remember that the original Donkey Kong Country Returns was tasked with bringing the franchise back after years away, so Retro Studios naturally chose to revisit some of the staples.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each level is stuffed with secrets to find, too, with the classic KONG letters and plenty of puzzle pieces tucked away in seemingly every corner. Sometimes exploration slows down the otherwise furious pace more than I’d like – blowing air onto all the dandelions, flowers, and candles you pass feels clunky and is an outdated mechanic that Tropical Freeze rightfully removed – but I still had a blast spending roughly 15 hours tracking down every letter and bringing my save file to 100% completion while also tackling tons of worthwhile content that appears after the credits roll. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Somehow, Donkey Kong Country Returns returned (again), but Nintendo’s third full release of this 2010 Wii platformer is almost as fresh and fun today as it was 15 years ago. DK’s satisfying, weighty movement paves the way for a challenging, momentum-based platformer that demands more skill and precision than the average Nintendo game. But it stays fun rather than frustrating thanks to incredibly impressive level design that explores every clever idea to the fullest and a ton of hidden collectibles worth tracking down. As a remaster specifically, it’s no more than a passable update, with graphics that can only really be described as “good enough” and some outdated elements that could have used more modern touches, like a lack of checkpoints during boss fights and a few obnoxious sections full of one-hit kill obstacles. But Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is still a competent update and easily the best way to play one of the greatest 2D platformers Nintendo has released this century.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, perhaps the famous first-person shooter’s flight from Xbox shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-gaming-boss-phil-spencer-wont-rule-out-any-xbox-exclusive-making-the-jump-to-playstation-including-halo">Microsoft’s gaming chief Phil Spencer said there were no “red lines” in its first-party lineup when it comes to going multiplatform</a> — and that included Halo. Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer said every Xbox game is up for grabs when it comes to making the multiplatform jump. “I do not see sort of red lines in our portfolio that say ‘thou must not,’” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has so-far used older games released over a year ago for its multiplatform push as opposed to brand new games, but that will soon change with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which comes out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-finally-gets-a-release-date-for-xbox-and-playstation-gamescom-2024"><u>on PS5</u></a> just a few months after it launched on Xbox and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones is the latest first-party Xbox game to make the jump to a rival console, and follows the multiplatform release of Obsidian’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pentiment"><u>Pentiment</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grounded"><u>Grounded</u></a>, Tango Gameworks’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hi-fi-rush"><u>Hi-Fi Rush</u></a>, and Rare’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sea-of-thieves"><u>Sea of Thieves</u></a> earlier in 2024. In June, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-confirmed-for-ps5-xbox-games-showcase-2024"><u>Microsoft announced Id Software's upcoming Doom: The Dark Ages will also launch on PS5</u></a> this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer has said Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business — with the pressure now on to deliver following its eye-watering $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We run a business,” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5">Spencer said in August</a>. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore">As former Xbox executive Peter Moore told IGN last year</a>, bringing Halo to PlayStation will have been a topic of discussion at Microsoft for some time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Look, if Microsoft says, wait, we're doing $250 million on our own platforms, but if we then took Halo as, let's call it a third-party, we could do a billion… You got to think long and hard about that, right?” Moore said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I mean, you just got to go, yeah, should it be kept? It's a piece of intellectual property. It's bigger than just a game. And how do you leverage that? Those are the conversations that always happen with, how do you leverage it in everything that we would do?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's had its ups and downs, but look, Xbox wouldn't be what Xbox is without Halo. But yeah, I'm sure those conversations are happening. Whether they come to fruition, who knows? But they're definitely happening, I'm sure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft does face a potential backlash from hardcore Xbox fans who are already disgruntled after what they feel is a devaluing of the Xbox as a console, the lack of exclusives, and Microsoft’s marketing strategy for its gaming business. Losing Halo to PlayStation could spark yet another angry response, but Moore told IGN that won’t deter Microsoft from doing what’s right for its business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The question would be, ultimately, is that reaction enough not to make a fundamental business decision for the future of not only Microsoft’s business, but gaming in itself?” Moore said. “Those hardcore are getting smaller in size and older in age. You've got to cater to the generations that are coming through, because they're going to drive the business over the next 10, 20 years.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo isn’t alone in coming to PS5 and Switch 2. NateTheHate reported that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is also coming to PS5 and Switch 2. Windows Central additionally reported that Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition, Hellblade 2, and Age of Mythology are coming to PS5 in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, does Halo: The Master chief Collection's release on PS5 and Switch 2 open the door to other Halo games also going multiplatform? Could the next big Halo game launch across all platforms? Last year, tech experts said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-halo-games-moving-to-unreal-engine-as-developer-343-industries-officially-changes-its-name"><u>Halo’s move to Unreal Engine 5</u></a> would make it easier for developer Halo Studios, née 343 Industries, to take the game to PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
