            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has been dragging its feet when it comes to charging realistic prices for trading card games, especially with Pokémon TCG. Magic: The Gathering is playing out differently, however. We're seeing healthy competition between Amazon and TCGPlayer during today's price check, so there's plenty of options to explore at the best prices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's highlights also include preorders for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Lorwyn Eclipsed, plus a scary movie exclusive pre-order you won't want to miss.</p><p id="tldr-deals-for-today"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TL;DR: Deals for Today">TL;DR: Best Deals Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Amazon, you're getting Prime delivery, with products shipping out either the same day or landing at your door within 24 hours. Whilst you don't get the same speedy shipment with TCGPlayer merchants, you're likely buying from them for the cheaper price points and big savings over big-box Amazon. Let's get into it:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Get 20% Off All eSIM Plans at Roamless</h2><p id="mtg-at-amazon"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG at Amazon">Cheapest at Amazon: MTG</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Commander Masters is the best set to get into if you love playing Commander and getting hold of legacy card reprints that are ideal for the format. It's not cheap, but Amazon currently has the best pricing for Set and Draft booster boxes.<br>If you missed out on the Final Fantasy Universes Beyond set when it dropped earlier this year, the game edition of Cloud Strife's Commander Deck, Limit Breaker, is at market value on Amazon right now. That just means you're getting it for a fair price compared to the secondary market, whilst being able to take advantage of that sweet Prime shipping.</p><p id="mtg-at-tcgplayer"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG at TCGPlayer">Cheapest at TCGPlayer - MTG</h2></p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>TCGPlayer is still holding the top spot for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Play Booster Box preorders. It's a full $20 cheaper from its merchants right now, a saving worth getting over Prime shipping. The same goes for the Lorwyn Eclipsed Play Booster Box, a full $30 cheaper over Amazon's price.</p><p>Fair enough, Amazon has its preorder price guarantee, but that only counts if they drop the price before release. You can't price match other retailers with this guarantee, so if you see a steep discount on a preorder elsewhere, take your chances.</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Get a Free Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2025) With Any Total Wireless Phone Plan</h2><div catalogid="36fb4e94-db7d-4377-a6ed-fd0e1f089967" id="233817"><p data-cy="paragraph">From now until January 7, or while supplies last, a Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2025) can be yours for no cost, and a trade-in isn’t required.</p></div><p id="amazon-pokemon-tcg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Amazon: Pokemon TCG">Cheapest at Amazon: Pokémon TCG</h2></p><div><div id="233887" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At Market Value at Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><div id="233888" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Surging Sparks Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><div id="233897" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Destined Rivals Three Booster Blister</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s great to see popular sets like <strong>Surging Sparks</strong> and <strong>Phantasmal Flames</strong> Elite Trainer Boxes crop up for less on Amazon, with the former being below market value alongside the <strong>Destined Rivals</strong> triple booster.</p><p id="tcgplayer-pokemon-tcg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TCGPlayer: Pokemon TCG">Cheapest at TCGPlayer: Pokémon TCG</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s strange to see <strong>Silver Tempest</strong> sealed product showing up on Amazon right now. Perhaps we’ll see more Sword &amp; Shield-era reprints on store shelves? Regardless, TCGPlayer has the <strong>Silver Tempest Elite Trainer Box</strong> for far less than Amazon, and the same goes for the <strong>Prismatic Evolutions ETB</strong>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPlayer also has the best deal on <strong>Destined Rivals Booster Bundles</strong>, currently sitting at $52.50. That means you get double the booster packs compared to the three-pack booster deal in the last section for less than double the price. TCGPlayer really has the no-brainer deals right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Scream (1996) Limited-Edition Steelbook (4K UHD) Available to Pre-order at 19% Off</h2><div catalogid="f13ad3e2-1b19-49d8-9f13-f6626458e491" id="233949"><div id="233949" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Scream (1996) Limited-Edition Steelbook (4K UHD)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is offering 19% off the Scream 4K UHD pre-order right now, set to release on February 17. A classic!</p></div><p id="skytech-gaming-pc-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Skytech Gaming PC Sale">Skytech Gaming PC Holiday Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering we’ve just entered a memory chip shortage across the board, with even DDR4 RAM going for silly money, getting an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-review">RTX 5060</a> build with 32GB DDR4 for $1,079 is a great deal. You’ll have solid 1080p gaming with either an Intel i5-14400F or AMD Ryzen 7 5700 processor to boot. Personally, I’d go for the <strong>Crystal</strong> build. It costs the same and gives you far more room for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-graphics-card">bigger GPU upgrades</a> down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking to go all-in with 4K gaming out of the box for under $3,000, the $2,799.99 <strong>Aqua</strong> build comes with a gorgeous clear white and blue case, complete with CPU liquid cooling, an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080</a>, 32GB DDR5, and the absolute beast that is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review">Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
