            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-player-hits-level-cap-before-the-opening-credits<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One dedicated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> player has hit the level cap before beginning The Heist mission, meaning before the opening credits have rolled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1gyno8j/level_50_before_the_heist_that_took_so_damn_long/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uO__Ou</a> shared their self-inflicted challenge, noting that it "took so damn long" while confirming a playtime of 40 hours and 30 minutes. Game tracking website <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/2127" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Long to Beat</a> pegs Cyberpunk 2077's entire main story at around 25 hours and 30 minutes in total, meaning the player spent more time in the opening area than it would take to actually complete the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077 opens with a handful of smaller missions before the crux of the story kicks off with The Heist. Per open-world game standards, it also limits players to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/Watson">the opening area of Watson</a> during this time, meaning just a fraction of the game's total activities (that award experience points) are available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">uO__Ou overcame this somewhat by using an exploit that allowed them to leave Watson. This doesn't activate the dozens of side quests or other open-world activities available in Cyberpunk 2077's Night City, but does offer better grinding locations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Go to Pacifica, Batty's Hotel for, in my experience, the best farming spot," uO__Ou said. "Repeat it over and over and over. Took me 40 hrs but, to be honest, if I did this more efficiently, it can take less than 35 hours. Just don't forget to sleep every hour for an experience boost and to use different weapons for your sanity and for skill progression."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077 uses a similar progression system to the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review">The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim</a>, where players can engage in different activities to level up specific skills which contribute to the overall level. Being stealthy and getting headshots, for example, upgrades the Headhunter skill, while crafting items upgrades the Engineer skill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">uO__Ou used these different skills to eventually reach the final Level 50, though it could have almost certainly been reached faster by actually progressing the main story. With developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-rules-out-cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch">CD Projekt Red now done with Cyberpunk 2077</a> and its expansion <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review">Phantom Liberty,</a> and focusing on a sequel codenamed Orion (and upcoming The Witcher games codenamed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-polaris-development-cd-projekt">Polaris</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-spin-off-project-sirius-has-a-new-framework-following-development-restart">Sirius</a>), however, fans are having to come up with quirky challenges like these to keep themselves entertained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Practically nothing is known about Orion so far, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-hires-veterans-from-mortal-kombat-diablo-control-and-more">CD Projekt Red is still in the process of creating a North American studio in Boston</a> to develop it. It has been called a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077 though, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2-may-have-grander-branching-storylines-based-on-players-starting-life-path">may feature more involved life paths</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-review">In our 9/10 review of Cyberpunk</a>, IGN said: "Cyberpunk 2077 throws you into a beautiful, dense cityscape and offers a staggering amount of flexibility in how you choose to take it from there."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-ciris-origin-story-getting-a-comic-adaptation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Horse is adapting another The Witcher short story from author Andrzej Sapkowski into a comic book, this time focusing on how fan-favorite character Ciri came to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Question of Price is the fourth short story adapted in The Last Wish collection, <a href="https://www.darkhorse.com/Books/3008-186/Andrzej-Sapkowskis-The-Witcher-A-Question-of-Price-HC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Horse</a> announced. The collection includes stories pulled from the first canonical The Witcher book, with this story explaining how protagonist Geralt of Rivia saved Ciri's father from the wrath of her grandmother.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Geralt is invited to a banquet at the Kingdom of Cintra," the synopsis reads. "The Princess has come of age and suitors prepare to present themselves for her hand in marriage. Wary of the Queenâ€™s invitation, Geralt attends the dinner with caution. When a mysterious uninvited guest, bearing the armor of a knight enters the hall, a bold declaration and a shocking revelation ignites the party into chaos and uproar."</p><output><figure><a href="https://d2lzb5v10mb0lj.cloudfront.net/covers/600/30/3008186.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A Question of Price from Dark Horse. Image credit: Dark Horse.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This will sound familiar to fans of The Witcher live action adaptation, as A Question of Price was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/23/netflixs-the-witcher-season-1-review-full-spoilers">adapted in Season 1 Episode 4</a> of the Henry Cavill-starring Netflix series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hardcover comic version, arriving in the same style as previous The Last Wish entries A Grain of Truth, The Lesser Evil, and The Edge of the World (which arrives January 16), releases on July 29 priced $17.99. This leaves just three short stories left to adapt from The Last Wish: Sapkowski's debut story The Witcher; the short story on which the collection was based, also called The Last Wish, and The Voice of Reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latter of these was told as an overarching story to introduce each separate short story, however, so it's unclear if Dark Horse will also adapt this one. There are plenty more short stories to adapt beyond The Last Wish though, namely from subsequent collection The Sword of Destiny.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Horse has a line of its own The Witcher stories too, which has released roughly once a year since The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was released in 2015. These are all set within the canon of CD Projekt Red's The Witcher world, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-corvo-bianco-comic-is-a-direct-sequel-to-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">some have even continued the story of Geralt, Yennefer, Ciri, and other beloved characters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
