            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-deals-today-pokmon-tcg-bundles-mass-effect-collectibles-and-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I think we can all agree the Pokémon TCG is a wallet-endangering hobby, but that doesn’t mean we have to overpay for cardboard. Amazon clearly got the memo because a bunch of solid bundles just dropped , including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">Journey Together</a> and Paldean Fates. If you’ve been telling yourself you’re just buying “a few packs for the kids,” this is your moment to stock up and pretend it’s not for you. I’m not judging. I’m doing the same thing.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Catch Surging Sparks, Journey Together and Paldean Fates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also want to point out the Mass Effect statues in the IGN Store, because apparently my bookshelf wasn’t crowded enough with plastic space heroes. Commander Shepard and crew are up for pre-order, and yes, I already added Jack to my cart because I enjoy chaos. There’s also a Humble Bundle packed with narrative indies that scream “you have emotions, deal with them.” All in all, it’s a good day to make impulsive but justifiable purchases.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-surg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surg">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218606"><div id="218606" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up Surging Sparks because six booster packs under $50 is lower than what Amazon has been charging recently (It's still above MSRP though) Honestly, I wanted something new to crack open. It’s part of the latest Scarlet &amp; Violet expansion, so if you’re trying to keep up with current sets or just enjoy the chaos of pulling a good card, this one’s a smart grab.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-ionos-bellibolt-ex-pre"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Pre">Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218607"><div id="218607" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one’s for the collectors who care as much about presentation as they do the pulls. Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection comes with six packs, a full-art promo, and a display sheet that’s more elaborate than it needs to be — in a good way. It's also a cool way to snag Journey Together packs with a fantastic promo card.</p></div><p id="mass-effect-merchandise"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mass Effect Merchandise">Mass Effect Merchandise</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218608"><div id="218608" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mass Effect Merchandise</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think anyone who's replayed Mass Effect more than once knows exactly why these statues are tempting. I pre-ordered Jack immediately because, well, it felt necessary. The line includes Shepard, Tali, Legion, and others, and they look good enough that I’ve already made space for them on the shelf. If you're still quoting Garrus unironically, these are for you.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-pa"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Pa"> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Paldean Fates: Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218609"><div id="218609" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Paldean Fates: Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Paldean Fates is priced a double MSRP, but it's also very hard to come by in 2025. I grabbed it because the baby shiny sub-set is awesome, but if you just want to grab the single cards from this set, it might actually save you money.</p></div><p id="fellow-traveller-publisher-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fellow Traveller Publisher Bundle">Fellow Traveller Publisher Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218610"><div id="218610" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fellow Traveller Publisher Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pay less to get fewer items, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity One Tree Planted</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle has some of the better narrative indies from the last few years. I paid the $12, added the games to my backlog like I always do, and immediately booted up The Pale Beyond. It’s a strong lineup if you like character-driven games and don’t mind occasionally being emotionally wrecked by minimalist storytelling.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-shr"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shr"> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218611"><div id="218611" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think of this one as the all-in-one box for when you want cards <em>and</em> a bunch of gear you probably won’t use but still want around. Nine booster packs, a promo, sleeves, dice, and enough extras to make you feel like you’re doing more than just opening packs. It’s a solid option if you like having a little structure with your chaos.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-terapagos-ex-ultra-pre"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Pre"> Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218612"><div id="218612" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I hesitated on this one, then immediately remembered it includes 18 booster packs and a playmat. It’s definitely a big spend, but if you’ve been waiting for a premium bundle that actually justifies the price, this checks out. I picked it up more for the experience than the individual cards, and that’s the right way to approach it.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-shining-fates-collectio"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collectio">Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218613"><div id="218613" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I grabbed Shining Fates Pikachu V mostly because I never actually opened it when it first dropped, and now seemed like a good excuse. Four booster packs, a Pikachu promo, and the oversized card that ends up somewhere near your desk — standard stuff, but still a nice throwback if you missed it the first time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
