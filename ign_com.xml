In a new interview, we're now learning much more about FromSoft's plans for this multiplayer experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo posted a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three-part interview series</a> with The Duskbloods director Hidetaka Miyazaki, going over what The Duskbloods is, and how it's different from other FromSoftware games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the multiplayer PvPvE focus, Miyazaki has assured fans that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-director-miyazaki-reassures-fans-that-fromsoftware-will-still-actively-develop-single-player-focused-games-despite-online-multiplayer-the-duskbloods">FromSoftware will keep making single-player focused games</a>. But with The Duskbloods, the studio is experimenting, with everything from general game type to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods-hub-keeper-is-something-cute-for-a-change-because-of-its-partnership-with-nintendo">having a cute hub keeper</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are some of the major takeaways we've learned about The Duskbloods from this new set of interviews.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The meaning of 'The Duskbloods'</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While the name, aesthetic, and constant mention of blood might bring to mind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bloodborne">another FromSoftware title</a>, Miyazaki said The Duskbloods refers to the Bloodsworn themselves. These Bloodsworn—the characters players control—are people who have achieved superhuman abilities through special blood, similar to vampires.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We tried to extract the sort of romantic aspects we found interesting from concepts such as vampires and 'blood' and reinterpreted them as the Bloodsworn," Miyazaki said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Duskblood is a collective term for these characters, who all partake in a bid for First Blood, which flows during an event known as the "Twilight of Humanity."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">There's no set time or place for The Duskbloods</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Because the Twilight of Humanity takes place across different times and locales, there is no "fixed era or location" to pin down when or where The Duskbloods takes place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are more traditional Gothic- or Victorian-style maps as well as those depicting the closing years of the early modern period, like the one glimpsed in the trailer with the train running through it," Miyazaki said.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">You can choose between different characters</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In a manner that sounds similar to the upcoming Elden Ring Nightreign, players can choose from "over a dozen" characters in The Duskbloods. Each character can also be customized, and you'll swap between those options in a main hub area.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 - The Duskbloods</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While characters will each have their own abilities, it sounds like some skills are universal. The Bloodsworn fighters are essentially superhuman, so they can sprint, super jump, and double jump. Additionally, every character is equipped with "some means of attacking from a distance," which Miyazaki said he feels is one of The Duskblood's "unique aspects" when compared with previous FromSoftware games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Progression doesn't rely solely on victory</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A key component of The Duskbloods is the PvPvE set-up. Online matches support up to eight players, vying for a win. Miyazaki said online matches are "generally" last player standing, but there are "certain cases where victory conditions differ." He gave the example of players being tasked with teaming up to take down a powerful boss, or "other special circumstances."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Regardless of whether it’s PvP or PvE, the idea is to provide players with an experience that allows them to learn and hone their skills as they play," Miyazaki said. "We’ve therefore designed the PvE boss encounters to present a tough challenge and a sense of accomplishment upon defeating them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obtaining "Victory Points," which ultimately decide the outcome of a match, can happen in a few different ways. Direct combat is one, but engaging in more "opportunistic behavior" is also an option. And Miyazaki noted that when players return to the hub after a match, they receive a reward whether they won or lost.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Events can shake up the match</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There will be world events through the event system, which has the potential to shake up a match. This can range from special enemy spawns to additional objectives, all with bonus rewards offered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Miyazaki drew attention to a portion of The Duskbloods trailer, where a giant stone face loomed in the sky. "This is one example of the events that can occur in a match," Miyazaki said. "In this case, the appearance of this stone face affects the environment and changes match rewards, which can have an immediate impact on player motivations and objectives."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Players will have personal objectives and roles, too</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While First Blood is something worth chasing, Miyazaki said there will also be "personal objectives" to provide separate rewards for players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear whether these fully tie into another system Miyazaki also mentioned, called "roles." While online, roles offer players unique circumstances and opportunities to interact with each other. He outlined a few examples, like the "Destined Rival," which tasks a player with finding and defeating another player. Doing this will count as a personal goal, separate from the overall victory conditions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roles can be assigned to characters through customization, so players can roleplay a bit and, as Miyazaki said, add to the "drama" of these engagements.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lore will be delived through customization</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">FromSoftware is no stranger to putting some deep lore in its games. And there will, of course, be lore in The Duskbloods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"One thing I love doing in any game I direct is leaving fragments of lore and worldbuilding details, allowing the player the fun of using their imagination to make connections," Miyazaki said. "The Duskbloods is no exception to this."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, for The Duskbloods, Miyazaki said the team is going about it a little differently from previous games. Fragments are found in character customization items, the "blood history and fate." Customizing characters, analyzing and altering their blood history and fate, will reveal more information about the world and its story.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Focusing these elements on the concept of 'blood' or 'blood history and fate' allowed for a deeper exploration of customization and is another reason we placed the Bloodsworn as the protagonists," Miyazaki said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FromSoftware is certainly painting an interesting picture, but we'll have to wait a little bit to see the image fully realized, as The Duskbloods is currently planned to be a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive sometime in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, you can check out more info about the Switch 2 by reading over our first-hands on with Nintendo's newest console, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-order-date-in-the-us-to-assess-impact-of-trumps-tariffs">read up on the sudden delay of Switch 2 pre-orders here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo did not share an updated kick-off date, but did promise that the June 5, 2025 release date of the Switch 2 itself remains intact.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo issued IGN the following statement:</p><blockquote>Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has confirmed the pre-order delay is specific to the U.S. In the UK, for example, Nintendo's pre-order delay remains unchanged.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-price-confirmed">Nintendo announced the Switch 2 at $449.99</a>, with a Mario Kart World bundle priced $499.99. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-costs-80-30-cheaper-if-you-buy-it-bundled-with-the-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World itself is priced $79.99</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch 2 comes with the following:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nintendo Switch 2 console</li><li>Joy-Con 2 controllers (L+R)</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Grip</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Straps</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Dock</li><li>Ultra High-Speed HDMI Cable</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter</li><li>USB-C Charging Cable</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s statement issued today raises the prospect that it could hike the price of the Switch 2 and its games further amid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-nintendo-pr-managers-say-switch-2-and-mario-kart-world-price-backlash-a-true-crisis-moment-for-nintendo">what is already an angry backlash to its next-gen pricing strategy</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking in <a href="https://youtu.be/jMibVyYvSYU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a video on their YouTube channel</a>, former Nintendo of America PR managers Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang criticized Nintendo for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-price-confirmed">the way it revealed the $449.99 price of the Switch 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-costs-80-30-cheaper-if-you-buy-it-bundled-with-the-nintendo-switch-2">the $79.99 price of Mario Kart World</a> following this week's Nintendo Direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t want to blow things out of proportion, but this does feel like a true crisis moment for Nintendo,” Ellis said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">U.S. markets tumbled today after China hit back against Donald Trump's raft of tariffs. China, which faces a 54% import tax, has retaliated with an additional 34% tax on U.S. goods from next week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moments before the U.S. markets opened, Trump said "China played it wrong, they panicked," and insisted his policies would "never change."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The world is now left facing economic uncertainty, with some mainstream news media declaring the era of cheap goods now over for the American consumer as higher tariffs are automatically passed through to inflation and higher prices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tariffs are essentially taxes placed on the cost of importing certain goods. While it's possible for companies in the supply chain to simply eat these costs, more often than not these taxes are passed onto consumers. And unfortunately for gamers, rising prices are very likely to impact tech and gaming goods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-take-on-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad had warned</a> that Trump's surprise tariffs on countries such as Vietnam, where Nintendo had shifted some of its Switch 2 manufacturing in anticipation of U.S. tariffs on China, might have caused a rethink.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset U.S. tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the Switch 2 showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world," Ahmad said. "The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced"><u>everything announced at the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive"><u>what the experts have to say about the Switch 2 price and Mario Kart World’s $80 price tag</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
