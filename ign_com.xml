            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Lily James stars in this thin but shiny look at dating app pioneer Whitney Wolfe Herd.</h2></div><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Swiped is now available to stream on Hulu in the United States.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As an installment in her filmography, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/swiped">Swiped</a> represents a major leap forward for director Rachel Lee Goldenberg. Coming up from direct-to-video entries for The Asylum and made-for-TV Lifetime movies, Goldenberg launched two more prominent features in 2020 with Valley Girl and Unpregnant, only for their rollouts to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Five years later, she now has Disney money to spend (although under the 20th Century Studios name) with Swiped, certainly her most high profile project yet, garnering a Toronto Film Festival premiere before launching on Hulu and Disney+ worldwide. However, the end result is a decent film that could have been stronger if it were willing to take as many risks as its subject.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Swiped Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Swiped tells the story of Whitney Wolfe (she took the name Herd after marrying Michael Herd in 2017), famous for her integral role in Tinder’s rise and also for being the founder and CEO of Bumble. As a key player in the creation of two of the biggest dating apps in existence, it’s not unfair to say that Wolfe has had an astronomical impact on worldwide culture, especially with a younger generation who have had their entire dating life filtered through the presence of such apps. Yet you might not get the full sense of that impact by watching Swiped, which focuses more on the micro consequences in regards to Wolfe’s personal history with the companies, in particular her sexual harassment suit against her former colleagues at Tinder and her subsequent reemergence as the head of Bumble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The dramatic arc of Wolfe’s rise, downfall and eventual return to prominence certainly makes for an easy enough three act structure, but it also makes Swiped into a movie too basic to do its subject justice. It’s an interesting story on its own merits, and certainly reflects the toxic and misogynistic tendencies of technology company culture. Yet if Wolfe is made undoubtedly sympathetic because of the way her cohorts treat her as she fights to make a name for herself in a male-dominated workspace, the movie never turns enough of a critical eye on Wolfe herself to make her three-dimensional. Swiped’s Whitney Wolfe is a relatable figure because of her struggles, but she never becomes a rounded figure because of her choices.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Swiped is a movie too basic to do its subject justice.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not for lack of trying on the acting front, though. Lily James, of Cinderella and Baby Driver fame, has been an underappreciated actor for years, and turns in a performance that’s better than the script deserves. James’ most compelling attribute, present both on screen and stage (shout-out to her excellent work as Eve Harrington in Ivo van Hove’s 2019 production of All About Eve), is her ability to stealthily take over a scene with small gestures that eventually coalesce into a bigger moment later on. That ability to disarm the audience to produce pathos is what makes her so charming to watch, yet the depth she tries to add to her take on Wolfe isn’t always backed up by the writing. We understand by watching her why she’s good at persuading people to try her products, but charm can only take a character so far when there are reasons to treat her with skepticism.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This becomes a problem when the movie feels obligated to give Wolfe a “dark night of the soul” beat that isn't earned. Although one of Goldenberg’s best directorial touches is how she assembles a frantic montage of Wolfe’s life falling apart through her phone as she becomes the internet’s punching bag of the moment after the sexual harassment suit, this is followed up with Wolfe meeting with former work friend Tisha (Myha’la), who tells her that Wolfe didn’t do enough to help the other women in the office after she earned her co-founder status. James’ furious response to this (and the inherent racial dynamic of a white woman snapping at a Black woman who’s trying to hold her accountable for her actions) is one of the movie’s best moments because it feels emotionally honest about Wolfe’s failings while not taking away from the very real abuse that Wolfe suffered.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/19/lily-james-swiped-1758318606885.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lily James stars as Whitney Wolfe in Swiped.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But instead of unraveling this thread for more substance, Wolfe and Tisha reconcile in their next encounter after a hasty apology, and Wolfe is restored to her “forward-minded feminist tech leader” status with nary a further mention of any wrongdoing. That the movie then mostly skips over the actual development of Bumble, going from shoebox operation to 35 million-user app in basically one scene transition, only makes this issue worse. This was the era where Wolfe developed the foundation of her personal fortune, which would make her a billionaire by the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2021/02/11/bumble-founder-whitney-wolfe-herds-fortune-rockets-past-1-billion-as-dating-app-goes-public/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>age of 31</u></a>. Nobody amasses that kind of money without making serious compromises along the way, but the movie presents Wolfe’s ascension as an easy enough matter because, well, a woman did it this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The movie also never grapples with the fact that Wolfe’s impact on the world at large could arguably be considered a net negative. Sure, many couples have connected through dating apps, but said apps have also heavily commodified the very concept of meeting potential romantic partners, turning judging others based on a few seconds of visual impression into a gamified and monetized nightmare for many hapless users. Wolfe had a direct hand in creating this state of affairs, but Swiped never considers that worth examining. It’s a shame, because a better movie would have trusted its audience to make their own judgments of Wolfe based on a fuller account of her actions, instead of prescribing how it wants its viewers to feel.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Swiped is constructed well-enough for the movie it’s trying to be, but its lack of ambition and nuance keep it from being its best self. It can still be a worthwhile enough watch for Lily James’ admirable performance as Whitney Wolfe, but the movie never affords its subject the same level of depth as what James tries to imbue her with.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="article-subtitle">Not yet available for streaming.</p></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-review-title">Swiped Review</h3><div data-cy="review-content"><p>okay</p><p>Swiped is a decent biopic on a craft level, but it never reaches its full potential beyond a strong lead performance from Lily James.</p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/swiped-movie-review-lily-james-whitney-wolfe-herd]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As avid puzzlers know full well, the humble jigsaw puzzle is a thing of beauty in multiple ways. Not only are jigsaws an absorbing time sink, but multiple <a href="https://blogs.bcm.edu/2020/10/29/a-perfect-match-the-health-benefits-of-jigsaw-puzzles/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies have demonstrated</a> they are good for you both mentally and physically. As you fit the pieces into place, they can be enjoyed alone or as a communal activity, and remain to be a fun hobby for all ages. Plus, when you’re finished, you’re often left with a delightful piece of art and sense of accomplishment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only downside to puzzles is they can take up a surprising amount of space, especially puzzles with 1000+ pieces. If you get into working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/largest-jigsaw-puzzles">bigger puzzles</a>, they can eat up your dining room table, coffee table or desk space for long stretches of time. This is why many jigsaw fans have a dedicated puzzle-solving table or board these days, often equipped with useful accessories. You have foldable and portable options, multi-purpose tables (for playing cards and the like), and ones with drawers to organize the pieces as you go. No matter what you're looking for or what your budget is, we've found some viable options for you below.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">TL;DR: These Are the Best Puzzle Tables and Boards</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve got the puzzle bug or simply want an easier setup for regular puzzling, below are our top puzzle table and board picks right now to solve your space and storage problems, no matter your budget. Each of our picks represent a different category of table or board to fit different jigsaw puzzle needs. There are a lot of different options to choose from within these categories, so we've narrowed it down to one entry for each that we think fits the category best.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="bits-and-pieces">1. Bits and Pieces Fold and Go Table</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best for portability</h3><div catalogid="e7adf963-6ce1-4d39-aa82-8e8cf6a2bcd7" id="214828"><div id="214828" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bits and Pieces Fold-and-Go Wooden Jigsaw Puzzle Table</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This <a href="https://www.bitsandpieces.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorALjfg68C2gxeRGsics57Sap_amx4sJCjMnSZ1WATiMrbMDrth" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bits and Pieces</a> puzzle table has it all in one convenient package that can be easily moved around. It stores completely flat but extends into a good-sized table with fold-out legs and a felt covering to make it easy to pick up and push in pieces. The side arms can be used to arrange pieces you have yet to fit into the main puzzle, giving you plenty of room to work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because it stores flat, it also functions as a puzzle protector, allowing you to fold the flaps inward to cover your work in progress. It can then be slid conveniently under furniture until you’re ready to dive in again. And if you like puzzling on the go, this table’s lightweight and has a carry handle. As a bonus, this table is multi-purpose for card games, reading, writing and the like. It's a great portable puzzle table that is built to handle up to 1500 piece jigsaw puzzles.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="vociprooter">2. Vociprooter Puzzle Board</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best for laps</h3></div><div catalogid="e7adf963-6ce1-4d39-aa82-8e8cf6a2bcd7" id="214829"><div id="214829" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Vociprooter Jigsaw Puzzle Board</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Some puzzlers prefer the comfort of working from their laps on a favorite chair or sofa, but that can be almost impossible with larger puzzles. To solve this problem, consider one of these handy puzzle folders which offer a hard surface you can spread out and balance on your knees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The wings offer trays to put puzzle pieces on while you’re still working. When you want to finish a session, you can move the trays into the center and zip the wings closed to seal the puzzle. It can then be tucked away out of sight until you’re ready to carry on. This handy design comes in a variety of sizes to suit your puzzling preferences.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Jigitz Puzzle Spinner</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best for collaborative puzzling</h3></div><div catalogid="e7adf963-6ce1-4d39-aa82-8e8cf6a2bcd7" id="214830"><div id="214830" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Jigitz Jigsaw Puzzle Spinner</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Great for puzzles and board games.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Having a lazy susan for your jigsaw puzzle is such a great idea it’s surprising more companies haven’t put one on the market. If you’re puzzling with friends it’s much more convenient to reach the piece you’re working on. If you’re puzzling alone, it lets you easily access every side of the puzzle without having to leave your spot, as well as try different angles to see if a new perspective sparks a new idea for a match between possible pieces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This particular Jigitz spinning table topper comes with a felt backing for convenience, a hardwood rim, and can hold puzzles up to 34” x 34” (which should cover most 1000 piece puzzles). And if you’re into jigsaws of different shapes, there’s a <a href="https://zdcs.link/YBpGr?object_uuid=1d7bfb97-f8ca-443f-8546-51315d70dbc9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">circular option</a> from the same manufacturer, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to puzzle use, this spinning board is also excellent for playing board games like Scrabble where rotating the board is quite useful. Though a dedicated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-table">board game table</a> is still worthwhile if you are looking to mostly use it for that.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Jumbl 1000-Piece Puzzle Board Rack</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best for storing pieces</h3></div><div catalogid="e7adf963-6ce1-4d39-aa82-8e8cf6a2bcd7" id="214831"><div id="214831" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Jumbl 1000-Piece Puzzle Table</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Great for puzzle organization.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s another full puzzle table with fold-out legs for your consideration. From Jumbl, this table’s a little bulkier than some others on this list, but that’s because it comes with a hidden benefit: slide-out drawers to store your puzzle pieces. Anything you're currently clueless about can be hidden away until you’re ready, as can part-finished sections that aren’t quite ready to join the main puzzle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The table is thoughtfully designed in a number of other respects, from the attractive varnished finish to the two-sided rail that gives you clear access from different angles while keeping the puzzle in place. And if you don’t need it freestanding, it’s thin enough to sit conveniently on a tabletop or other surface.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This particular puzzle table is only meant to handle up to 1000-piece puzzles, but with the addition of the drawers, it should be able to scale up to 1500 pieces or more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="playvibe">5. Playvibe Puzzle Board</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best table topper</h3></div><div catalogid="e7adf963-6ce1-4d39-aa82-8e8cf6a2bcd7" id="214832"><div id="214832" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PlayVibe Puzzle Locker</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Works great for puzzles up to 1500 pieces.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Our previous recommendation will sit atop a table, but it’s a little bulky should that be your primary mode of play. This one, from Playvibe, is a dedicated, slimline table-topper with felt feet to grip surfaces and six handy drawers to help store and organize your pieces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fully enclosed edging helps keep your puzzle secure, and the board comes with an acetate cover that fits between the rails to protect half-finished segments when not in use. It’s also made of lightweight wood, so it’s sturdy but still easy to move around from surface to surface as it suits you. </p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="all4jig">6. All4Jig Tilting Puzzle Table</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best dedicated tilting table</h3></div><div catalogid="e7adf963-6ce1-4d39-aa82-8e8cf6a2bcd7" id="214833"><div id="214833" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>All4Jig 1500 Piece Adjustable Puzzle Board</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>You can adjust the angle and height.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Regular puzzle players will be familiar with the postural problems that can arise from being bent over a surface for a long stretch. If that’s a problem for you, then the answer might be a tilting table like this one from <a href="https://all4jig.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALL4JIG</a> that leans toward you from different angles, allowing you to sit back and relax in a comfy seat while enjoying your puzzle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The board has a thick lower lip designed to keep a separate puzzling board in place, but you can play directly on the table’s surface if desired. It’s on wheels, so you can maneuver it into position around your seat, and it comes in a neat wood laminate finish.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="becko">7. Becko Angle Puzzle Board</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best table topper that tilts</h3></div><div catalogid="e7adf963-6ce1-4d39-aa82-8e8cf6a2bcd7" id="214834"><div id="214834" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Best Tilting Table Topper</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Becko Adjustable Puzzle Board</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Includes two adjustable amgles.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A table that tilts toward you as you play is obviously useful, but some players don’t want a whole table to do that, only a stand-alone board. This table from <a href="https://www.ibecko.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Becko</a> offers that convenience in a particularly solid and useful package with a natural pine wood frame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been thoughtfully designed, with a flannelette (like flannel, but not quite) surface to grip and sort your pieces, while the supplied bracket gives you a choice of angles and can actually be used with other boards. So it’s super useful if you’ve got more than one puzzle on the go at once.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Puzzle Board FAQs</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Puzzle Mats vs Puzzle Boards: Which is better?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Puzzle boards and puzzle mats are both tools avid puzzlers can use to organize their workspace and keep track of pieces. If you're looking to buy either as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-gifts">gift for the puzzler in your life</a>, there are a few things to consider/</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boards are more expensive but offer more features, like pullout trays and other storage options, that help puzzlers organize their projects. The main benefit of a puzzle board is stability, as these boards are typically made from wood and offer a sturdy, flat surface. While they may take up more space, an in-progress or completed puzzle can still be safely moved between locations on a wooden puzzle board. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Puzzle mats are a cheaper and more lightweight alternative to puzzle boards. Mats, usually made with felt, can be rolled up and stowed away. Putting away a mat may be easier than finding a space for a full-blown board, but these mats are also flimsier. Pieces may not stay together as firmly on a softer surface, and there are no additional storage features to keep track of them. While mats help puzzlers establish a clear workspace, they require an existing flat surface for stability. </p></div><div catalogid="c533fd11-45af-41af-83ff-0a1bd409483c" id="214947"><div id="214947" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Becko Puzzle Mat</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">What is the best size for a puzzle board?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">When researching puzzle boards, consider the amount of space available to you as well as the size of puzzles you like to put together. Many boards indicate what size puzzles they work best for, and some even have dimensions for different puzzles drawn out on their surface.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most puzzle boards range from about 27 to 35 inches in length. A 30" x 22" puzzle board can comfortably fit most 1000 piece puzzles, though daring puzzlers who tackle more than 1500 or 2000 pieces at a time may need a board closer to 35 inches long. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You may need to pick a specific space in your home to dedicate to a puzzle board. Alternatively, you may look into puzzle mats or foldable puzzle tables that can be stored when not in use. All in all, the ideal size for a puzzle board is what will support your favorite puzzles without dominating your space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>For more, check out the </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzles-for-adults"><strong>10 best puzzles</strong></a><strong> for adults right now and the </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">b<strong>est jigsaw puzzle brands</strong></a><strong> for all ages!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance board game and video game writer for IGN.
