That‚Äôs enough to make it the sixth most-played game on Steam right now. Only Delta force, Battlefield 6, PUBG, Dota 2, and Counter-Strike 2 are more popular right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Escape from Duckov is a PVE top-down looter-shooter game in which you scavenge for resources, build your hideout, and upgrade your gear. ‚ÄúStart from nothing and rise to the top,‚Äù reads the official blurb. ‚ÄúOutwit hostile ducks, survive, or make it out alive.‚Äù</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following its launch on October 16, Team Soda‚Äôs game sold an additional 500,000 copies over the weekend. Its Steam user review rating is sitting pretty at 'Overwhelmingly Positive.' ‚ÄúAt this moment, the entire dev team is quacking with joy and flapping our wings in excitement!‚Äù reads a statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Escape from Tarkov, meanwhile, hits Steam on November 15. It will be interesting to see if it beats Escape from Duckov‚Äôs concurrent player peak on the platform. A console version is in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Extraction shooters might be having a moment, particularly on PC. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-ends-server-slam-playtest-with-big-steam-concurrents-suggesting-strong-launch-ahead">Arc Raiders, for example, recently enjoyed big Steam concurrents during its 'Server Slam' playtest</a>, which bodes well for its late October release date. Then we'll have Escape from Tarkov join the fun half a month later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

He marked the news by sharing a photo of his own sleeping dog. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">in honour of our sleeping dogs script draft being done, here‚Äôs my sleepy dog üëç <a href="https://t.co/l1KsFNDj5V" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/l1KsFNDj5V</a></p>‚Äî Simu Liu (@SimuLiu) <a href="https://twitter.com/SimuLiu/status/1979664278459388314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">When a commenter responded to the good news and asked if the actor and producer had "worked things out" with the game's publisher and IP-holder Square Enix, Liu <a href="https://x.com/SimuLiu/status/1979666037391147276" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>: "They‚Äôre absolutely great, it‚Äôs the studios that don‚Äôt seem to understand how important this IP is BUT we will get them there."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you were hoping for more, I'm afraid Liu shared little else, but it should be good news nonetheless given the adaptation has been languishing in development hell for at least eight years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sleeping-dogs-movie-is-in-development-and-were-hearing-shang-chi-star-simu-liu-is-set-to-play-wei-shen">As IGN has reported</a>, Story Kitchen is leading the Sleeping Dogs live action feature film project, with Simu Liu, who plays Shang-Chi in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings">Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</a>, producing and set to play the lead role of Wei Shen. Story Kitchen has form when it comes to video game adaptations, having worked on everything from the Sonic the Hedgehog films to Netflix‚Äôs animated Tomb Raider series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/03/donnie-yen-to-star-in-sleeping-dogs-video-game-adaptation"><u>The original adaptation was announced in 2017</u></a> with Donnie Yen set to star, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/05/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-confirms-its-still-in-production"><u>the film disappeared a year later</u></a> and, earlier this year, Yen himself confirmed it had been scrapped, saying: "I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work with these producers, and I even invested some of my own money into obtaining the drafts and some of the rights." Just a few weeks later, however, Liu tweeted to say <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-star-simu-liu-says-hes-working-to-get-sleeping-dogs-a-film-adaptation"><u>he was working with the rights holders to bring the much-loved video game to the big screen</u></a>. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: Who's Who in the Cast</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sleeping Dogs was first released in 2012 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC and tells the story of detective Wei Shen as he infiltrates one of Hong Kong's notorious Triad crime syndicates. While it failed to meet publisher Square Enix's lofty sales expectations, it is much-loved by fans and sequel hopes have followed it ever since. We thought Sleeping Dogs was great, writing in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/08/sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition-review"><u>IGN's Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition review</u></a>: "Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition doesn't mess much with what made the original game so great.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom's upcoming, unannounced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-zero-hd">Resident Evil Zero</a> remake will reportedly launch in 2028 and feature the lead actor from Square Enix's Guardians of the Galaxy video game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, IGN verified a report by noted Resident Evil leaker Dusk Golem that claimed Capcom would continue remaking its classic Resident Evil back catalog with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-remakes-reportedly-in-the-works-at-capcom">new versions of both Resident Evil Code Veronica and Resident Evil Zero in development</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-resident-evil-0-remake-in-development-new-casting-and-plot-details-unearthed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MP1st</a> has suggested that the Code Veronica remake is targeting a Q1 2027 release window, while Resident Evil Zero will follow a year after. And there's word, too, of Zero remake's codename ‚Äî "Project Chamber" ‚Äî which is also listed on the <a href="https://resumes.actorsaccess.com/jonmclaren" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resume</a> of Far Cry 5 and Guardians of the Galaxy (video game) actor Jon McLaren.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">McLaren's resume describes Project Chamber as an "upcoming AAA video game", for which he is providing performance capture at Beyond Capture Studios. The codename would be an obvious nod to Resident Evil Zero's Rebecca Chambers, while MP1st notes that Beyond Capture Studios was previously used by Capcom for both the Resident Evil 4 Remake and Street Fighter 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Zero originally launched in 2002 on GameCube, and served as a prequel to franchise's classic first entry. It covers the events surrounding the S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team in the Arklay Mountains, with the player switching between Chambers and escaped convict Billy Coen. (This is, presumably, who McLaren is playing.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new remake is expected to add fresh scenes to the original game's story ‚Äî in a similar manner to how Capcom has fleshed out its previous Resident Evil remakes. In Zero, it's reported that this will include a larger role for the conductor in the game's infamous train sequence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's likely still plenty of time to go before fans see anything of Capcom's new Resident Evil Zero remake for themselves, though today's fresh report provides a little more detail of what to expect ‚Äî and when. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, of course, Capcom is busy getting ready for the launch of next year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> ‚Äî which is set to arrive on February 27, 2026 in time for the franchise's 30th anniversary. The game is designed to act as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade-resident-evil-requiem-will-return-to-franchises-original-overarching-narrative-featuring-raccoon-city-and-umbrella">something of a send-off for some of the series' long-running plotlines</a>, including the fate of the Umbrella Corporation and Raccoon City. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-resident-evil-requiem-interview-why-the-games-monster-got-supersized-why-its-probably-not-lisa-trevor-and-a-tease-for-areas-beyond-raccoon-city-just-dont-talk-about-leon">But will Leon S.

Asked if he agreed with the feedback that "certain sections" in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a> felt a little long, he disagreed, saying: "Regarding time management in certain sections, especially in FF7 Rebirth, I honestly don‚Äôt believe that they were longer than necessary. I feel like nowadays, players just have too much to do and too much to play; so they often feel the urge that something has to be concluded quickly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, Hamaguchi is at least mindful of the criticism, adding: "As we work on the conclusion to the trilogy, we are striking a balance on how story arcs are told and spread out so as to ensure that the game feels a bit more concise."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same interview, Hamaguchi ‚Äî who was inspired to become a developer after playing 1994's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vi"><u>Final Fantasy VI</u></a> ‚Äî spoke of other games that have provided inspiration, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt"><u>The Witcher series</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fable"><u>Fable</u></a>. He's particularly taken with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei"><u>Ghost of Yotei</u></a> at the moment, admitting: "I can't wait to get home to continue playing it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RPG fans have been on the hunt for news about the next entry in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy since its last installment, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a>, launched in early 2024. We know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-in-development"><u>development started as early as June 2022</u></a>, with Square Enix saying last year that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-hoping-to-release-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-finale-by-2027"><u>its goal was to see it launch by 2027</u></a>.
