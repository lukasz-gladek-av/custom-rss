Patch 01.003.000 is out now across PC and PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following a number of teases from developer Arrowhead, Helldivers 2 has unleashed a new invasion push from the Illuminate alien faction. This brings with it new enemies, as detailed on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, including the Stingray (jetfighters that provide Illuminate support from the sky, targeting Helldivers and lining up devastating strafing runs), and the Crescent Overseer, which has the ability to lay barrages on Helldivers in cover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also the Fleshmob, which is described as a “failed” Illuminate experiment: “a Frankenstein’s monster of Voteless parts turned into a brute battlefield force that the Helldivers must work hard to destroy.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Attention, Helldivers: This is a Galactic Emergency.</p><p>The true Illuminate invasion has begun. In a sudden and completely unprovoked offensive manoeuvre, the full Illuminate fleet is emerging from the Meridia Singularity. Nothing is safe - not even the Heart of Democracy itself. <a href="https://t.co/2hgtK6akMb" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2hgtK6akMb</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1922215852037783771?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead teased “sightings of other, even larger ships, though details remain unclear on their abilities.” So perhaps there will be more for players to discover once they jump into the game.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/54507366342-1ca82333da-h-1747129689963.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Helldivers 2 now has weapon customization and progression. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Helldivers 2 now has weapon customization and progression for the first time. Now, most primary weapons have levels that are achievable by completing missions, which then in turn unlock new attachments obtainable through Requisition. In addition to attachments, players can also unlock patterns for their weapons. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Whether it's tweaking sights for precision, changing color patterns, adjusting magazines for ammo capacity, muzzles to optimize weapon performance characteristics or adjusting under-barrel attachments for the handling you want, you're in command of how your weaponry performs on the battlefield. This level of individual attunement is sure to make your favorite primary best in its class.</blockquote><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/hd2-1747129737498.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead has also unlocked and deployed a stash of patterns for the FRV themed on the Viper Commandos, Freedom's Flame, Chemical Agents, and Truth Enforcers Warbonds. This backlog of patterns unlock on May 15, with the launch of the Masters of Ceremony Warbond.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/086ad5db38d420a0982fd909484ab56747c929ac-1747130320086.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, the Superstore has been changed so items you want are always available, as opposed to players having to wait for items to come back into rotation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside new features, patch 01.003.000 brings with it an extensive balance pass, with changes to spread, drag, sway, melee weapons stamina cost, shrapnel spawning, and fire damage. Check out the patch notes in full below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Helldivers 2 update 01.003.000 patch ntoes:</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">Overview</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>New Illuminate faction enemies</li><li>New Weapon Customizations and Progression</li><li>Crash fixes</li><li>Weapon fixes</li><li>Miscellaneous fixes</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">📍 Major Update</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Weapon Customization Gear up, Helldivers — your arsenal just got personal! With the new Weapon Customization system, you can now tailor your favorite weapons to match your combat style and preferences once you’ve progressed and unlocked different attachments. Whether it's tweaking sights for precision, changing color patterns, adjusting magazines for ammo capacity, muzzles to optimize weapon performance characteristics or adjusting underbarrels for the handling you want, you're in command of how your weaponry performs on the battlefield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tinker in the menu, customize your specific weapon configs and switch between them during the mission loadout sequence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's time to fight for Super Earth with weapons that are truly yours!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We are aware of a bug that prevents players from canceling customization with a controller. We have a fix identified and prepared for our next hotfix. In the meantime, you can save the customization and then go in and do it again.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">🦑 New Illuminate Enemies</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">**Stingray: ** Jetfighters that provide Illuminate support from the sky, targeting Helldivers and lining up devastating strafing runs. **Crescent Overseer: ** Has the ability to lay barrages on Helldivers in cover. <strong>Fleshmob:</strong> A failed Illuminate experiment made up of Voteless parts turned into a brute battlefield force that the Helldivers must work hard to destroy.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">⚖️ Balancing</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Weapon balances:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spread</li><li>Drag</li><li>Sway</li><li>Melee weapons stamina cost</li><li>Shrapnel spawning</li><li>Fire damage</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Spread:</strong> Spread refers to how much a projectile veers from the point you're aiming at when you fire. This rebalance primarily targets SMGs and sidearms, which previously had noticeably higher spread values. We've reviewed all primary, sidearm, and support weapons with the intent to significantly reduce spread overall, as it didn’t make much sense for these specific weapons to have such high inaccuracy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Drag:</strong> Drag determines how quickly a projectile loses speed over distance, affecting its damage. We've increased drag for pistol-caliber ammunition (used in SMGs and some sidearms) to better represent its shorter, wider projectile compared to rifle rounds. As a result, these weapons will be slightly less effective at longer ranges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sway:</strong> Sway refers to how much the weapon's aim shifts, influenced by factors like movement and stance. It represents the weapon's inertia and stability—so weapons with lower ergonomics will experience less sway, while those with higher ergonomics will have more. Sidearms will naturally have more sway than primaries due to the lack of support features like stocks. This balance patch specifically focuses on adjusting sway for primaries and sidearms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Stamina Cost:</strong> All melee weapons now consume less stamina when attacking, reducing the cost from 0.1 to 0.05. This change makes melee combat less punishing and allows for easier repositioning between strikes. The affected weapons include the CQC-30 Stun Baton, CQC-19 Stun Lance, CQC-5 Combat Hatchet, and the Entrenchment Tool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shrapnel spawning:</strong> With this update, shrapnel will now always spawn in a full 360-degree spread, regardless of where the explosion occurs. This means weapons like the R-36 Eruptor will now more reliably hit the intended target with their shrapnel. In addition, we’ve adjusted shrapnel performance against armor. Shrapnel now has reduced effectiveness at poor impact angles, to reflect its lack of design for armor penetration in such situations. These shrapnel balance changes will impact the following weapons:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>R-36 Eruptor</li><li>G-6 Frag Grenade</li><li>AC-8 Autocannon</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Balance Changes:</strong> Armor Penetration decreased on shrapnel projectiles from 3-3-3-0 to 3-3-2-0</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Each of these numbers represent an angle threshold, which means we’ve reduced the AP value of 3 to 2 in the last range where a shrapnel projectile would penetrate an enemy.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Frag Grenade</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Increased Shrapnel spawned from 30 to 35</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Autocannon Flak</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Increased Shrapnel spawned from 25 to 30</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fire and Flamethrowers:</strong> This update aims to better balance fire damage between direct hits (like those from flamethrowers) and burn effects over time, while also introducing scaling of fire damage depending on the size of the enemy. Previously, burn damage didn’t scale well against larger enemies, making putting them on fire feel less effective in those encounters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, the larger the enemy, the more damage they take while burning. However, bigger enemies will also be slightly more resistant to ignition. Additionally, direct fire damage now scales with enemy size—so large enemies like Chargers will still take roughly the same damage as before, while smaller enemies will take slightly less.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have also increased the magazine capacity of the FLAM-66 Torcher and the FLAM-40 Flamethrower because putting stuff on fire is fun!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Damage</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Burning damage now scales with enemy size and will do more damage over time to larger enemies</li><li>Fire direct damage also scales with enemy size. The base damage of direct fire hits has been lowered as compensation. This means that large enemies will take roughly the same amount of damage as before, while smaller enemies will take slightly less</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Time to ignite</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Larger enemies now take longer to ignite</li><li>Robotic enemies are harder to set on fire than organic ones</li><li>Incendiary Ammunition and Lasers are now less effective at igniting enemies, but once they do, the resulting burn damage is more impactful thanks to the new scaling system</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Helldiver</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Helldiver is now slightly more resistant to being set on fire</li><li>Burn damage taken by the Helldiver remains unchanged</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Primary weapons</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>AR-23 Liberator</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spread decreased from 4 to 2</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>AR-23P Liberator Penetrator</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Starting magazines increased from 5 to 6</li><li>Max spare magazines increased from 7 to 8</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>AR-23C Liberator Concussive</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spread decreased from 24 to 4</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>StA-52 Assault Rifle</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spread decreased from 4 to 2</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>AR-23A Liberator Carbine</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spread decreased from 4 to 3</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>AR-61 Tenderizer</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spread decreased from 4 to 1</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>SMG-37 Defender</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spread decreased from 20 to 5</li><li>Drag increased from 0.3 to 0.6</li><li>Sway increased from 1 to 1.2</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>SMG-72 Pummeler</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spread decreased from 20 to 5</li><li>Drag increased from 0.3 to 0.6</li><li>Sway increased from 1 to 1.2</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>MP-98 Knight</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spread decreased from 25 to 5</li><li>Drag increased from 0.3 to 0.6</li><li>Sway increased from 1 to 1.2</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>StA-11 SMG</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spread decreased from 25 to 5</li><li>Drag increased from 0.3 to 0.6</li><li>Sway increased from 1 to 1.2</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>SMG-32 Reprimand</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spread decreased from 40 to 5</li><li>Drag increased from 0.3 to 0.6</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JAR-5 Dominator</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Sway decreased from 1 to 0.8</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>R-63CS Diligence Counter Sniper</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Sway decreased from 1 to 0.8</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>FLAM-66 Torcher</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Magazine capacity increased by 25%</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>R-36 Eruptor</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spread decreased from 10 to 5</li><li>Ergonomics increased from -14 to 25</li><li>Sway decreased from 1 to 0.8</li><li>Fire rate increased from 25 to 32</li><li>Fixed a bug that allowed players to cancel the Eruptor's round cycling animation, effectively increasing its fire rate The intent with these changes:</li><li>The improvements made to the Eruptor are designed to compensate for the removal of the reload exploit, ensuring that its overall power remains steady or even improved</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>PLAS-39 Accelerator Rifle</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Drag decreased from 1.5 → 0.1</li><li>Is now categorized as an energy weapon in the loadout menu</li><li>The changes to drag means it wont lose speed and damage as it travels through the air and does the damage you would expect it to do</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Sidearm weapons</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>GP-31 Ultimatum</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Is now affected by the Hellpod Optimization Booster</li><li>Explosion damage increased from 1000 to 2000</li><li>Explosion inner radius decreased from 4 to 2 m</li><li>Projectile damage decreased from 3500 to 1000</li><li>Demolition strength decreased from 50 to 40</li><li>Sway increased from 1 to 1.3</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">**The intent with these changes: **</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>We want to maintain the Ultimatum's overall power level while rebalancing how that power is delivered—shifting more of the damage from the projectile itself to the explosion.

As you’d expect, the internet captured the trailer, which we expect will be released officially soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Complete Edition includes the base game and all the DLC released so far for both PS5 and PC. The news comes over a year after Stellar Blade’s successful April 2024 launch on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stellar Blade has all the features you’d expect on PC, including AI upscaling via Nvidia DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 3, an unlocked framerate, Japanese and Chinese voiceover, ultrawide display support, higher resolution environment textures, and DualSense support for haptic feedback and trigger effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, the trailer reveals a new boss battle vs Mann, Leader of the Sentinels, and 25 new costumes, which we presume will also be made available on PS5. Players have also noticed that, at the end of the trailer, Eve lets go of a memory stick — a sequence that isn't in the base game. Some are now speculating Stellar Blade is set for a new ending or maybe even DLC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/qua2wq8-1747125726116.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The trailer reveals the Stellar Blade Complete Edition, coming to PC and PS5.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Stellar Blade was a big hit for Korean developer Shift Up, bringing in $43 million in royalties in its last financial year. It expects the PC version to outsell the PS5 version, which sold more than 1 million copies in two months. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-shift-up-considering-a-sequel"><u>Shift Up has said it's considering making another game in the franchise</u></a>, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stellar Blade sees players take on the role of Eve as she battles against unknown invaders to reclaim Earth in fast paced action role-playing game combat. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-review"><u>It earned a 7/10 in IGN's review</u></a> and proved popular otherwise, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-exclusive-stellar-blade-sells-1-million-copies"><u>quickly selling a million copies</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Stellar Blade is great in all of the most important ways for an action game, but dull characters, a lackluster story, and several frustrating elements of its RPG mechanics prevent it from soaring along with the best of the genre," we said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
