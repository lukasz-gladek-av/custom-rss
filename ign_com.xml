The long-awaited movie reboot starring Peter Dinklage is finally hitting theaters in September, and the Toxic Crusaders beat-em-up game is slated for release in Q2 2025. Not to be outdone, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-toxic-avenger-ahoy-comics-crossover-jesus-christ">AHOY Comics is in the midst of "Toxic Mess Summer,"</a> as Toxie teams up with heroes from across the AHOY Universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN can exclusively reveal that AHOY will follow up Toxie Team-Up with a Toxic Crusaders series, one that, like the game, aims to capitalize on the nostalgia surrounding the classic animated series. Check out the Retroware game variant cover to Toxic Crusaders #1 below:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/28/toxiccrusaders-01-coverc-1748471368354.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Art by Xander Arnot.

(Image Credit: AHOY Comics)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Toxic Crusaders is a five-issue miniseries written by franchise veteran (and Pulitzer prize finalist) Matt Bors and illustrated by newcomer Tristan Wright. The series pairs Toxie with No-Zone, Junkyard, Major Disaster, and a brand-new character called Fungirl.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the aftermath of the chemical spill that created Toxie, other mutants arose — and they have united to wage war against an alien conspiracy,” said Bors in AHOY's press release. “We are taking everything from the original Toxic Crusaders cartoon —gross mutations, evil aliens, and over-the-top ecological action — to bring readers a must-read mutant monthly.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Everyone at AHOY Comics is delighted to publish a world-famous group of characters who are as well-meaning, violent, and frankly disgusting as we ourselves wish we could be,” said AHOY Comics Editor-in-Chief Tom Peyer. “We’re also delighted to debut the work of talented artist Tristan Wright. Matt found some of Tristan's work online and shared it with me — and we both thought, where has he been all our lives? It's solid, imaginative, amusing work, and we intend to extract as much as we can, like the cold-blooded capitalists we are."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Toxic Crusaders #1 will be released on September 10, 2025, just after The Toxic Avenger movie hits theaters.

Director Macon Blair and the rest of the creative team may have more money to play with than Michael Herz and Lloyd Kaufman’s 1984 original, but it struggles to deliver on the schlocky goodness of Troma’s stronger films. Still, what it lacks in so-bad-it’s-good silliness it makes up for with its heart and mostly practical slaughterfests. Kevin Bacon and Peter Dinklage having an absolute blast in their roles doesn’t hurt, either."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

When asked why there's no option for a pair of players to drop in together without a matchmade third player, Ishizaki said it was overlooked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that," said Ishizaki. "As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start," Ishizaki continued. "And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed. So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if you're playing with just your favorite duos partner, be ready to accept a random third into your lives.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-games-series-tier-list<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Which Nintendo franchise do you think is the greatest?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As I’m sure you’re aware, the Nintendo Switch 2 is upon us. So, with a brand new console on the horizon, what better time to look back at some of the legendary publisher’s greatest games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For decades, Nintendo has given us some of the most famous and best-selling game series ever made, but here, I’ve picked out 18 of the most well-known ones to sort through. Yes, this list could stretch into the 100s, but we don’t want to be here all day, do we? From Super Mario to Zelda, we all have our favourites, and some (sorry Kirby) that we’ve just never quite clicked with. I’ve had a go at ranking them via one of our IGN Tier Lists, purely taking into account <strong>my personal enjoyment</strong> of each series over the years. Take a look at my tier list here:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/29/screenshot-2025-05-29-at-13-38-28-1748522322130.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Simon Cardy's Nintendo Series Tier List</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m sure it’s no surprise to see both Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda in my S-tier category. Two of the most influential and, crucially, very fun video game series to ever do it, it’s a no-brainer really. On the other end of the scale… I’m sure a few eyebrows will be raised at my placing of Super Smash Bros. in the C tier. Please let me explain myself before battering me in the comments, please. Smash Bros. has just never been my thing, I’m afraid. Not only am I not a fighting game fan, but in a time when lots of people grew up playing it with friends, I was simply enjoying other multiplayer and party games, whether those be TimeSplitters, Guitar Hero, or Call of Duty. I just don’t have the connection to Smash Bros. that so many do, and for that, I can only ask for your complete forgiveness.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t agree with me? Think that Pikmin is better than Pokémon? Well, why not have a go at ranking some of Nintendo’s biggest series yourself in a tier list below, where you can compare your own S, A, B, C, and D tiers with the whole of the IGN community. </p><div id="nintendo-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Series Tier List</h3><h3>Nintendo Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s your favourite Nintendo series that hasn’t made it onto this list?
