            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Cut to the chase.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> has done about as well as its predecessor, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, in terms of U.S. sales, an analyst has revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has yet to announce a global sales figure for Ghost of Yotei, which launched exclusively on PlayStation 5 on October 2, 2025. So we’re left with regional data from sales analysts, who are unable to confirm hard sales figures but can compare launch performance in percentage difference terms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3wthi4twc2u" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Circana’s Mat Piscatella took to social media</a> to reveal the data underpinning the commercial performance of Sucker Punch’s sequel, calling its launch “perfectly fine... Not amazing, not bad.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s in comparison to Ghost of Tsushima, which was a breakout hit for Sony when it launched on PlayStation 4 amid lockdowns in July 2020.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Five years later, Ghost of Yotei has performed as well as Ghost of Tsushima in dollar terms. That is, in terms of the revenue it has generated, as opposed to unit sales. Ghost of Yotei launch week unit sales in the U.S. were down by a mid-single digit percent versus Ghost of Tsushima — so yes, it sold slightly less — but dollar sales were up by a similar mid-single digit percent, Piscatella confirmed. The average price per unit was about 12% higher for Ghost of Yotei than Ghost of Tsuhima’s launch week. “So... effectively flat,” Piscatella said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Piscatella pointed out, there is an important context we need to understand when making the comparison. “Everyone was home in July of 2020, and gaming saw a significant boom in player count and engagement,” he said. “At the time, the PS4's installed base was about 20% higher than the PS5's is today.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I look at it and say... it did somewhere between fine and great given all the factors at play,” Piscatella continued. “But it's early.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The true test now for Ghost of Yotei in terms of commercial performance will be in how well it holds in the coming weeks and months. And we of course do not know what Sony’s internal targets are for the title. It may be underperforming, doing fine, or overperforming versus Sony expectations. Ghost of Tsushima ended up a hugely successful release, with over 13 million sold as of September 2024, so Ghost of Yotei has plenty of work to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In any case, in the U.S. it was a perfectly fine launch,” Piscatella concluded. “Not amazing, not bad.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a similar situation in Europe, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sales-of-ps5-exclusive-ghost-of-yotei-in-line-with-ghost-of-tsushima-in-europe-new-data-reveals">where Ghost of Yotei sales are in-line with Ghost of Tsushima’s</a>. <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/ghost-of-yotei-delivers-strong-opening" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a> noted that Ghost of Yotei is the biggest first-party PlayStation launch since Spider-Man 2 in October 2023. That includes Arrowhead's record-breaking Helldivers 2, which had serious issues at launch but went on to sell an incredible 12 million copies in 12 weeks across PS5 and PC.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what’s next from developer Sucker Punch, in an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-will-remain-a-single-project-studio-after-ghost-of-yotei-boss-suggests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>, co-founder and studio head, Brian Fleming, said the studio will decide its next project once the multiplayer add-on Ghost of Yotei: Legends comes out in 2026.
