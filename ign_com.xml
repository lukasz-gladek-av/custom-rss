            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-cookbooks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Level up your cooking skills. </h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Video games and cooking go together more than you might think. Tons of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> and simulation games have some form of cooking mechanic or, at the very least, delicious-looking food. From the cozy familiarity of meals from Stardew Valley to fantastical feasts in The Witcher, I can personally say I've encountered tons of animated food I wish was real. Well, turns out it can be. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gaming cookbooks offer an opportunity to learn unique recipes while immersing yourself in the lore of a world you love. Getting the materials you need might not be as fun as in-game adventuring or farming, but the end result is more than worth it. Whether you're passionate about a specific game, are looking for gift ideas, or just love some themed recipes, here's our list of the best gaming cookbooks in 2025. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Our Favorite Gaming Cookbooks in 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of our top picks for gaming cookbooks is The Official Stardew Valley cookbook, which features 50 recipes written in the voice of various characters as well as some adorable art. The recipes are naturally based on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Cooking_Recipes">meals you can make in-game</a>, including Pink Cake, Strange Buns, and even a full Autumn's Bounty to help you power through the mines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A great gift to inspire young chefs (especially those who particularly enjoyed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-a-minecraft-movie">A Minecraft Movie</a>), the Minecraft cookbook includes 40+ recipes inspired by the game's various mobs and biomes. The same goes for The Pokémon Cookbook, which focuses more on cute snacks and quick meals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of crafting-based games, themed cookbooks are also a great way to immerse yourself in fantasy worlds. The official Witcher cookbook takes inspiration from the games as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-books-reading-order">The Witcher books</a>, with 80 recipes covering everything from a refreshing drink to an exquisite banquet. The Elder Scrolls cookbook hones in on the world of Skyrim (as opposed to the rest of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-games-in-order">Elder Scrolls games</a>) while the Fallout cookbook is great for anyone who's particularly curious about the taste of Nuka-Cola. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls: The Official Cookbook</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the tabletop side of gaming, the Heroes' Feast Dungeons &amp; Dragons cookbook is the crème de la crème for anyone trying to impress their party. Across the board, these cookbooks feature great recipes as well as interesting new bits of lore and art for dedicated fans. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Upcoming Video Game Cookbooks </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The trend of gaming cookbooks isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Some upcoming gaming cookbooks include one inspired by Pac-Man, which, to be completely honest, is a mystery to me, as well as Borderlands, presumably part of the promotions for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>. As someone who's long been curious about Sojiro's curry from Persona 5, I'm particularly excited about the cookbook inspired by the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">Persona games</a> coming out later this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Blythe (she/her) is an SEO Coordinator at IGN who spends way too much time in character customization screens and tracking down collectibles. </em></p></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 30, 2025 9:58 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
