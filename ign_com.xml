            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/people-are-streaming-assassins-creed-shadows-a-month-ahead-of-its-official-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> has leaked online, with people streaming the game a month before its official release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1iwk59a/assassins_creed_shadows_gameplay_leak/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamingLeaksandRumours subreddit</a>, now-removed social posts revealed images and gameplay from someone who claimed to have bought the game from an online marketplace. Assassin’s Creed Shadows also appeared in now-deleted listings on a U.S. auction site, with one user selling listing multiple copies of the game sold for $100 each, according to <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/assassins-creed-shadows-physical-copies-sold-early-leaks-gameplay-shared-online/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheGamer</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, multiple Twitch streams showing Assassin’s Creed Shadows have appeared, although they are being removed according to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-shadows-is-already-being-leaked-and-streamed-online-a-month-before-release/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a>. Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches officially on March 20, 2025. IGN has asked Ubisoft for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an unfortunate situation for Ubisoft, which has faced a series of difficulties with Assassin’s Creed Shadows since it was announced. Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-insists-assassins-creed-shadows-preorders-are-tracking-solidly-in-line-with-odyssey">Ubisoft insisted that Assassin's Creed Shadows had a strong number of preorders</a> despite its troubled development and promotional period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The struggling publisher said in its latest financial report that "preorders for the game are tracking solidly, in line with those of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, the second most successful entry of the franchise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot maintained this confidence. "Early previews have been positive, praising its narrative and immersive experience, with both characters playing critical roles in the game’s storyline, as well as the quality and complementarity of the gameplay provided by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-players-wont-be-missing-out-if-they-largely-ignore-one-protagonist"><u>the dual protagonist approach</u></a>,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I want to commend the incredible talent and dedication of the entire Assassin’s Creed’s team, who is working tirelessly to ensure that Shadows delivers on the promise of what is the franchise’s most ambitious entry yet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin's Creed Shadows was originally planned for November before Ubisoft bumped it back to February 14. Another delay saw it pushed again to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-this-time-by-another-month"><u>the current release date of March 20</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot rests on the shoulders of Assassin's Creed Shadows as not only the long-awaited Japan-set entry and the first full Assassin's Creed since 2020, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales"><u>a struggling Ubisoft needs it to perform well</u></a> following recent flops and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-investors-grill-ceo-cfo-on-potential-tencent-sale-delays-and-financial-woes"><u>investor frustration</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not enjoyed a particularly positive promotional period so far, however, with the development team having to apologize on separate occasions for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern"><u>inaccuracies in Assassin's Creed Shadows' depictions of Japan</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission"><u>using a historical recreation group's flag without permission</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another controversy came as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design"><u>collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</u></a> over its "insensitive" design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The ending is seen by some as a sort of retirement for Peter Parker, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yuri-lowenthal-on-marvels-spider-man-2-ending-i-dont-think-thats-the-last-were-gonna-see-peter">Lowenthal has repeatedly said Pete has more to offer</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There have been some comments recently that were picked up to infer that Peter’s out and Miles is in,” Lowenthal said in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/yuri-lowenthal-marvels-spider-man-2-ending-johnny-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-1235923489/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Variety</u></a> last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While I think that Peter would love to believe that he can just turn it off and not be Spider-Man anymore and live a completely normal life, I don’t think that’s what’s going to happen now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think 100% he trusts Miles,” Lowenthal continued. “Miles has really stepped up and he’s like, ‘Oh, maybe I can get a little break.’ And I did get a vacation to Symkaria during the Miles game. Not much of a vacation, but at least MJ got to learn to ride a motorcycle, which is awesome.” That motorcycle line is a nod to MJ’s newfound skill with a bike in Spider-Man 2 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/marvels-spider-man-2/Easter_Eggs"><u>and a cool Akira Easter egg</u></a>).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Spider-Man 2: All The Marvel Easter Eggs and References at Coney Island</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In October, Insomniac made the shock announcement that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-insomniacs-spider-man-2-confirmed-to-be-skipping-story-dlc-fans-are-waving-goodbye-and-wondering-whats-next"><u>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</u> wouldn’t get any additional story content</a>, putting to bed fan hopes for DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The announcement came in the same breath that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-pc-officially-announced-with-january-release-date"><u>Sony announced a PC version of Spider-Man 2</u></a>, which launched in January — one of the quickest turnarounds from single-player PS5 exclusive to PC from the company so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Spider-Man 2 came out in September 2023, Insomniac has released a number of updates for the game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-patch-1002000-adds-new-game-mission-replay-new-suits-and-more"><u>adding New Game+, mission replay, new suits, and more</u></a>. But fans had hoped that story DLC would give them more of a reason to return to Insomniac's wonderful recreation of New York than the addition of new features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But fans hadn’t just hoped for Spider-Man 2 story DLC, they had expected it after the game itself left a number of threads that Insomniac might have pulled on for additional content, including the introduction of Carnage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, though, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/insomniac-hackers-release-stolen-data-leak-wolverine-videos-future-projects-and-more"><u>the devastating Insomniac data breach of December 2023</u></a>, which revealed the studio’s upcoming slate of releases, and the accidental release of Spider-Man 2’s development game menu last year, all pointed to planned DLC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/first-mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-gameplay-looks-straight-out-of-terminator-2-and-theres-a-surprise-kameo-dlc-character-coming-too<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> developer NetherRealm has released the first gameplay for DLC guest character the T-1000 and confirmed Madam Bo as a DLC Kameo fighter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The T-1000 gameplay shows off a number of attacks that rekindle memories of Terminator 2, including the T-1000’s blade and hook arms. The character's attacks look a bit like those belonging to Baraka and Kabal. At one point we see the T-1000 turn into a liquid metal blob before rising from the ground in an uppercut reminiscent of attacks by Killer Instinct’s Glacius.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat 1's T-1000 features the voice and likeness of actor Robert Patrick, who famously played the character in the 1991 film. This teaser reveals Patrick’s voice work for the first time in a clash with Johnny Cage. It ends with a longer look at one of the T-1000’s Fatalities, which recreates the iconic chase scene in Terminator 2 where the T-1000 drives a truck in pursuit of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Terminator and Edward Furlong’s John Connor. In the Fatality, the T-1000 blobs out of the driver’s seat to pump the hapless Cage full of lead.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, NetherRealm made the surprise announcement that Madam Bo is set to hit Mortal Kombat 1 as a DLC Kameo fighter at the same time as the T-1000. Madam Bo is a fan-favorite character from the base Mortal Kombat 1 story, an elderly restaurant owner who fends off Smoke and his goons before Raiden and Kung Lao get stuck in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We see Madam Bo gameplay briefly in the teaser, first in a glimpse and you'll miss it frame as the T-1000 and Johnny Clash pre-game, then when the T-1000 calls in Madam Bo for an assist.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The T-1000 is available in Mortal Kombat 1 starting March 18 as part of the early access period for Khaos Reigns<em><strong> </strong></em>owners, followed by wide availability for purchase on March 25. Madam Bo is available on March 18 as a free content update for Khaos Reigns<em><strong> </strong></em>owners or as a standalone purchase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">T-1000 is the final DLC character set to be added to the gory fighting game as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian. Fans have wondered for some time now whether developer NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters, or a Kombat Pack 3, amid questions about Mortal Kombat 1’s sales success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated, however, that it still believes in the Mortal Kombat franchise. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady"><u>the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which is Mortal Kombat</u></a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/23/screenshot-2025-02-23-222435-1740349491604.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Madam Bo is coming to Mortal Kombat 1 as a Kameo fighter.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Mortal Kombat development chief Ed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago"><u>Boon said NetherRealm had decided on its next game three years prior, but promised to support Mortal Kombat 1 “for a long time to come.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans of the studio’s work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, Injustice, although neither NetherRealm nor Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that. The first game in the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-gods-among-us"><u>Injustice: Gods Among Us</u></a>, launched in 2013, with its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-2"><u>Injustice 2</u></a>, coming out in 2017. NetherRealm released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-11"><u>Mortal Kombat 11</u></a> in 2019 and for a time it seemed like the studio would alternate between Mortal Kombat and Injustice games, but it went on to release another Mortal Kombat, the soft reboot that is Mortal Kombat 1, in 2023 instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-ed-boon-says-door-not-closed-on-injustice-3"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> in June 2023, Boon spoke in vague terms about this decision. "There were a number of factors, some of which I can talk about, some of which I probably shouldn't," Boon said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two reasons Boon was willing to discuss were the unfortunate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the team's choice to switch to a newer version of the Unreal game engine (Mortal Kombat 11 runs on Unreal Engine 3, whereas Mortal Kombat 1 runs on Unreal Engine 4).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But we did go to a new graphics engine, Unreal," Boon said. "We really wanted to be careful with COVID and all that stuff and everybody staying safe. So there were a bunch of variables involved that eventually we realized, 'Okay, let's do another Mortal Kombat game and hopefully we'll get back to the Injustice games.' "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to be sure, we wanted to confirm with him directly that the door was not closed on the Injustice franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not at all," Boon answered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
