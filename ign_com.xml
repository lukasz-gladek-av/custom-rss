While it’s easy to focus on the new bestiaries, rods, fish, and mutations added to the overall experience, fans should note that the update comes bundled in with the gargantuan Megalodon Hunt. It’s an event that adds giant prehistoric creatures to fish for, making this an especially enticing addition to one of Roblox’s most popular games.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/30/fisch-ancient-isles-the-megalodon-hunt-1732988478803.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fisch The Ancient Isles update gives Roblox fishing game its biggest content drop yet.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Ancient Isles have just been discovered—lush jungles, glowing ruins, mystery filled caves, and ancient fish whisper of secrets long forgotten,” a description from Fisching says. “What mysteries could these legendary lands unveil? Treasure, danger, and prehistoric wonders await those daring enough to explore!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fisch players can look forward to two Bestiaries – the Ancient Isles and Ancient Archives – as well as a whopping 12 new rods and 39 new fish. Today's update also comes with Rod Crafting and eight new mutations. There’s a lot to explore in the Ancient Isles, and thanks to an increased level cap of 750, you don’t have to worry about maxing out your level too early.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to what Fisching calls “a ton” of quality-of-life and bug fixes, Fisch fans can now find a rotating fan art board in Moosewood that will feature more player creations as future updates roll out. There are also a few new titles, new ziplines to use around the map, and optimization settings to take advantage of.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fisch has lured in thousands of Roblox fans since it released earlier this year, but today’s update has helped it reach new heights. The Ancient Isles and Megalodon Hunt event have both propelled the fishing experience into the public eye more than ever before, as players will now find it placed firmly <a href="https://www.roblox.com/charts#/?device=all&amp;country=all" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">atop the Roblox top trending charts</a>. The team published a statement on its successful launch in a message on <a href="https://discord.gg/fisch" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>its official Discord</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You, the players, broke a multiple year tradition that consisted of two games regularly passing on the crown,” the statement says. “A lot of the developers are getting emotional seeing this - myself and the CEO of Do Big Studios are also sharing the feeling mutually. This is something I've never expected. In a million years.

Roblox gift cards can be converted into the Robux needed to make those purchases, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-black-friday-2024-deals">Cyber Monday</a> is one of the best times to find those gift cards on sale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are slight discounts on digital gift cards, the best savings you can possibly get is by going physical: Right now, you can get <a href="https://zdcs.link/92bnVY?object_uuid=39532ff3-ef49-4e73-ba5e-8b9fe2472693&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a full $20 off $100 Roblox gift cards</a>.

Though, I have to admit, getting $100 worth of Robux at a $20 discount is something you could even gift to yourself. A $100 gift card is equivalent to about 10,000 Robux. By saving $20, you're basically getting a whopping 2,000 Robux for free. Act fast, however, because I'm sure this Lightning Deal will sell out quick. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on what month you redeem your Roblox gift card, you’ll also get a different free virtual item. In November, that gift is the Midnight Crimson Sombrero, but if you wait until December (heads up: That's tomorrow), you’ll get the Festive Deadpan Alpaca Head.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Does Roblox Have Its Own Cyber Monday Sale? </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox as a platform doesn’t have an "official" Cyber Monday sale, but you might find deals, discounts, and special events within specific experiences.
