As one of several Black Friday <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-video-games-black-friday-deals">video game deals</a> going on right now, the Silent Hill 2 remake was one highly requested by fans, and it did not disappoint. The game makes you uncomfortable but in an effective and thrilling way. In true horror fashion, there's blackout darkness, suffocating fog, unknown noises, grotesque enemies, and isolation. From our review, Matt Purslow states "The remake is a modern reminder not just of an era where Konami was a master of survival horror, but also the significant power of Silent Hill 2’s unrelenting misery."
