"As massive fans, we're beyond grateful for the generous gift of Oblivion Remastered game keys for our entire modding team! This means so much to us. Thank you for everything, Bethesda!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://skyblivion.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skyblivion</a> is an upcoming fan remake of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion made by the TESRenewal volunteer modding group. It uses Bethesda's Creation Engine to recreate Oblivion in the game's sequel, Skyrim. The project has technically been in the works for over a decade, beginning as a simple direct port and later expanding to a full remake with a number of improved features and even new content. We interviewed one of the developers behind it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skyblivion-oblivion-skyrim-mod-elder-scrolls">way back in 2021</a>. Skyblivion is expected to release this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Historically, Bethesda and the Skyblivion team have reportedly been on "<a href="https://www.vg247.com/skyblivion-skyrim-oblivion-remake-mod-lead-interview-c3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very good terms</a>," but as rumors of an official Oblivion remaster grew, some fans questioned if Bethesda wasn't trying to head off Skyblivion with its own version due to the suspiciously close release timing. A few days ago, anticipating today's showcase, the Skyblivion team <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k285wg/official_statement_from_the_skyblivion_team/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a statement</a> addressing these concerns. In it, the team said that Bethesda has "always been supportive of community projects like ours" and that "there is no need for comparisons or a sense of competition" between the two games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, Oblivision Remastered <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/69672" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">does not have official mod support</a>, though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-mods-have-already-been-published-online">fans have already been cooking up an array of unofficial mods for the game within hours of its release</a>. Additionally, both versions of Oblivion have unique aspects: Skyblivion, for instance, isn't available on console at all. Oblivision Remastered, on the other hand, does not include the new and refurbished content that Skyblivion has promised, but does have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-is-once-again-offering-paid-horse-armor-dlc">horse armor DLC</a> at launch for Deluxe Edition buyers. Both versions have different looks and feels, with different interpretations on how much Skyrim-ness should be incorporated into a retread of Oblivion.

It’s a lengthy explanation for what Bethesda itself defines as a remaster and why it chose to take the path that it has. As the developer thanked those who are playing Oblivion for the first time or revisiting it, it outright said it “never wanted to remake it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We never wanted to remake it – but remaster it – where the original game was there as you remember playing it, but seen through today’s technology,” Bethesda explained.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio’s clarification arrives as fans not only (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-images-leak-from-developer-website">officially</a>) see Oblivion Remastered for the first time but also go hands-on, too. It’s out now, bringing visual changes across the board alongside a few fundamental gameplay tweaks. Highlights include the ability to sprint as well as a new level-up system that is being described as a cross between what was found in the original Oblivion and the process players saw in The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it’s a new design for a sewer grate or a game-changing addition, the insurmountable number of tweaks has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake">many players feeling like Oblivion Remastered is more of a remake</a> than a simple fresh coat of paint. The last decade has indeed been polluted by video game remasters that mostly focus on minor visual improvements, but Bethesda is still hesitant to call its Oblivion re-release, which it started working on in 2021, a full-on remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We looked at every part and carefully upgraded it,” Bethesda continued. “But most of all, we never wanted to change the core. It’s still a game from a previous era and should feel like one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know many of our longtime fans will be thrilled to revisit Oblivion and the land of Cyrodiil. But there are also so many who have never played it. We can’t thank you enough for all the support you have given us and our games over the years. Our hope with this remaster is, that no matter who you are, when you step out of the Imperial sewer – you feel like you’re experiencing it for the first time.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">From all of us at Bethesda Game Studios... <a href="https://t.co/AKlUXrmYW5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/AKlUXrmYW5</a></p>— Bethesda Game Studios (@BethesdaStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1914718584414089525?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-finally-revealed-in-first-look-gameplay-and-its-out-today">out now</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S and is also available to play through Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/opinion-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-hit-harder-than-skyrim-and-still-does<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ask most gamers who were around for the Xbox 360 and, Red Ring of Death aside, odds are most of them will share a lot of fond memories with you. And The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion generated plenty of those memories for a lot of Xbox 360 owners. I’m one of them. I worked at Official Xbox Magazine at the time, and for whatever reason, the hugely successful port of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind to Xbox never quite hooked me. But right from the jump, Oblivion – which was initially planned to be a day-one launch title for the second Xbox – did. We did multiple cover stories on Oblivion leading up to launch – the screenshots alone blew everyone away – and I eagerly volunteered for each trip out to Bethesda in sleepy Rockville, Maryland. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, when it finally came time to review Oblivion – and this is back in the days when exclusive reviews were a common, accepted thing – I again eagerly jumped at the chance. I returned to Rockville one more time and holed up in a conference room in Bethesda’s basement for four days. I spent four consecutive – and glorious – 11-hour days almost literally living in Cyrodiil, spending almost every waking moment inside this stunning, wide-open, next-gen medieval fantasy world. Before I boarded my return flight home, I’d clocked 44 hours prior to penning OXM’s 9.5 out of 10 review of Oblivion, which I wholeheartedly stand by to this day. It was an incredible game, filled with gripping quests (Dark Brotherhood, anyone?), off-the-beaten-path surprises (if you know about the unicorn, you know), and so much more. Because I was playing a submission build at Bethesda – meaning, a mostly finished version of the game on an Xbox 360 debug kit rather than a regular retail console – I had to start over when I got my final boxed disc copy of the game I’d already put about two full real-life days into.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I dropped another 130 hours or so into The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion without hesitation,so it’s probably no surprise to hear that I’m absolutely thrilled it’s been remastered and re-released on modern platforms. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>For the younger generation of gamers who grew up on Skyrim, the just-released The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered will be their first “new” mainline Elder Scrolls game since Skyrim first released.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, I’m envious of the whole generation of younger gamers who grew up with Skyrim and thus, that is The Elder Scrolls for them. Because for them, the just-released The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered will be their first “new” mainline Elder Scrolls game since Skyrim released (for the first of many, many times) over 13 years ago – while franchise fans of all ages continue to wait for The Elder Scrolls VI, which is likely another 4-5 years away.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although if I’m being honest, I doubt Oblivion will hit the same way for them as it did for me in March of 2006, because, for starters, it’s a two-decade-old game (side note: shout-out to Bethesda for delivering this week instead of waiting an extra year when Oblivion will hit its far-more-elegant-sounding 20th anniversary instead of just having passed its 19th). Other games have built upon what Oblivion did, including several by Bethesda itself: Fallout 3, Skyrim, Fallout 4, and Starfield. And second, it just doesn’t pack the same visual punch that it did in 2006, when I’d argue it was the first true <em>next-gen </em>game of the HD Era ushered in by the Xbox 360. Obviously the remaster looks better than the original release – that’s the point, of course – but it doesn’t stand head and shoulders above nearly every other game as something that you’ve never seen before. By definition – or at least in practice – remasters aim to make an older game look modern on current platforms. It’s a sharp contrast to a proper remake a la Resident Evil, which carries the expectation of starting from scratch and, in turn, looking as good or better than anything else on the market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was the right game at the right time. By taking full advantage of HD televisions and expanding the scope and scale of what gamers could expect from an open-world game, it was a punch in the face to console gamers who, up to that point, had spent their entire gaming lives seeing their interactive worlds through an interlaced 640x480 television. (Although speaking of punches in the face, prior to Oblivion’s March release, in February 2006, EA released Fight Night Round 3, which was jaw-droppingly gorgeous itself.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My memories of Oblivion are plenty, as it was a world with so much to discover and so much to do. For first-time Oblivion players, let me give you a recommendation: either blast through the main quest as quickly as possible, or save it until you’ve exhausted every last sidequest or open-world activity. Why? Well, the Oblivion gates will start randomly spawning and pestering you once you start down that main questline’s path, so for my money it’s best to seal them off straight away. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, the technological leap made from Morrowind to Oblivion might not ever happen again – though I suppose if we wait long enough for The Elder Scrolls 6, maybe it will. But at the very least, playing Oblivion Remastered won’t present such a staunch difference from any release of Skyrim, and for that I suppose those same younger gamers who grew up with Skyrim won’t get what I had. But no matter if you’re playing Oblivion for the first time or you’ve clocked hundreds of hours with it, its fully realized medieval fantasy world and the surprises and adventures contained within it have always made it my favorite Elder Scrolls game. And I’m thrilled it’s back, even if its surprise release was spoiled many times over before it finally showed up again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.
