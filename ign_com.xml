            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against Pocketpair’s Palworld has stirred up much debate among game developers and players alike. However, former Capcom game developer Yoshiki Okamoto’s recent YouTube video, in which he made comments seemingly against Pocketpair and Palworld, has sparked a strong backlash from viewers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Current chairman of the Japan Game Culture Foundation, Yoshiki Okamoto has worked in the game industry for over 40 years, with a varied resume which includes Street Fighter 2, the first Resident Evil, and hit mobile game Monster Strike. He also created the original concept for what would become Rockstar’s Red Dead Revolver.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://youtu.be/ZIhdKKNRnI0?si=rTqnRy6Ngo_oolxe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube video</a> posted on his channel on September 27, Okamoto gave his opinions on the ongoing Nintendo vs. Pocketpair lawsuit, saying that Palworld had "crossed a line that should not be crossed, and I don't want the world to become a place where this kind of thing is acceptable."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the video, Okamoto said that “if a settlement is reached with Nintendo, then I think it (Palworld) will become a game that is officially fine to play. However, it is currently a game that’s being sued so it’s unacceptable. By playing the game you are supporting it, so please don’t buy it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comment and his labelling of Pocketpair as an “anti-xxxx” (Okamoto bleeped out and distorted the last kanji character of the word in both the audio and subtitle in the video) prompted a flood of criticism in the comments — and many did not hold back. The majority of commenters interpreted Okamoto’s half-obscured term as “hansha” or “anti-social force” (an abbreviated term often used to describe criminal organizations like the yakuza, and groups that operate in ways that go against the proper and/or legal way of doing things). One commenter pointed out that calling Pocketpair an “anti-social force” could be considered defamation. They then added, “On the other hand, your argument that ‘people should stop playing games with questionable content because this equates to supporting them’ is convincing,” before announcing that these words made them decide to quit playing Okamoto’s Monster Strike after nearly 20 years. Other user reactions included, “I think assuming something is bad just because it has been sued is wrong,” and, “No matter how much you dislike (Pocketpair and Palworld), calling them anti-social is crossing a line.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/01/screenshot-2025-10-01-135403-1759323276728.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yoshiki Okamoto issued controversial comments on Palworld. Image credit: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZIhdKKNRnI0?si=23R4LY-SlCDpqTaa">Yoshiki Okamoto YouTube channel.</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Okamoto openly acknowledges that even though people have recommended it to him, he has never actually played Palworld, insisting: “I have no intention of playing the game or spending money on it.” He pointed out that Palworld had become a divisive topic, with people split into fan and hater camps, and confirmed that he is anti-Palworld. “But at the same time, I understand that there are fans out there,” he added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the video, Okamoto also expressed concern that if Pocketpair wins the lawsuit and is able to release the full version of the game, then copyright infringement may be seen as more acceptable if a game is perceived as interesting and gets good reviews. He also worried that this could potentially open the floodgates to the hard work of creators on other Nintendo series (like Mario, Zelda etc.) being more freely and overtly copied, especially with the use of generative AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, commenters also pointed out that many games have used elements of previous titles made by other companies, noting that this includes games Okamoto worked on. People mentioned how Street Fighter 2 used similar elements to previous fighting games like Yie Ar Kung Fu, and how Monster Strike’s UI is similar to Puzzle &amp; Dragons. “How can someone who has done things like that speak out against Palworld?” sad one commented. Others pointed out that Okamoto’s mention of generative AI risks feeding the false rumor (since debunked by Pocketpair) that developer used gen AI in the creation of Palworld.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld: Palfarm First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Referencing the changes made to Palworld mechanics under dispute in the lawsuit, Okamoto predicted that Pocketpair have worked out some way to settle the matter with Nintendo, which is why it has announced a full, official release of the game. However, he noted that there is “no information” to properly confirm this at this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo-Palworld lawsuit, which has been ongoing in Japan since its announcement in September 2024, involves three patents, two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters.
