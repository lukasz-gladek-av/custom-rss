Image credit: Focus Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Techmarine is set to hit Saber Interactive’s explosive third-person action game as part of Patch 12 early next year. Its Omnissian Axe is a new melee weapon — a halberd-style weapon that comes with its own set of unique animations, finishers and progression, Focus confirmed in a <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/308-november-community-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the Techmarine has a Servo-Gun ability. Activating it will enable the gun to automatically engage enemies. The new class also has a passive ability to restore Tarantula Sentry Guns that can spawn on existing PvE levels. It all sounds pretty powerful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As has become Space Marine 2 tradition, Focus popped fun little Easter eggs in the PNG file names for the Techmarine and its Omnissian Axe. The Omnissian Axe PNG is called ‘toothpick,’ and, brilliantly, the Techmarine PNG is called ‘01100110_01101001_01101110_01100101_00100000_01110011_01101000_01111001_01110100.’</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Blood Angels Champion Pack Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1p8vsk0/comment/nr802s8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans were quick to work out</a> that this binary sequence actually translates to a phrase: "fine shyt."</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>01100110 = f</li><li>01101001 = i</li><li>01101110 = n</li><li>01100101 = e</li><li>00100000 = (space)</li><li>01110011 = s</li><li>01101000 = h</li><li>01111001 = y</li><li>01110100 = t</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not into Warhammer 40,000, that might be a tad confusing, but it will make most fans of the grimdark setting smirk. For the uninitiated, a Techmarine is a Space Marine engineer-type class who's a big fan of the Cult Mechanicus as well as their Chapter. They’re big on technology and specialize in soothing the machine spirits of wounded war engines, such as tanks and Dreadnoughts. All those bits and bobs coming out the Techmarine’s back are its servo-arm, mechadendrite, and a shoulder-mounted forge bolter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Focus wouldn’t say which Traitor Legion the Chaos Techmarine will be associated with in PvP. Expect more on that soon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In August, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-year-2-roadmap-reveals-content-plan-for-patch-10-right-up-to-2026s-patch-15-including-new-weapons-a-new-class-and-much-more">Focus revealed plans for Space Marine 2 patches all the way up to 15</a>, taking fans to the end of the second quarter of next year (June 2026). The Techmarine is set for release during the first quarter of 2026, a new Battle Barge expansion is due during the same period, and a new Siege map is planned for Q2 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Saber Interactive is also working on Space Marine 3, although it’s insisted <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-and-space-marine-3-are-definitely-not-competing-for-resources-dev-insists-while-remaining-coy-about-necrons-in-the-sequel">ongoing Space Marine 2 support and the sequel are "definitely not competing for resources."</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.

Looking for a new deck to try, or your first taste of the Commander format? This could be ideal for you.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">This Commander Deck Is Under $45 For Black Friday</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are five Tarkir Dragonstorm Commander Decks, with each representing a three-color combination of the Magic color pie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sultai is black, green, and blue, meaning you get some graveyard recursion, some big creatures, and slick control opportunities all in one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its two Commander options are Teval, the Balanced Scale, a 4/4 with flying that helps you build your lands from the graveyard and create Zombie Druids, and Kotis, Sibsig Champion, which also brings cards from the graveyard to power himself up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Teval is worth around $12 on its own, while other cards of value include the $7 Dauthi voidwalker and $6 Colossal Grave-Reaver. Add to that Life from the Loam ($6) and Teval’s Judgment ($10) and that’s a decent package in terms of value as well as gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for more Commander Decks from the Tarkir set?

It's single Energy cost without having to recycle Runes is an extremely valuable rate both on turn one and in the late game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's going for around $5-$6, so as an uncommon it's a bit pricey. </p></div><p id="tasty-faefolk"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tasty Faefolk">Tasty Faefolk</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230460"><div id="230460" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tasty Faefolk</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Tasty Faefolk sees play in most Calm (green) decks. It's a great late-game finisher on a budget, currently sitting at around $7. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I might not play three of these due to its high cost, but it depends on the deck it's slotted in. </p></div><p id="darius-trifarian"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Darius Trifarian">Darius Trifarian</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230461"><div id="230461" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Darius Trifarian</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Darius is a considerably good mid-game drop in Fury (red) decks. Midrange strategies like Sett the Boss will often play a copy or two, and you'll likely see him taking up space in the top-tier <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmOgRq?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kai'sa, Daughter of the Void</a> decks as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At $10, it's reasonably priced for a powerful effect. </p></div><p id="falling-star"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Falling Star">Falling Star</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230462"><div id="230462" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Falling Star</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Kai'sa, Falling Star is another card this deck typically considers including three copies of. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two Power, two Energy cost disrupts your tempo a bit, but it can be an extremely efficient boardwipe in a pinch. I'd also consider playing this in any other red deck like <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8Ard?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jinx, Loose Cannon</a>, especially at the reasonably-priced $13. </p></div><p id="baited-hook"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Baited Hook">Baited Hook</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230463"><div id="230463" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Baited Hook</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Veteran Magic: The Gathering players will recognize this as Riftbound's answer to <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDrx2X?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Birthing Pod</a>. It's a great combo card that pairs nicely with cards like <a href="https://zdcs.link/9215M1?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Machine Evangel</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In go-wide strategies like <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBD37v?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Viktor, Herald of the Arcane</a>, Baited Hook can be a great finisher if you're able to stomach the $37 price tag. </p></div><p id="master-yi"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Master Yi">Master Yi</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230464"><div id="230464" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Master Yi</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the strongest Legends in the game so far, Master Yi, Wuju Bladesman's $38 cost is due to both his popularity and scarcity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can only get him in the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjgwy?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Proving Grounds</a> box (as well as three other exclusive Legends), and getting your hands on that is currently a bit of a chore. But if you're looking to quickly build the second-best meta deck, singles are readily available. </p></div><p id="thousand-tailed-watcher"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Thousand-Tailed Watcher">Thousand-Tailed Watcher</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230465"><div id="230465" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Thousand-Tailed Watcher</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best cards in the game as a whole, every Mind (blue) deck will consider auto-including three of these, even with its high cost. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thousand-Tailed Watcher is incredible late game finisher to score your last points, and strategizing your Battlefields and units in conjunction with it will mean the difference between victory and defeat. Because of this, it's currently sitting at around $40. </p></div><p id="dazzling-aurora"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dazzling Aurora">Dazzling Aurora</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230466"><div id="230466" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dazzling Aurora</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the only cards in Riftbound Origins I would consider borderline unfair and actually broken, Dazzling Gleam is an incredibly powerful finisher in decks like Master Yi ramp. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its nine Energy cost is worth considering, but spitting out massive Units like <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWEDgn?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deadbloom Predator</a> for free will quickly win the game, especially since not many decks run much Gear removal. </p></div><p id="kaisa-survivor"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Kai'sa Survivor">Kai'sa Survivor</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230467"><div id="230467" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kai'sa Survivor</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The end-all, tier-1 meta deck in Riftbound Origins. Her aggressive cost mixed with her extremely powerful effect ensures she sees play in most red decks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're running Kai'Sa, Daughter of the Void as your Legend, playing three Kai'Sa Survivor is a no-brainer. That is, of course, if you're able to get your hands on three copies. She's currently sitting around $73, so I wouldn't blame you if you found some budget replacements. </p></div><p id="time-warp"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Time Warp">Time Warp</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230468"><div id="230468" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Time Warp</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, I'm not the biggest fan of extra turn effects in TCG's, since they often give an unfair edge when used. Regardless, Riftbound's Time Warp is an extremely powerful, high-cost effect that is the metagame's current most expensive staple, sitting at around $86-$90. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most blue decks run at least one of these, so it may be worth it to pick up a single copy to build up store credit. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Riftbound Cards to Keep an Eye On</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, these aren't the only format staples or expensive cards Riftbound has to offer in its over 300-card Origins set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are dozens of much more expensive alternate versions of many Legends and Champions, and more metagame staples that will break the bank a bit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if you're more interested in the collector value of these cards over their competitive use, we have a list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-origins-most-expensive-cards">15 most expensive Riftbound cards</a> you can buy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also have a handy <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riftbound-league-of-legends-where-to-buy">buying guide</a> if you're new to Riftbound. While sealed product can be hard to find right now and price hikes are rampant, but knowing what's available is always a good move when a new TCG launches. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">TCGplayer Subscription</h2></div><div catalogid="0cc34152-a4aa-4aaf-8c84-5d8a17b23349" id="231794"><div id="231794" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>(Up to 15% Cashback for Cyber Weekend) Free Shipping and up to 3% Cashback on orders over $35</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>TCGPlayer Subscription</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Free Shipping and up to 3% Cashback on orders over $35</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're planning on snapping up quite a few Pokémon cards in the sale, this is a great time to become a <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2Emr?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGplayer subscriber</a>.

Is there a cadence you have in mind?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gibson:</strong> In simple terms yes, we’d be thinking about different things arriving at different scales. That might mean larger things like Godmaster. Certainly, we’ve noticed that people would like an expansion in that way, being able to enter pantheon spaces and refight bosses. And there is already a huge number of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pellen:</strong> We were talking about the next project in general. We’re not thinking about the size. We just started making new stuff and working on bits and pieces. We’re still in this world, thinking about stuff to present to people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gibson:</strong> It is interesting working out how you expand an already huge game, to make sure you don’t completely overwhelm new players, because obviously new players will be experiencing the new stuff, very naturally integrated. It’ll just seem like the base experience. Some of that might mean finding ways to hide away the access, because otherwise potentially by the end of the our expansions and developments it would just be gargantuan.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong Release Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Silksong remains one of the most-played games on Steam following its huge September 4 release.

AliExpress is offering a <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8Wxd?object_uuid=18c5aacb-d0aa-4047-ae4a-af82f50c6187&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World console bundle</a> for just $435.87 (normally $500) after you apply a $100 off coupon code "<strong>AEUS100</strong>" during checkout.
