            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection’s release date is right around the corner, and IGN had the chance to speak to the developers in depth about a brand new locales trailer released at IGN Fan Fest. We’ve got never-before-seen concept art of the three main bases in the game – Azuria Castle, Shepharden, and Galyad – and insightful commentary from director Kenji Oguro, art director Takahiro Kawano, and lead game designer Daisuke Wakahara. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> is shaping up to be a beautiful game, which is wholly supported by the diverse scenery you’ll encounter on your journey as an environmentalist Ranger. The Monster Hunter Stories 3 team allocated a lot of time and research into making the locations enjoyable for players, and their attention to detail shows. You can watch the new locales video with commentary direct from the developers above, or, if you’d like to immerse yourself in the scenery with no commentary and a few bonus scenes, check out the trailer below. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Azuria </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played the free demo version of Monster Hunter Stories 3, you’ve seen Azuria. This land features fields, forests, and picturesque mountains on the horizon with a castle town on a lake, lending a classic storybook backdrop. 
</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Azuria Concept Art - Monster Hunter Stories 3</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the design process, we wanted to make the stereotypical fantasy castle type of design to depict how peaceful Azuria is, and to depict the beautiful nature of the world of Azuria and the castle itself,” Kawano said. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team had some real-world inspiration that made its way into the concept art for the surrounding area of Azuria and its castle, specifically, a Spanish castle called Alcazar de Segovia. This wouldn’t be the first time the castle has inspired a creator – as part of its 100th anniversary, The Walt Disney Company revealed in 2023 that it was the inspiration for Snow White’s castle. A magical locale, indeed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kawano also described how the wing-like flags represent the wings of Rathalos to signify the special bond Azuria has with the endangered species. The town even has a runway of sorts for monsters to take flight, something uniquely logical for the Stories series, where Riders form bonds with monsters called Monsties and, as the name suggests, ride them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The attention to detail in the scenery carries into the connection of Twisted Reflection's story as well. The main catalyst of the plot in Stories 3 is the “Crystal Encroachment,” a phenomenon with unknown origins affecting both the environment and monsters, but the Egg Quartz it leaves behind is used by the residents of Azuria and elsewhere as a source of light. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Shepharden</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shepharden Concept Art - Monster Hunter Stories 3</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Shepharden is the second locale the protagonist and the rangers will visit, and if you’ve played a certain entry in the regular Monster Hunter lineup, you may recognize the lush environment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One key feature of [Shepharden] is that monsters from Monster Hunter Rise inhabit the area around it,” revealed Kawano. “So based on Monster Hunter Rise, as you may have known, it has a very Eastern, Asia-like taste. So Shepharden and the surrounding area is also designed after that art style.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might also notice a structure at the base of the stairs to the village elder’s place inspired by Japanese torii gates, clearly recognizable as orange, angular arches. Right beneath that torii gate are masks stuck into the ground, which represent the graves of the former elders of the village, explained Kawano. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Shepharden detail the team had to consider is that this village is not built for Riders the way Azuria is. As such, there aren’t stables – so Ratha, the protagonists’ Rathalos, is stuck into a very small space that’s part of an unused residence. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Galyad</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Galyad Concept Art - Monster Hunter Stories 3</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Galyad is a bustling, prosperous town surrounded by desert and relatively desolate lands compared to Azuria and Shepharden. It’s covered in decoration, stones, and jewelry, somewhat fueled by the residents’ successful trade of Egg Quartz. Kawano described that as you get deeper into the city of Galyad, you might discover a boundary between the prosperous residents and the not-so-fortunate residents, and find slum-like areas. 
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The city’s architecture and design is actually inspired by Mediterranean regions and even has a Lagiacrus fountain in the city center. It's especially interesting given the desert environment – Lagiacrus is, after all, a Leviathan monster known to inhabit the water. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Galyad used to be an ocean port city that was floating on top of the ocean,” Kawano explained. “So all the jewelry and the decorations were based off of the Mediterranean sea theme, but desertification has caused the city to lose all the water and it is currently barren, sandy. So that is the reason why there's a difference between the decorations and the actual cityscape itself.” 
</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Monster Hunter 3: Twisted Reflection Q&amp;A </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, I had to take advantage of the time I had speaking with the Monster Hunter 3: Twisted Reflection developers, so I asked a few questions unrelated to the new trailer I thought might be interesting. We got into the game's more mature protagonist, the weapon availability, the habitat restoration mechanic, and dual-element monsters. 
</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The interview below has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I'd say habitat restoration is one of the biggest new gameplay mechanics in Monster Hunter Stories 3. Can you describe the inspiration behind building the system and why you included it?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kenji Oguro: </strong>The first reason we wanted to implement this feature into Stories 3 is because of the protagonist. He or she is the captain of the Ranger Corps and their objective is to protect and preserve the environment. So we wanted to express the preservation of the environment, not just only in the storyline, but in the actual gameplay cycle itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tthe second reason we implemented habitat restoration is to expand on the Monster Hunter Stories series formula, where deepening bonds with the monsters is very important. In the previous entries, you would collect monster eggs from dens, hatch them, and raise them, but the places where you could get those eggs were very limited and were the same across all players. But for Monster Hunter Stories 3, by implementing this habitat restoration feature, every player will have their very own environment. So your environment and my environment might differ a lot. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">By restoring the monster populations and sending them off back to the wilds, you might be able to find some rare eggs with dual-element monsters, as well as Deviant Monsters. [Deviant Monsters] are popular monsters from the previous Monster Hunter mainline series games. You might be able to find eggs of the Deviant monsters by raising the ecosystem rank within the habitat restoration feature. We wanted to reward players for helping to protect the environment and restoring the endangered species and growing their population in the world by providing rare monsters that might hatch from the eggs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: In the first Monster Hunter Stories, changing a Monstie’s element worked differently, and was achieved by swapping genes to change their stats. Can you tell us the reason behind changing this method to the new one? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kenji Oguro: </strong>In the first Stories game, when you change the genes of the monster and get a dual-element monster, the element that monster possesses completely changes. So that might end up as a disadvantage for a player if you get the wrong combination. But for Stories 3, the team wanted to expand the user's options more and also make habitat restoration more unique. So they implemented habitat restoration and by raising the ecosystem rank and getting the rare eggs, you are rewarded with the dual-element monster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Stories 3, the dual-element monster will retain their original element. So if the original monster has a fire element, they will keep the fire element, and on top of that, they'll get their second new element. So in the combat, players might want to keep the original fire element and get a new element on top.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This gives players an advantage and more options when they are forming their parties. Usually for RPG games, players tend to go for the strongest character or strongest monster with the highest stats and abilities. But developing Monster Stories 3, with the dual-element feature, you get special monsters with different appearances. One of [my] favorites is the Velocidrome imbued with the dragon element. So you get a pitch black Velocidrome, very badass. And that was [my] favorite monster within the development cycle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After finding [my] favorite dual-element monster, [I] found that, "Hey, maybe I can just play with my favorite monster instead of focusing on the stats or the ability skills." So that's one of the ways that the players can enjoy the game. It's not just going for the strongest, most powerful monsters, but instead finding a true partner that you love and want to bond with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I played the Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflections demo, and I did notice that the Long Sword was added to this game. It hasn't been in Monster Hunter Stories yet. But I didn't see the Sword and Shield in my bag. Can you tell me if the Sword and Shield is in Monster Hunter Stories 3, and why you decided to add the Long Sword?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Daisuke Wakahara: </strong>So first off, we implemented the Long Sword because the Long Sword itself throughout the Monster Hunter series is very popular amongst hunters and riders. However, we did have some trouble implementing the weapon itself into the RPG formula in the previous games. But in Monster Hunter Stories 3, we were able to come up with a formula to have the Long Sword join the weapon roster.</p><p>In terms of Sword and Shield, unfortunately, it is not going to be included in Monster Hunter Stories 3.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in terms of Sword and Shield, unfortunately, it is not going to be included in Monster Hunter Stories 3 this time around. The reason why we came to this decision is because we had to carefully think about the weapon balance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When looking at the overall weapon roster for Stories 3, we have Slash, Blunt, and Piercing weapon types. And having both Long Sword and Sword and Shield would change the roster to go towards the Slash weapon types a little too heavily, so we had to take out the Sword and Shield from the roster, unfortunately.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The main character this time around is more of an adult than the previous protagonists in the Monster Hunter Stories series. Can you tell me why you made that decision to make the protagonist more mature this time around?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takahiro Kawano: </strong>We wanted to differentiate this with the previous entry stories, Monster Hunter Stories and Monster Hunter Stories 2, where the focus was on a child growing into a young adolescent. We decided to start the story off with a full-grown adult as the elite rider. So in terms of the setting for Monster Hunter Stories 3,  the protagonist actually starts off already grown up as a prince or a princess of Azuria, and is an elite rider.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is there anything else you want to say to the fans watching before we let you go?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takahiro Kawano: </strong>As you've seen in the video, we put a lot of effort into the background character designs for Monster Hunter Stories 3. So we’d like to have the players have fun and enjoy the beautiful scenery and the characters in Monster Hunter Stories 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Daisuke Wakahara:</strong> Thank you to all the players for supporting the Monster Hunter Stories series from the first title. You'll be surprised at how much the Monster Hunter Stories series has evolved throughout Stories 2 and the newest entry, Monster Hunter Stories 3. We are very confident in this game and that any player can enjoy it as an RPG title. So even if you haven't tried out the Monster Hunter Stories series yet, we highly encourage new players to try out the Monster Hunter Stories series. </p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p><strong>Kenji Oguro:</strong> [I’ve] played through Monster Hunter Stories 3 10 to 20 times during the development process. And every time I go through the gameplay, there's something new that the player can find. I’m very surprised that there's many, many cards up the development team’s sleeves. So we highly encourage you, the players, to have fun with the game. </p><p>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on March 12, 2026. You can play a free trial right now featuring a huge portion of the first area, Azuria, and continue your progress in the full release.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Casey DeFreitas is Deputy Editor of Guides at IGN, and is a first fleet Monster Hunter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Wrestler provided motion capture for the latest DLC.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">On March 17, Street Fighter 6 is getting a new DLC character: the pro wrestling-inspired Alex, and All Elite Wrestling's own Kenny Omega is the man behind the motion capture. At IGN Fan Fest 2026, he explained how the opportunity to do the motion capture actually came out of a simple misunderstanding. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When the news broke and they told me, we signed the NDAs and we know who the characters are and Alex will, in fact, be one of them. And they said, 'For you being such a good sport, it'd be cool if we put a move of yours in,' maybe one or two or a taunt or something," Omega told IGN. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I had said, 'Wow, that would be great. I just don't know when I could fit that into my schedule to do the mocap for it.' And they'd said, 'Oh, wait, you do the mocap for it?' I said, 'Yeah, is that what you were talking about, or no?' They said, 'Oh my, if you would do the mocap for it, that would be awesome.' And so a misunderstanding on my part is what led to me actually going to the studio and doing a slew of mocap for the character. If there was ever a better time to be stupid, that was one of them, because it worked out in my favor completely to not understand what they were talking about at that moment. So because of that one discussion, I got invited back to the next year's Tokyo Game Show. And then before doing the game show, I stopped over at Osaka, where they do the mocap for Capcom. And we hammered it out in one day. It was a grueling 10- or 11-hour shoot. I remember losing like 8 or 9 pounds of water weight, but it was so worth it and so fun." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also revealed that the developers were open to suggestions – he can see how his ideas were incorporated into the final game animations – and that wrestling without an audience wasn't as alien of an experience as people might expect. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think because of COVID, I got used to wrestling and performing in front of no one. It reminded me of being back into an empty arena and just having cameras all around me, but there's no sound. There's no adulation. There's no people. I see staff here and there, but it brought back memories of the COVID era, for sure."   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alex first appeared in 1997 Street Fighter III: New Generation in arcades. Early concept art shows the professional wrestler character was initially positioned as the new face of the franchise. In Street Fighter 6, his super moves include Raging Spear, Sledgecross Hammer, and The Final Prison. He also has an alternate level 2 super called the Omega Wing Buster, which is a sequence of moves inspired by Kenny Omega's own trio of signature moves, including the V-Trigger, Snap Dragon Suplex, and of course, the One Winged Angel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is just the latest news from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-fan-fest-2026-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect"><u>IGN's Fan Fest 2026</u></a> – check the schedule to see what else is coming and to keep up to date on all the latest from the worlds of games and entertainment.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Head of Editorial Development at IGN and an elder millennial.
