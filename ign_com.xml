            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/why-a-new-domain-discovery-is-getting-persona-4-fans-excited-for-a-possible-remake<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After the success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, it's easy to see why fans would hope for Atlus to move ahead to its next entry in the Persona series. Now, with the discovery of a domain registration, hopes that we'll see a Persona 4 remake are that much higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/ScrambledFaz/status/1902715312379752726" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber Faz</a>, a domain for "p4re.jp" was recently registered. While normally not something to get excited about, Faz noted that several years ago, "p3re.jp" was registered a few months before the official reveal of Persona 3 Reload.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>p4re. jp was registered a few hours ago.</p><p>2 years ago, p3re. jp was registered. 3 months later Persona 3 Reload was revealed <a href="https://t.co/FjuhAkr76q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/FjuhAkr76q</a></p></div>— Faz (@ScrambledFaz) <a href="https://twitter.com/ScrambledFaz/status/1902715312379752726?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Rumors of a Persona 4 remake have <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/persona-4-remake-reportedly-in-development-reliable-sega-leaker-wait-a-while/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swirled around the gaming sphere</a> for a while, but a domain does lend a bit more credence to the idea. Though it's not the only older game in the Persona series that could use a refresh — the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/24/persona-2-innocent-sin-review">Persona 2 duology</a>, in particular would be nice to see — Persona 4 and the enhanced Vita port <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-4-golden">Persona 4 Golden</a> do hold a special place in many RPG players' hearts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona 3 Reload <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review">successfully brought the PlayStation 2 classic to new audiences</a>, becoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-becomes-fastest-selling-game-in-atlus-history-with-1-million-sales">one of the fastest-selling games in Atlus history</a>. Add on the eminent popularity of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5 and its Royal edition</a>, and a Persona 4 remake would make a lot of sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, nothing's been confirmed or even teased yet on Atlus' side. While a domain registration certainly feels like it could be the canary in the Persona mines, we'll have to see if this pans out or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Bandai Namco has announced Digimon Alysion, a free-to-play online card battler for iOS and Android.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details are sparse at the moment, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaoHerGig5w" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just a teaser trailer</a> and some more info to go off. Revealed during Digimon Con, Digimon Alysion looks to bring all the Digivolution of its card game to the virtual format, complete with pack openings and little pixel arts of the various 'mons.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DIGIMONALYSION?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#DIGIMONALYSION</a> project start!<br>New Digimon Card Game app development!<a href="https://t.co/1705zU70rJ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/1705zU70rJ</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DigimonCardGame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#DigimonCardGame</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DigimonTCG?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#DigimonTCG</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Digimon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Digimon</a> <a href="https://t.co/u4VWfnDt9Y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/u4VWfnDt9Y</a></p>— Official Digimon Card Game English Version (@digimon_tcg_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/digimon_tcg_EN/status/1902577275540816119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Fans also got a look at some characters who may play a role in some sort of story. Again, details are scarce, but the introduction of several named characters and Digimon do seem to indicate there could be a story aspect here, which would be a bit different from the narratively sparse Pokemon TCG Pocket.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No release date has been set yet, though <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/free-to-play-online-card-game-digimon-alysion-announced-for-ios-android" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gematsu</a> reported that a closed beta test is planned with details to come at a later date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering how massive Pokémon TCG Pocket has become, Digimon Alysion could be a good play for those who want some more Digimon card battling in their lives. Over on the Pokémon front, the developers <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-confirms-changes-to-much-loathed-trading-system-are-coming-eventually">have confirmed changes are coming to Pokemon TCG Pocket's maligned trading system</a>, though it may take a while for them to be implemented.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Digimon Alysion, for whatever it's worth, does seem to be aiming to port its card game over to more people. Maybe the time is ripe for the Poké-Digi rivalry to reignite. Or, at the very least, fans of collecting cards based around fun monsters will not be hurting for options. We'll learn more as Digimon Alysion ramps towards an eventual launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
