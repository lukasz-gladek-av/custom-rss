With Fortnite's Chapters (essentially, the game's annual eras) typically lasting 12 months, fans believe a Mini-Season 2 is therefore likely at some point before the Chapter's expected end in December. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, as Fortnite kicks off its big Halloween celebrations, an in-game glider item has been spotted featuring The Simpsons' alien duo Kang and Kodos, with its description even referencing a dedicated battle pass.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">FORTNITE SIMPSONS GLIDER LEAKED <a href="https://t.co/UfWGDw1vrZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/UfWGDw1vrZ</a></p>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/1976199725121716706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">This glider marks the first time any character from The Simpsons has appeared in Fortnite, which has to date already collaborated with pretty much every major Disney-owned property (including characters from Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Avatar, and fellow Fox-owned franchises such as Family Guy). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reportedly, Kang and Kodos will be a free quest reward given to players in the near future — likely as a teaser for the game's upcoming The Simpsons extravaganza, and perhaps a nod to the show's own annual Halloween celebrations, Treehouse of Horror.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Simpsons itself recently began its 37th season with an episode in which Marge reminisced about the '90s, while Homer reflected on the pace of movies ending up on streaming platforms. Alongside the season's launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-simpsons-isnt-changing-to-do-big-topical-things-like-south-park-cause-the-topical-is-so-chaotic-and-nuts">The Simpsons' co-showrunner Matt Selman said the show's creators had no desire for the series to become more topical</a> "'cause the topical is so chaotic and nuts."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite fans have big hopes for Fortnite's prospective The Simpsons crossover, which looks set to arrive during the same year-end period that previously saw the game temporarily transition back to its OG Chapter 1 map (in 2023) and then a Snoop Dogg/Eminem-remixed version of its Chapter 2 map (in 2024). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could The Simpsons be used as a twist to revisit Fortnite's Chapter 3 era, or are players headed for an all-new map themed around Springfield? For now, Fortnite remains busy rolling out its busiest Fortnitemares ever which features collaborations with Wednesday, the Scooby-Doo gang, plus Ghostface from Scream. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last night's Fortnitemares reveal didn't go totally to plan, however, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-halloween-plans-get-off-to-messy-start-following-social-media-snafu-involving-doja-cat-and-a-sex-toy">rap star Doja Cat broke kayfabe to criticise the posting of a message, designed to appear as if it was written by her, that referenced a sex toy</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
