            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/entire-final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-square-enix-developer-reveals<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"With the power of the Switch 2, we can now recreate Midgar with full specs."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the latest <a href="https://youtu.be/Wm68MEd3d5c?si=r4ycsvT-HeDtJB2F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> in Nintendo’s Creator’s Voice series, Final Fantasy Remake series director Naoki Hamaguchi revealed that Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will be getting a Switch 2 release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Intergrade is the expanded PS5 version of the 2020 PS4 release Final Fantasy VII Remake, the first chapter in the remake trilogy that greatly expands upon the classic 1997 PS1 RPG Final Fantasy VII. Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade made some improvements to the PS4 version’s graphics and lighting, and also included Remake’s Intermission DLC, which centers on plucky ninja Yuffie’s arrival in Midgar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade is currently available on PS5 and PC. However, Hamaguchi revealed that with the Switch 2’s improvements over its predecessor, it will be possible to bring the game to Nintendo's handheld platform. “With the power of the Switch 2, we can now recreate Midgar with full specs,” he stated.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Being able to play this game on the Switch 2 in handheld mode means you can play it on the train while commuting to work,” Hamaguchi added, saying that the portability will also make it easier for people to directly discuss and show others the game and their progress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 version will also incorporate GameChat, enabling players to talk to friends while playing and share their screens in real time. “I’m very excited to see this game playable on a portable system,” Hamaguchi enthused, adding that “I have high hopes that we can build a strong partnership between Nintendo and the Final Fantasy brand.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although only Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade has been confirmed for Switch 2 so far, Hamaguchi ended with, “I hope players are looking forward to the Final Fantasy VII Remake series on Switch 2,” suggesting that Rebirth and the upcoming final entry in the trilogy will also see Switch 2 releases in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the Final Fantasy series originally started out on Nintendo consoles, before switching to the PlayStation 1 and its CD-ROM format for Final Fantasy VII, the first 3D entry, in 1997. With the remake, it seems that FFVII will finally be available on Nintendo hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/every-noteworthy-character-in-gta-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A who's who of Vice City.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar may have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">delayed Grand Theft Auto 6 to May 26, 2026</a>, but the studio has surprised everybody with a new trailer loaded with story and character details. While we knew from the first trailer that GTA 6 would feature two protagonists, it mostly set the stage for a return to Vice City. But with the newest trailer, Vice City gets a little more full thanks to a bevy of new faces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While their full roles and personalities might still be a mystery, the new trailer and the updated official GTA 6 website shares just enough that we now have a rough outline of who some of these friendly faces are. So read on for every GTA 6 character we’ve seen so far.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Every Important GTA 6 Character We’ve Seen So Far</strong></h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Jason Duval</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/jason-duval-04-1746540363699.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Jason Duval. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first protagonist in our Bonnie and Clyde duo is Jason Duval, a man who’s looking for the easy life but can’t seem to catch a break. After serving time in the Army, he’s in the Leonida Keys working odd jobs for the local drug runners. The only thing keeping him going is his love for Lucia.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Lucia Caminos</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/lucia-caminos-06-1746540461266.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lucia Caminos. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the start of the trailer, we meet Lucia just as she’s released from Leonida Penitentiary, having served time after fighting for her family. We know her father taught Lucia how to fight from a young age and that their family moved to Leonida from Liberty City (GTA’s version of New York City). With Jason by her side, it seems Lucia has a plan to give both of them a new start towards a better life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like past GTA games, GTA 6 is led by a couple of streetwise toughs hoping to find the score of a lifetime. What’s unique is that unlike the trio from GTA 5, and the lone wolves of older GTA games, Jason and Lucia seem to genuinely love each other, and that might allow them to reach new heights – or fall even harder than past main characters.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Brian Heder</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/brian-heder-03-1746540941114.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Brian Heder. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Brian is Jason’s landlord and one of the aforementioned local drug runners in Leonida. By day he runs and operates Brian’s Boat Works and Marina, but this serves as a legitimate front for his drug business for which he hires Jason to act as some additional muscle. He sounds suspiciously like the actor Stephen Root, but Rockstar isn’t sharing its voice cast for GTA 6 just yet (we asked).</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Cal Hampton</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/cal-hampton-03-1746540562480.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Cal Hampton. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Jason’s friend and drinking buddy at The Rusty Anchor, Cal is described as having “casual paranoia” and seems somewhat prone to conspiracy theories… but also having a good time, so maybe it all balances out for him? If Rockstar’s penchant for American satire continues, we can expect Cal to exhibit some of the worst, if funniest, parts of Leonidian society.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Boobie Ike</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/boobie-ike-01-1746540641301.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Boobie Ike. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A local Vice City legend, Boobie Ike is now a legitimate entrepreneur and business mogul, a far cry from his life on the streets. Boobie runs everything from real estate, a strip club, and even a recording studio which he is using as a launch pad for a new music empire with his associate, Dre’Quan. Keep an eye out for Only Raw Records’ first hit.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Dre’Quan Priest</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/drequan-priest-02-1746540704532.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dre'Quan Priest. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Boobie, Dre’Quan is a businessman whose primary job is gangster and drug dealer. He’s hoping to use his partnership with Boobie Ike and the talents of his first music signing, Real Dimez, to promote himself to the Vice City elites. It remains to be seen how much of Dre’Quan’s ambitions will end up helping or hurting him in his climb up the power ladder.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Real Dimez</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/real-dimez-04-1746540816790.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Real Dimez. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Musical duo Real Dimez comprises Bae-Luxe and Roxy, high school friends who turned their street toughness into a hip-hop and social media career. They’ve signed on with Dre’Quan Priest and Boobie Ike to capitalize on the success of their first hit, DWNPLY, to become Only Raw Records’ breakout stars.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Raul Bautista</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/raul-bautista-04-1746540887820.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Raul Bautista. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It wouldn’t be Grand Theft Auto without a few criminal masterminds, and Vice City’s got theirs with Raul Bautista. A veteran bank robber, his tendency to up the stakes during a heist means that his crew often has to deal with more than they planned for. Maybe one of his best-laid plans will be something Jason and Lucia sign on for to get their big break?</p><h3 data-cy="title3">And More (Various Gangsters, Cop in Body Armor, Influencers)</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/ambrosia-03-1746541721202.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Leonida Man and Woman. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of faces that get a brief appearance in the trailer who aren't named. From various gangsters who Lucia and Jason seem to have run-ins with, to, of course, cops looking to bring down Vice City's criminals. And in between are all manner of partying influences, gun store owners, and other Leonida denizens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the main characters we know about so far in GTA 6. Has anyone caught your eye yet? How do you think the two protagonists will stack up to past GTA anti-heroes? Let us know in the comments, and for more on GTA 6, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2">breakdown of the newest trailer</a>.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
