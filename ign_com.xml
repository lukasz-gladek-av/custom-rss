            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Castlevania? Now that's a name I've not heard in a long time. After years of making almost no video games at all, Konami has decided to get back into the fray with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">handful of new game announcements</a> in beloved franchises. Among the upcoming releases is Castlevania: Belmont’s Curse, a new side-scrolling entry in the long-dormant action-horror series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Belmont’s Curse is set to release sometime in 2026 for PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and PC. It’s already available to preorder for $39.99 (<a href="https://zdcs.link/9YRd04?object_uuid=3fb86236-e979-4777-8272-d6ec0f6e60c7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>see it on Amazon</strong></a>). Below, we dive into what this game is and where you can place your preorder. Let’s get to it.</p><p id="where-to-preorder"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to preorder">Preorder Castlevania: Belmont's Curse</h2></p><p id="preorder-bonus"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Preorder bonus?">Preorder Bonus? (Nah)</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As yet, no preorder bonuses have been announced. If any become available in the future (which does happen from time to time), this is where you’ll find them.</p><p id="what-is-this-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What is this game?">What Is Castlevania: Belmont’s Curse?</h2></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Castlevania: Belmont’s Curse is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/castlevania-belmonts-curse-a-new-2d-castlevania-game-announced-sony-state-of-play">first brand-new side-scrolling Castlevania game</a> since 2008’s Order of Ecclesia came out on the Nintendo DS. That’s 18 years! Dang! It’s published by Konami, but it’s being developed by Evil Empire, the company behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> and several Dead Cells DLCs, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania">Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania</a>. So they know their way around a side-scrolling action game. Motion Twin, the main developer of Dead Cells, is also on board in an advisory role.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Belmont’s Curse takes place in 1499 Paris, which is in the midst of a monster invasion. That puts it 23 years after the events of the NES game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/castlevania-iii-draculas-curse">Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse</a>. It’s not 100% clear if this is a “metroidvania” or “search action” game in the vein of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a> and the GBA and Nintendo DS installments of the early 2000s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of gameplay, it looks like you do plenty of jumping on platforms, swinging from rings, and whipping on enemies. Bosses can tower over you. Environmental hazards like saw blades are strewn about. You have access to additional weapons and abilities like a flame spell and a cross you can throw like a boomerang. It looks like fun. Watch the trailer above to see for yourself.</p><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">More Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">007 First Light Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/castlevania-belmonts-curse-where-to-buy">Castlevania: Belmont's Curse Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-where-to-buy">Crimson Desert Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-disney-afternoon-collection-nintendo-switch-2">Disney Afternoon Collection (Switch) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-nintendo-switch-2-where-to-buy">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (Switch 2) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-where-to-buy">Forza Horizon 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-where-to-buy">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-switch-2-where-to-buy">Pokemon Pokopia Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-where-to-buy">Resident Evil Requiem Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saros-ps5-where-to-preorder">Saros Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-switch">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-wwe-2k26">WWE 2K26 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

            <guid>1441003</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve played all of the God of War video games, including that one with the Reject Your Child quick time event, and that crappy mobile game from back in the Bush Administration. I played at least one game I only half remember of the God of War card game. I was a Kratos main in PlayStation All-stars Battle Royale. I like the guy, is what I'm saying, as a sort of cathartic avatar of the Id taken to its very tragic limits in Greece, and as a clunky conversation starter about guilt and finding power in something other than grievances in Midgard. But I can’t recall ever wondering “I want to know more about pre-Ares Kratos’ teenage years.” And as an answer to a question I would probably never ask, Sons of Sparta is a pleasant character rehabilitation of a largely unlikable guy couched in a largely boring adventure about Kratos learning the value of responsibility.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also a pretty mediocre metroidvania, clearly taking the form and function of these games but failing to meet the high bar set by the titans of the genre, let alone bringing anything novel to this specific experience. You’ll move through colorful locations, doing the kind of running, jumping, button pressing, object pushing, and monster slaying that will be second nature to your inner Belmont, but you’ll do so at a pace so slow that it makes the journey feel like aimless wandering, fighting through hordes of baddies with combat that tries too hard to be special but ends up crowded and cloying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I found this young Kratos to be a well-meaning, earnest guy piously (maybe naively so) devoted to the gods and the stubborn defender of his younger brother, Deimos. These are better times for the pair, who have just been granted permission to leave Sparta in order to adventure through and protect the surrounding lands at their own leisure. The well-written banter between them, and the other young people living in the Spartan agoge, reveals the Kratos that could have been, a charismatic, duty-bound leader that is tough when necessary, but also introspective, open to learn, and most jarring of all, funny.</p><p>Combat, for better and worse, was the most reliably compelling thing going on for a lot of the game. Kratos has a lot of offensive options but none that really resemble the God of War’s barbarism.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the brief moments of pre-Ares pledge adult Kratos in Sons of Sparta, who is telling his daughter the happenings of the game as a fable while she’s grounded, reveal a man who actually has capacity to love his wife and child in the present, and not just be consumed by rage because of their passing. They banter back and forth in the background as notable in-game events go down, and the way Calliope will cast doubt on the seemingly tall tales of her father, or follow up on moments that either seem contradictory or wrong was charming in the way The Prince attempting to recount his journey in The Sands of Time was.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, these don’t really save the story from feeling dull and rote. Sons of Sparta is full of interesting characters that you meet after long stretches of not very interesting travel and exploration. The many locations that Kratos and his brother romp through, like the fiery foundry of Daedalus or the dense and spooky Veiled Bog, look good but there’s nothing all that special or memorable about them. A lot of them seem to be begging to tell the story of what got them to the state they're in, like a haunted Winery that is covered in a goop and being possessed by Grecian Ivan Ooze, or a farming village where all of the residents have been replaced by cultists. But Sons is content with just marching you through a place in service of one long goal, to find a missing student of the Agoge, without stopping to elaborate on any of these side stories. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The around 20 hours of my journey was a lot of me wishing I could know more about a cool place I was in, knowing the best I was going to get was a blurb in the lore compendium, checking off every single Metroidvania trope without really any hope of seeing much innovation on the concept. The only “new” idea Sons has about the genre is when the player can expect to gain the signature abilities these games are known for. There's no explicit right or wrong time to gain mechanics, of course, but I went about 10 hours before gaining the ability to drink a healing potion and got a double jump a few hours later, things you might expect to do at the beginning of similar titles. But you spend so much of the early parts of Sons of Sparta running such rudimentary obstacle courses that every time I gained something like the ability to sprint, I felt like I had to wrestle through a fugue state to give it a fair shake. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">God Of War Sons of Sparta Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat, for better and worse, was the most reliably compelling thing going on for a lot of the game. Kratos has a lot of offensive options but none that really resemble the God of War’s barbarism. Armed with a spear and a shield, you'll mash a single attack string, poking and bashing enemies into submission. Normal attacks cause spirit orbs to float out of your targets, which fill your gauge that can be used to turn your blows into spirit attacks, doing less damage but generating health orbs and significantly more stun meter, which you want to build especially on stronger enemies as a stunned opponent is one that can be executed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I immediately missed the attack paths of the other series’, that let you mix light and heavy attacks or control tempo with delay strings. Instead, you can equip different spear shafts that change your combo-enders, providing one big damage attack but very few of which stand out from one another outside of this. One adds a Brad Pitt-style leaping spear thrust that gives your combo a little more range, but I didn’t find fussing over the right last hit to be worth much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, the real effective ways to spice up your damage dealing comes from attaching different spear tips that add passive effects. They unlock active abilities as you upgrade them. Not all spear tips are made equal and there are clear stand outs, like one that extends your reach. The reach-extending one’s active ability made every attack hit twice for a brief period of time. These have a more dramatic effect on your playstyle than the shafts, but I rarely strayed away from this tip as it seemed to clearly be the most versatile. I didn’t find many opportunities to get the most out of some funkier ones like the poison tip or ice tip, which do damage over time and slow enemies, respectively, as they’re effects never gave me a clear enough advantage against tougher enemies that seemed just as dangerous under these conditions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pommels can be added to the bottom of the spear to give Kratos another active ability, these being more like special attacks that spend your spirit meter to do. The differences between these were more dramatic - one allows the spartan to deliver a flurry of thrusts in quick succession while another sends him marching, spear swinging in wide arcs around his body. I changed these up the most to adapt to challenges because each felt tailored to handling specific sorts of the threats. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The most dramatic offensive tools are those that come from the gifts of the god that Kratos and Deimos invite themselves to possess. These operate like spells that, mostly, give Kratos options he can’t get from his spear and shield - namely good ranged options like Apollo’s sling that lets you launch pellets of solid light at foes, or Hestia's shrub whose leaves toss bouncing flames. They also double as keys to specific sorts of locks that litter the vast world of Laconia, Apollo’s light can power specific generators and Hestia’s fire can burn away prickly bushes. But in combat, they are often your strongest and most restricted tool, limited by a magic gauge that can’t be refilled through your attacks like health and spirit can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s quite a lot of ways to attack the enemies of Sparta, many little ways to modify these, and even more ways to grow and change these modifications through the upgrade crafting system. But so few of these options have remarkable gameplay consequences that incentivized me to explore past my early game habits. I didn’t even consider upgrading any of my spear tips past the level required to get their special abilities, and that was only just so I could see them in action. That isn’t to say the combat is easy, per say, but most of your most effective battle plan is to mash attack when able, after getting a safe moment or two to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enemies can be diligent and lethal, attacking often and in groups, requiring you to get pretty familiar with Kratos’ powerful defensive tools in order to survive. The parry is great for breaking up combos and putting stun damage on a foe, but it isn’t so strong that you autowin the skirmish after a successful swat, like some other games that might reward a good parry with a free execution. You still have to stay locked in, because the enemy will recover quickly to get back to the beating. Dodges, and the handful of follow up attacks that you can nail after, are necessities as well, and mixed together can make getting out of tougher binds feel rewarding. All of these actions can be modified or enhanced through equipment as well - shield rims can make counter attacks stronger or simply raise your armor and make you tougher to take down, for instance.</p><p>Losing in scenarios where multiple enemies might hit you with different kinds of attacks at once always feels like whatever the Greek word is for bullshit.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bad guys get a little too cute with the kinds of offense they can dish out, though. Most action games feature enemies who flash red to denote an unblockable attack, but Sons of Sparta can feature enemies with a whopping four different kinds of special attack conditions, modifying whether an attack can be blocked but not evaded, ones that guard break but can be parried, or ones that you can defend in no way shape or form outside of simply not being around when it happens. This maximalist approach to defensive Simon Says creates too many variables in combat with lots of foes, and losing in scenarios where multiple enemies might hit you with different kinds of attacks at once always feels like whatever the Greek word is for bullshit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boss fights turn the screen filling attack machine up to 10, which is definitely a change of pace They don’t start getting tricky until about the last third of the adventure, but those baddies make you earn through extended chains of pattern recognition and reflex checking bullet storms. The easier ones in the earlier in the game can be more disappointing on the difficulty side, but what all bosses share is that they further remove the opportunity to take advantage of many of your offensive tools, since they seem to be largely immune to status effects and don’t have stun bars. </p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Sons of Sparta does a lot of good PR for Kratos’ early Greek life, filling in the blanks of he and his brother’s early life in a sort of Young Adult coming-of-age story set in a military highschool. The fresh breeze it gives to the would-be God of War is more of a humid fog when it comes to the actual 20 hour game you have to play in between all of the fun character work. Combat makes the most attempts to differentiate Sons from other contemporary Metroidvanias, but is also mostly bloated with options you never have to even investigate, let alone consider. The rest - the exploration, collectible hunting, platforming - are at best run-of-the-mill, with very few locations and moments within them standing out in this game, let alone among the upper echelon of the best games in the genre.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-review]]></content:encoded>

Roughly 70 employees are going to be impacted by the closure when it officially occurs next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bluepoint Games is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community,” a PlayStation spokesperson told Bloomberg. “We thank them for their passion, creativity and craftmanship."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous report by Bloomberg</a>, Bluepoint was working on a live-service God of War game up until January of 2025, when the projet was canceled. The studio then spent last year pitching new projects, but ultimately was shuttered before it could get one moving.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bluepoint was founded in 2006 by former Retro Studios employees, and proceeded to work on a number of PlayStation games, including several collections of existing games such as the God of War Collection, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, and Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection. It also served as a support studio on ports of games like PlayStation All-Stars, Flower, and Titanfall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Bluepoint's claim to fame was its 2018 remake of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/30/shadow-of-the-colossus-for-ps4-review">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, followed by its 2020 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/demons-souls-review-2">remake of Demon's Souls</a>, both of which were highly praised by critics and fans. It wasn't until after Demon's Souls that Sony acquired Bluepoint in 2021. Under Sony's management, Bluepoint did some co-development work on God of War Ragnarok, but otherwise did not release or announce any new games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-pokmon-go-mega-evolution-revamp-interview-everything-thats-changing-and-why</link>
            <guid>1440997</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> announces a seismic shakeup of its Mega Pokémon, IGN has chatted with the smash hit smartphone game's developer on the inspirations for the move, what's changing for the better, and what the future of Mega Pokémon looks like in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Niantic announced the addition of a new, tougher Super Mega Raid tier with tougher battle mechanics but better rewards, a fresh currency to engage with Mega and Super Mega raids, and a fourth Mega Evolution tier for your Pokémon to grind for an unlock more bonuses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Niantic says Super Mega Raids will require upwards of seven players, who are strongly encouraged to bring Mega Pokémon into the fight in order to break shields thrown up by the boss during battle. New and existing Mega Pokémon will feature in Super Mega Raid battles over time, and will reward more Mega Energy once defeated. This will come in handy for levelling your own Mega Pokémon to the new Super Max tier, which provides further boosts and allows you to re-Mega your Pokémon every 24 hours. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, and perhaps most controversially, is the introduction of the new Link Charge currency for Mega and Super Mega Raids. The idea here is that this, like Max Particles, provides a separate method to access in-game content that doesn't just rely on raid passes (though you can still use raid passes for Megas if you choose). How exactly this will be balanced, however, remains to be seen — though Niantic says it will provide better value. Read on for more detail on all of the above in our chat with Pokémon Go's senior producer John Funtanilla.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hey John, great to chat with you again. Let's start with Super Mega Raids — is the pitch here that they're going to be the equivalent of Gigantamax in terms of difficulty and launch cadence? Will we really need seven or more players as has been indicated?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> Yeah, the mission with Super Mega Raids is similar to Gigantamax and we want to lean into the community play aspect of the game that's gone very well. We want to make sure that we're gathering folks and we have seen a lot of success with that — communities of sometimes hundreds of players in San Francisco going up and down on the piers playing together. That really inspired us and we know that was happening all across the globe. Not to say that there wasn't also some Trainers that also did low count lobbies and were challenging themselves to beat these Gigantamax battles with four or five players. We're very careful with the tuning and we were kind of surprised by that, but we do feel like if you're a really talented player, you understand the systems, you are able to do different strategies that beat these raids. For Super Mega Raids, it's kind of the same thing. We are targeting around a seven to eight player headcount to win, and that's pretty sizable, but again, it's related to how big your communities are, and being able to find the communities. I can go into it a little bit later, but I would say yes, expect same kind of level of difficulty for Gigantamax and there's some mechanics in there that require group play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Right, there's mention of shield breaking mechanics which sound interesting. I find Gigantamax battles fun because they do require extra strategy, but I know you always have to balance that with the fact your playerbase has a mix of hardcore players and more casual 'Korean grandmas'. You have to fit both those things, to some degree. So, were there any learnings from Gigantamax that you applied here to the new Mega changes?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> Gigantamax was such an ambitious effort. We really wanted to introduce a whole new system. As you know, there's the three Max moves, there's Power Spots. It was a massive, massive effort to finally bring in and actually unlock Gen 8 into the game. For Super Mega Raids, it's kind of an incremental approach. It's a little bit more challenging than normal raids, but other than that it does play using a normal raid battle format. We explored different mechanics and we didn't want to veer away to something that was unfamiliar to players — so we added different iterations on top. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walking through what this type of battle is, Trainers will need to bring in a Mega Pokémon — it's not required, but we definitely encourage you to bring one in to take down one of those shields. And when we're playtesting internally, people are bringing in Mega Pokémon, and when that last person comes in, there's this big climactic moment where the shields break. There's an amazing visual but not only that, though, there's a huge amount of damage that's done to that boss. And so you get to that powered up form, you're trying to chip away at it, you're yelling at other players to bring in their Mega Pokémon. If they were knocked out, tell them to relobby, heal that Pokémon, bring it back in. We really wanted to lean into that. And that's why I keep saying we wanted community play to be kind of streamlined for this one, it's less tactical than Max Battles but we wanted that excitement, that energy that comes from that moment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/19/super-mega-raids-key-art-16x9-1771519124281.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mega Malamar and Mega Victreebel will debut at Pokémon Go Tour.

There are ways that we try to alleviate that. So we've recreated the first time user experience, so this time we put the tutorial right in front of you as soon as you log into the game and that triggers and you'll catch your first Mega Pokémon. You'll understand the utility of it, you'll catch another Pokémon of that species to understand that you get more Mega Energy. So there is an update to this, but we've tried to kind of lift the total tide for the entire feature and include UX improvements. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think some of the big reasoning that we gave for actually diving in and improving the Mega system is that we felt that players — looking at the data — weren't engaging with Megas as met as much as we'd seen, especially for something as powerful and with as much utility as they have. That was the biggest thing — improving things all across the board so by the time you get into the Super Mega raid you feel prepared. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So unfortunately it is a scenario that can happen, but we're hoping that a player realizes that they don't have a Mega Pokémon involved, they back out to the lobby, they come back in and they're going to be that one person that breaks the shield. And I've seen that many times. So I think after players have gone through this a few times, hopefully they'll understand like, 'Oh, I should bring a Mega Pokémon in. I see everyone with their Mega Pokémon and there's toasts and texts that keep saying bring a Mega Pokémon in.' So yeah, we're making it easy for players to have a Mega Pokémon and reminding them to bring it in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And a quick one: is the reason the Primals don't count as Megas here lore-related? As they're not technically Megas?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> 100% lore. They're not Mega Pokémon. They have the same kind of power, but The Pokémon Company created the lore which is that technically they're not identified as Mega Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Let's discuss Link Charges, which are the third sort-of currency for interacting with battles in Pokémon Go, on top of the existing raid passes and Max Particles. Obviously people love looking at datamined information and drawing their own conclusions, and there's been conversation already around Link Charges potentially offering more activities to do for free but also being another currency to keep track of, and separately work within the limits of. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> I saw that reaction from players too. You know how it goes, players will see things with a limited amount of information, but obviously there's still a huge portion of the feature coming out and players are yet to experience it for themselves. I did want to set the perspective on that which is that we had a lot of learnings from Max Particles. So yes, there's the system where you can get a daily free raid pass, there's a system where you can engage with Power Spots and get Max Particles, and then we have Link Charges, which is the new currency. I think the biggest thing here is we want to give players access to premium content. We also want to make sure that we're encouraging and incentivizing engagement into our social features. </p><p>"When you use Link Charges in person, it's actually cheaper than using a battle pass..."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We just put out the Weekly Challenges. We have community check-ins, we love the gifting feature. Those are things we want to encourage and we see players engaging with these a lot, but those lead directly towards the Niantic mission. And with Link Charges, for us, these are ways for players to have flexible access to premium content. When you use Link Charges in person, it's actually cheaper than using a battle pass, so there is some kind of discount there. We always want to encourage IRL play and as long as you're doing some of the social actions I mentioned, we reward that effort. And with community check-ins, we understand that's a high value effort action. We reward that, we give you a ton of link charges, you check in, you're good, you're set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So you do get a lot of Link Charges and we learned from Max Particles to increase the cap higher. There are some other aspects where we understand that the content is very, very premium and it's difficult to challenge. So with Super Mega Raids, remoting into those does have an added cost of extra Link Charges, and again, it's like a balance that we have to form with the system. With economy, I think it all comes down to flexibility. If you're a player that doesn't want to pay too much, but you love engaging with the game, you love engaging with your community, gifting, things like that, we want to make sure that you have flexible ways to access that content. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Have you nailed down how many Link Charges you can hold at a time, how many you'll need for a Mega Raid (is it just one?), how many you'll need for a Super Mega Raid?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> The tuning will definitely be in different denominations than raid passes. Raid passes is like one for [a specific battle]. Link Charges are again like a currency. We're still tuning it, and that's likely going to be something that we're looking at as we're playtesting it internally, reviewing it with the team. Again, the stance we want to take is that playing in person will be cheaper, and it's going to be cheaper than a battle pass, and it's not going to require a battle pass. That's a fundamental part of the system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And I guess the same question on how much it might cost to buy Link Charges in the shop. Can you give an equivalent to buying a raid pass?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">John Funtanilla: It'll be better value, 100%. The final tuning, we're still getting to that, but better value is the main thing that we keep driving here. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/19/link-charges-1771519388676.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Your new Link Charge Holder. Image: Niantic</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>While we're talking raid passes, something I've come up against in my community is the issue with remote raid passes in Max Battles — where players sometimes fail a battle, can't rejoin, and don't get that remote pass refunded. Max Particles are only consumed when a battle is successful, but remote passes get used up regardless. Are you aware of this, and how will it work with remote battles using Link Charges?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> 100%. I think the biggest way to look at it, is we learned so much from the Max Particle system. We really pushed for Max Particles not being consumed until you win. Raid passes, meanwhile, are applied to the gym or Power Spot when you join the battle and that means until you win, you can keep trying. Max Particles and Link Charges [work similarly], so those will be consumed at the end of the battle once you win. That's a key learning that we wanted to carry forward. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For remote raid passes, I totally understand and that it might not be as favorable. There is still that leeway again that you can keep trying, though for remote passes you do have to somehow get back into that same gym and that does mean that the player, whoever invited you or if you joined their lobby, they've got to get you back in there. I do think there are some aspects to improve for that, but when we introduce new systems, we're trying to learn from that. We're trying to make it better. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're constantly talking with the player experience team for raiders, and they're looking at players trying to understand what problems are coming in. So we see that a lot and we try to build ways to reimburse if there's a crash, things like that. I understand it's not the best system, but we're trying to improve it with everything that we put in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The timing of these changes happening now feels interesting, because not only do you have the longer-term player behavior around using Megas that you mentioned, but you have the first new Mega Evolutions from Pokémon Legends Z-A coming into the game at Go Tour, with Mega Malamar and Mega Victreebel. Certainly from player behavior I've seen, Megas have felt like one-and-done releases which don't really benefit the community or new players — and it sounds like you've seen data that suggests they're underused too.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> Yeah... I mentioned earlier the core problem is that from the data we're looking at and player behavior, players are not fully realizing how powerful Megas are. You get that CP stat increase when you Mega Evolve, you can use that in raids, you get boosted ally attacks, you get increased candy. These are things where we only see the most hardcore high level players interacting with it. That's a problem. It's such a great feature. It's in its third or fourth iteration now, and so we wanted to bring that to the game. </p><p>"Players are not fully realizing how powerful Megas are..."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And for Super Mega Raids, it's the same thing. Is the utility of your Mega Pokémon worth evolving, worth bringing into Super Mega or original Mega Raids? We want to make sure you feel like your Pokémon are powerful and are meaningful. It didn't matter if it's a 1500CP Mega Beedrill or a crazy Mega Rayquaza. You both are truly important to the battle and you both can take down a shield. That was important for us, we wanted players all across that gradient to feel like they can come in and make an impact on that. And if you can't provide damage like a level 50 player, you're still breaking a shield, you're still helping the community. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there's the new Super Max level. This is just a start and I thing I can't really talk too much about right now, but when I say that Pokémon is invested in Megas, we are truly invested in that. We have a roadmap for the year. This is just the beginning of that rollout for players right now. It might not seem like there's a lot, but there's the Super Max level coming out and there's going to be new systems built on top of that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Part of today's announcement mentions that bonuses vary by Pokémon when Mega Evolving. Is that just due to typing, like a Grass-type Mega gives advantages when catching Grass-type Pokémon? Or will there be specific bonuses for specific Mega Pokémon, almost akin to Adventure Effects?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> You're asking all the right questions. I can't speak to a lot of that right now, we just need to have that space open and it allows us freedom to create different things there. We do have to leave it open-ended because if we want to design something cool and a different Pokémon at that Super Max level is different from another, that's something that we can design. I hope players will enjoy it with Super Max level coming out and understand that there's a much longer runway that we're kind of cooking in the lab right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One thing you have confirmed as forthcoming is the ability to spend Mega Energy to boost up your Mega Level. How are you balancing the cost there versus the lengthy process now?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla: </strong>Yeah, so to get to Super Max level will be a good chunk of Mega Energy and that's why I do think it'll be important for players to keep raiding that Pokémon and collecting Mega Energy to use it for that sink. For that last level, you won't need to continuously Mega Evolve, it'll just be one sink for you to spend your Mega Energy on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And then once there, you can Mega Evolve it every 24 hours without expending Mega Energy, right?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> That's correct. We looked at it, there's not a lot of players that get there. Some players are trying to optimize and Mega Evolve and they have a tag, but for the players that do get there, it's going to be rewarding for sure. So yeah, it is going to be free, you get that cooldown, you can use it again. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/19/gettyimages-2165351181-1771524578593.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go celebrates its 10th anniversay this year.

Are there any learnings there from the release of previous Mega Pokémon? It felt like it was taking a very long time for every Mega to release, and we got to the point last year where most of the remaining few were launched quickly to clear the decks for the Z-A additions. What can people expect the cadence of new Mega Pokémon to be going forward?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> It is crazy to think we've reached the end of the road for the existing Mega Pokémon —</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You are sat in front of a picture of Mewtwo, so I should point out that people are still waiting there...</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> [laughs] I know, what is this guy doing here? But yeah, the biggest thing there is that we took a look at all the features in the game. Megas were underneath the magnifying glass for us. We were trying to figure out what to do with this. Partly the reason for all of this was that we're were nearing the end of that [initial batch of Mega Pokémon] runway. But also we need to do some really, really exciting stuff this year and need to make sure we have the right foundations for that. For the new Mega Pokémon from Z-A, the DLC, there's such cool things to work with there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Super Mega Raids we can probably kind of map that to how a community might behave. I would like to see, around every one to two months, a big gigantic, Super Mega community raid day. We're still trying to figure out the best thing that works. The biggest thing to anchor it to is how we'd like to see people be able to interact with their communities. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>On Mewtwo, would the 10th anniversary of the game this summer be a fitting time to finally launch its Mega Evolutions?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> We have a lot to show to the players. You're kind of seeing all the foundations for that kind of being put down now and even in the last few years, almost in the shadows... All I can say is that the 10th anniversary for Pokémon Go, the 30th for Pokémon, means you can expect a really, really exciting year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <guid>1440991</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Third-person, team-based shooter Time Takers recently announced that a closed beta test will begin on March 13 and shared details about what you can expect from this first look at the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Time Takers is developed by Mistil Games, published by NCSOFT, and focuses on fast-paced matches where you compete for time itself. It combines elements of survival shooters and battle royales, but it isn’t defined only by kills, it’s about stealing or defending time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player has a lifespan that’s fueled by Time Energy, and it gradually depletes. Your lifespan is represented on screen as a timer ticking down. You can hold a maximum of 5 minutes and 30 seconds, and if your timer reaches zero, you’re eliminated. If you’re killed with time still left on your clock, you’ll lose some Time Energy but respawn. You can lengthen your lifespan by earning more Time Energy, which you can get by killing other players, defeating monsters on the field, or picking it up from spawn points around the map.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When you accumulate Time Energy, it will also fill your level gauge. As you level up, your character’s unique skills will be unlocked and upgraded in a set sequential order. Collecting Time Energy will also grant you a currency called Time Coins, which can be used to purchase or upgrade passive abilities on the respawn screen or at shops scattered across the map. At any time, you can manually sacrifice some of your current lifespan to add to your level gauge and level up. This obviously puts you at risk of dying faster, but it can be key to unlocking an ability you really need. You have to decide which is more important.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each match progresses through seven phases, and you can see your current phase in the top left corner of the screen. With each phase that passes, Time Energy spawn points get more rare and your lifespan depletes faster. Those spawn points also gradually get closer together, until the final phase has only one spawn in a specific spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This system means a couple things. For one, simply camping in one place is unreliable. If you do that, you risk watching your lifespan tick away with no way to replenish it. You have to stay on the move to reach spawn points or take out opponents frequently. Second, the shrinking spawn points force combatants into smaller spaces as phases progress. This also rewards players who pay attention to where the spawn points are in each phase, since you can come up with an optimal route to efficiently gather energy and level up as quickly as possible.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/17/onl-yokogawa-3person-highangle-0159-1771367038314.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">So in short, you’ll need to decide in each battle how to approach things. Do you want to minimize risk at the beginning, sneaking around the battlefield to gather Time Energy and level up your abilities without directly fighting anyone? Or do you want to go in guns blazing, hunting down opponents to steal their Time Energy as quickly as possible and put them on the defensive immediately?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first closed beta test will include 12 playable characters, each of whom have unique skills and playstyles. Matches in the closed beta will be in trios, with four teams of three players each, and you’ll need to coordinate with your team. You’ll each lock in your character and weapon before the match, with no duplicates allowed on the same team. Characters are grouped into Damage Dealer, Support, and Tank archetypes, but your choice of weapon can help define your role. For instance, there are support-oriented weapons that allow you to heal, while there are high-DPS weapons for close-range (flamethrowers) and long-range (sniper rifles) combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the match, if you stay close to your teammates, you’ll form a link. While linked, teammates acquire Time Energy simultaneously and can transfer it between each other to cover for someone whose time is running out. If you want to take advantage of this, it can alter your team’s weapon choices, passive abilities, and tactical approach.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/17/tt-006-1771367110243.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, if someone on your team wants to use a sniper rifle, that can give them a huge advantage if they reach high ground with good sight lines. But they’d likely have to stay separate from their teammates, weakening the link for the whole team. However, equipping the Link Repeater passive will cancel that out and allow you to link up no matter the distance. So unlocking that passive quickly becomes a top priority.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The combatants and battlefields are pulled from different eras of the past and future, and environments and conditions will change as matches progress. Momentum can shift at the drop of a hat, thanks in large part to Pods, which can spawn randomly and grant benefits to the first person to interact with it. Those benefits include temporarily pausing your lifespan depletion, the ability to launch a missile at a specific enemy, or a Weapon Exchange Voucher that will let you switch to a different weapon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The beta will include three maps: Yokogawa, Morstadt, and Miraesi, which represent the wide range of time periods depicted in Time Takers. Yokogawa is pre-modern Japanese themed and shaped by traditional architecture. Morstadt is based on medieval times, with stone structures and layered routes. And Miraesi is a futuristic setting inspired by Seoul that blends dense urban layouts.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/17/tt-004-1771367204142.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The closed beta will run from March 13–21, with 8 hours of playable time each day, and it’s focused on players in eight countries: the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Peru. If you live in one of those countries, you can sign up to join the beta through the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3596040/Time_Takers/?utm_source=ign&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=cbt1&amp;utm_content=feature_article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Steam page</u></a>. Sign-ups are open now, and it will still be possible to sign up while the beta is ongoing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don’t live in one of those countries, you’ll have a chance to get access to the beta through the Time Takers <a href="https://discord.gg/timetakers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Discord channel</u></a>. If you join the channel and invite a friend to join too, you can be selected to take part in the beta no matter where in the world you are. Head to the linked Discord channel above to get all the details.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/time-traveling-shooter-time-takers-announces-closed-beta-test]]></content:encoded>
