            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has said that Leon S. Kennedy is a "bad match for horror" amid ongoing speculation he is a yet-to-be-revealed second protagonist for Resident Evil Requiem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/brief-look-at-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-reveals-first-person-footage">fresh look at Requiem shown</a> during the publisher's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-spotlight-june-2025-everything-revealed">Capcom Spotlight 2025 broadcast</a>, the floppy-haired fan-favorite was nowhere to be seen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, his absence was made notable by the fact that Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi offered an umprompted explanation for why Leon, of all past Resident Evil protagonists, had not been picked as this particular game's star.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The protagonist this time is an intelligence analyst for the FBI, Grace Ashcroft," said Nakanishi, explaining that the new character was a good fit for Requiem's renewed horror focus. "She's introverted and easily scared, which is a new type of character for the Resident Evil series." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We wanted someone that experiences horror from the same perspective as the player," he continued. "She learns to overcome her fears throughout the course of the story, but she's also an analyst for the FBI who's trained with guns, and is able to act with calm deductive reasoning."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom's first trailer for Requiem, aired earlier this month, introduced Ashcroft and the game's returning Raccoon City setting in a manner that only fuelled the flames of fan speculation that Leon would also feature in some capacity. Indeed, fans were quick to spot <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-secretly-stars-leon-fans-believe-as-trailer-easter-eggs-and-actors-resume-potentially-point-to-his-return">a number of clues they said pointed to Leon's presence</a> — including his old truck, still parked outside the ruins of the Raccoon City Police Department.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil Requiem First Gameplay Screenshots — Capcom Spotlight 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Is the recent fan speculation around Leon's presence why Capcom has addressed his apparent absence now? Here's what Nakanishi said next, on the character's status in the game:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We always thought about making Leon the protagonist," Nakanishi explained, "but making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn't jump at a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he's actually quite a bad match for horror."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this Capcom ruling Leon out of Requiem? Nakanishi seems clear that the combat-tested Leon would no longer work as the hero of a game focused around horror. But the publisher also stopped short of ruling the character out altogether. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leon's status is clearly an important enough talking point that Capcom decided to include discussion of it in tonight's showing — which still showed only a fragment of the full game. With more than six months still to go, Capcom will of course have more up its sleeve to reveal. Could this all be some kind of ruse, and Leon still be a part of it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Recent entries in the Resident Evil series have taken different approaches to balancing horror and action — some to better results than others — but it's worth remembering how popular the Leon-focused, action-heavy Resident Evil 4 remains among fans. Could Capcom still be holding back a look at Requiem's more action-heavy moments, where Leon <em>would </em>be a better fit? There's still plenty of time left for the publisher to tell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem will launch on February 27, 2026 across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The second free title update for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter: Wilds</a> is imminent, according to today's Capcom Spotlight stream. It's coming on June 30, which we already kind of new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-details-including-release-date-leaked-by-playstation">given that it leaked earlier this week</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The update brings two brand new hunts: Seregios, from Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, and Lagiacrus. Lagiacrus is a long-desired returning monster from Monster Hunter Tri, and is known for its agility underwater and its rivalry with Rathalos. Though most of Lagiacrus' fight in Monster Hunter: Wilds won't take place underwater due to the player not really being able to fight while swimming, there will be some elements of the hunt that take place underwater, including some special interactions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the new monsters, there will be a number of other new bits. With the update itself on June 30, new features such as layered weapons (finally), new photo mode settings, the ability to swap handlers, a new collaboration gesture that involves a Fender guitar, a new free gesture set, new paid cosmetic items, and various other rewards and equipment additions hit the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On July 23, there will be a seasonal event entitled Festival of Accord: Flamefete. It will run until August 6 and feature limited-time equipment and other perks. And then on July 30, a new Arch-tempered monster, Arch-temered Uth Duna, will appear, along with its own challenge quest and equipment rewards (that are, frankly, gorgeous).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review"><u>Monster Hunters Wilds an 8 when we reviewed it at launch,</u></a> saying: "Monster Hunter Wilds continues to smooth off the rougher corners of the series in smart ways, making for some extremely fun fights but also lacking any real challenge."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter: Wilds' second free title update is completely free to anyone who already owns the game, and will drop in just four days, on June 30. You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-spotlight-june-2025-everything-revealed">everything else from the Capcom Spotlight today</a><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-spotlight-june-2025-everything-revealed"> right here.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has revealed our first look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> gameplay in brief snippets shown during a livestream.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the Capcom Spotlight event, Capcom showed a small portion of first-person gameplay, heavy on the horror and featuring new protagonist FBI Agent Grace Ashcroft. We see the character slowly move around creepy corridors with just a lighter for company. At one point, we see Ashcroft turn around to see a hulking humanoid creature close in on her from the shadows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In another clip of first-person gameplay we see Ashcroft explore a grand hallway, this time holding a handgun (as an FBI agent Ashcroft is handy with guns). She's also able to "act with calm, deductive reasoning," and we see her inspect a toolbox in the classic Resident Evil up close style to demonstrate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, we get a very brief look at third-person Resident Evil Requiem gameplay where Ashcroft is, once again, exploring creepy corridors and poorly lit rooms. We see that horrible creature again, casually stomping in the shadows.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During the video, Capcom developers explain how the first-person perspective makes for "tense, realistic gameplay," whereas playing in third-person via the over-the-shoulder camera lets you see "more of the action." The third-person persepctive is "great for people who enjoy action-heavy gameplay," Capcom added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem lets players switch between first- and third-person through the Options menu at any point during the campaign. Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview">Resident Evil Requiem hands-on preview</a> for more information.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil Requiem First Gameplay Screenshots — Capcom Spotlight 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, Capcom confirmed Resident Evil Requiem takes place 30 years after the missile strike on Raccoon City that occurs at the end of Resident Evil 3, which explains the enormous crater we saw in the announcement trailer. Indeed, the name "Requiem" was chosen because, as Capcom explains it: "This game is a requiem, a eulogy to those who came before."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no big Leon Kennedy reveal, as some fans had hoped for — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-secretly-stars-leon-fans-believe-as-trailer-easter-eggs-and-actors-resume-potentially-point-to-his-return">and even expected</a>. If the Resident Evil veteran is playable in the game, perhaps that reveal will come later. It's worth noting Capcom developers issued some interesting comments around Leon and Resident Evil Requiem in the video, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">which we go over here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem launches February 27, 2026, across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.

However, that doesn’t mean Capcom didn’t make the most of its runtime, with each segment featuring plenty of new information about some of its biggest upcoming games. Some standout moments saw the show reveal new gameplay in a ruined Raccoon City, while others came with a smorgasbord of new content coming to games like Monster Hunter Wilds and Street Fighter 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you missed today’s show, or if you’re just looking to refresh your memory, fear not: IGN has gathered all of the highlights for you right here.

Gameplay involves thinking on your feet by hacking and shooting enemies in an adventure set on a seemingly abandoned lunar research facility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pragmata launches for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S in 2026.

You can see concept art for everyone in the images above.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Capcom Talks Resident Evil Requiem and (Kind of) Addresses the Leon-Shaped Elephant in the Room</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A closer look at Resident Evil 9 means more details about protagonist, FBI Agent Grace Ashcroft, its gameplay, Raccoon City, and more. Although this was mostly an opportunity for the Capcom team to talk about some information that fans have already been made aware of, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/brief-look-at-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-reveals-first-person-footage">third- and first-person gameplay</a>, the developers did touch on one hot topic: Leon S. Kennedy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, it remains unclear if the legendary video game survivor will be playable at some point in Resident Evil Requiem, but the team did walk through <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">why it's hard to make Leon the main character of a horror video game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We always thought about making Leon the protagonist, but making a horror game based around him is difficult," Director Koshi Nakanishi explained. "He wouldn't jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing.
