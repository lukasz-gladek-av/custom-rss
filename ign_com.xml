As we head toward the colder months, The Pokémon Company has launched something a little different from the usual spread of trainer boxes and tins: An advent calendar. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pokémon Company started releasing annual holiday calendars back in 2022, inspired by the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Countdown_Calendar_(TCG)" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pokémon Countdown Calendar</a> from 2008. These products are surprisingly good value in the current TCG market, as well as for casual fans of the series in other forms. You can see the listing <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJvZX?object_uuid=6788315d-b24d-408b-9a79-5ddbff6d8653&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here at Target</a> or scroll on for more details. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The 2025 Pokémon TCG Holiday Calendar Is Now Available</strong></h2><div catalogid="52fdef90-ec91-4b42-ac20-af55f7149223" id="227412"><div id="227412" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Holiday Calendar (2025)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2025 Pokémon Holiday Calendar released on August 22 and is now retailing for $49.99 at Target. It quickly sold out at Amazon, but Walmart also has the calendar for a pricier $64.99. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It comes packaged in a rather large box that itself is significantly larger than any of the Elite Trainer Boxes. This year’s design features a deep reddish purple, white, and gold, with an image of Pokémon getting up to some festive holiday activities: Pikachu, Eevee and friends embrace the snow fall, while Darumaka cozies up to the fire pit and Articuno flies by in the night sky. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">What's Included</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Inside the box you’ll find, surprise, another cardboard box that acts as the advent calendar. The calendar features the full version of the festive Pokémon image with 25 removable sections where you'll find your gifts. These “25 surprises” break down as follows: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>8 foil Pokémon TCG cards with a festive stamp</li><li>6 Pokémon TCG booster packs</li><li>7 Pokémon TCG 3-card fun packs</li><li>2 Pokémon coins</li><li>2 Pokémon sticker sheets</li><li>Bonus code card for Pokémon TCG Live</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The festive stamp on the foil cards is the Poké ball version of a snowflake you’ll also see on the outside of the box. </p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/28/pokecontents-1756395227120.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As an advent calendar, these surprises are intended to be opened on the 25 days leading up to Christmas. If anyone manages to show that much restraint, you have my respect. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>What Expansions Can You Find? </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">What booster packs or singles you may find? Well, not knowing is part of the fun, right? But, for a little bit of insight, I’ve watched several openings of this calendar with packs from across the Scarlet &amp; Violet era, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-preview">Destined Rivals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">Journey Together</a>, Temporal Forces, and Paradox Rift. </p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 28, 2025 4:53 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-the-pokemon-tcg-holiday-calendar-2025]]></content:encoded>
