The "final epilogue entry" for the Light and Darkness Saga will have some unvoiced lines of dialogue though, due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-01-30-25" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>recent This Week In Destiny update</u></a>, Bungie said its teams have taken care to deliver the narrative and story content, but warned that certain voice lines will be silent due to the ongoing Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists strike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Subtitles will be enabled by default so players don't miss any story, and Bungie outlined a number of accessibility and visibility options for said subtitles. Heresy activities that have missing voice acting will display a warning before launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The SAG-AFTRA strike started last July after the union confirmed it had failed to reach an agreement with video companies following a series of negotiations. SAG-AFTRA cited a lack of agreement over regulating generative artificial intelligence (or GenAI) in projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even games not subject to the strike have been affected. Activision, for example, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-character-recast-after-players-expressed-concern-about-new-voices"><u>recast several Zombies characters in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</u></a> after the voice actors reportedly chose not to sign new contracts in solidarity with striking union members. Some projects and teams have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/voice-actor-strike-makes-progress-as-last-sentinel-dev-signs-ai-protection-agreement"><u>since struck an interim agreement</u></a>, permitting members to work on those games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The extent of Destiny 2: Heresy's lack of voice-acting is unclear, though some fans have noted that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1ih133j/comment/matavnf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>it appears Sloane will be one of the silent characters</u></a>. There's no note on whether these voice lines could be added in a future update, if the studio and publisher reach a deal with the striking actors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on how the strike has, and will continue to, affect the games you play, check out our feature from last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-sag-aftra-video-game-actors-strike-means-for-gamers"><u>What the SAG-AFTRA Video Game Actors Strike Means for Gamers</u></a>. Destiny 2: Heresy goes live on February 4, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
