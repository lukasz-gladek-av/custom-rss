            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In recent years, Square Enix has made quite an effort to remaster or remake some of its most beloved games and bring them to modern platforms. We've seen the incredible <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>, SaGa Frontier 2 Remastered, and Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles in 2025 alone!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, one game that continues to be left out of that conversation is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</a>, which released alongside the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-gifts-2025">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in June. If you're a recent Switch 2 owner and are looking for a new RPG to play, look no further than the fantastic game that is Bravely Default.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster for $29.99</h2><div catalogid="681de1aa-cde5-4374-8e89-64521fd58645" id="233911"><div id="233911" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>BRAVELY DEFAULT FLYING FAIRY HD Remaster</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has discounted Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster to $29.99 with a limited-time deal, which marks the lowest we've seen this game to date. Originally released in 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS, Bravely Default follows four heroes across the world of Luxendarc as they attempt to reclaim the world's four crystals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bravely Default is a fascinating game for many reasons. It initially was set to be a Final Fantasy game, but it shifted mid-development into its own game despite retaining key elements of the series. Revo, best known for his work as Linked Horizon for Attack on Titan, composed the soundtrack, which is still, to this day, an incredible RPG soundtrack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remaster brought new minigames, a refreshed UI, and other solid quality-of-life features like fast-forward, encounter rate adjustments, and more. While this is unfortunately a Game-Key Card, the download is only 11GB, so you will not need much space available on your Switch 2 to download this one. This is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-nintendo-switch-games">best Switch 2 games</a> you can buy right now, so don't miss out on this deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology. He co-founded Final Weapon, an outlet focused on nonsense-free Japanese gaming (in 2019) and has contributed to various publishers writing about the medium.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 29, 2025 10:47 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/save-on-bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster-today-at-amazon]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">We're in post-Christmas deals territory, which is a surprisingly good time to shop. Off the rip, we're seeing new price drops on pre-built <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-pc">gaming PCs</a>, which are becoming all the more popular given the recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concern-that-skyrocketing-ram-prices-driven-by-ai-needs-will-cause-problems-for-high-end-gaming-for-several-years">price increases on RAM alone</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has also bumped up its Pokémon TCG stock this holiday, but is anything worth buying? Of course it’s not. Well, there’s a handful of deals to be had, but the independent retailer army that makes up TCGPlayer is leading the way with the majority of the best prices on both the new and secondary market.</p><p id="tldr-deals-for-today"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" TL;DR: Deals for Today">TL;DR: Top Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skytech has dropped some cracking deals on a range of their prebuilt gaming PCs before New Year's Day, and we’re seeing RTX 5070 Ti builds for under $2,000 and RTX 5080 builds for under $2,800. Crazy scenes, let’s get into it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">iPhone 16e Offer From Metro by T-Mobile</h2><p id="amazon-pokemon-tcg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Amazon: Pokemon TCG">Cheapest at Amazon: Pokémon TCG</h2></p><div><div id="233887" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At Market Value at Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><div id="233888" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Surging Sparks Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><div id="233897" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Destined Rivals Three Booster Blister</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s great to see popular sets like <strong>Surging Sparks</strong> and <strong>Phantasmal Flames</strong> Elite Trainer Boxes crop up for less on Amazon, with the former being below market value alongside the <strong>Destined Rivals</strong> triple booster.</p><p id="tcgplayer-pokemon-tcg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TCGPlayer: Pokemon TCG">Cheapest at TCGPlayer: Pokémon TCG</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s strange to see <strong>Silver Tempest</strong> sealed product showing up on Amazon right now. Perhaps we’ll see more Sword &amp; Shield-era reprints on store shelves? Regardless, TCGPlayer has the <strong>Silver Tempest Elite Trainer Box</strong> for far less than Amazon, and the same goes for the <strong>Prismatic Evolutions ETB</strong>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPlayer also has the best deal on <strong>Destined Rivals Booster Bundles</strong>, currently sitting at $52.50. That means you get double the booster packs compared to the three-pack booster deal in the last section for less than double the price. TCGPlayer really has the no-brainer deals right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save Up to $460 on Top-Rated Narwal Robot and Mop Vac</h2><p id="skytech-gaming-pc-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Skytech Gaming PC Sale">Skytech Gaming PC Holiday Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering we’ve just entered a memory chip shortage across the board, with even DDR4 RAM going for silly money, getting an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-review">RTX 5060</a> build with 32GB DDR4 for $1,079 is a great deal. You’ll have solid 1080p gaming with either an Intel i5-14400F or AMD Ryzen 7 5700 processor to boot. Personally, I’d go for the <strong>Crystal</strong> build. It costs the same and gives you far more room for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-graphics-card">bigger GPU upgrades</a> down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking to go all-in with 4K gaming out of the box for under $3,000, the $2,799.99 <strong>Aqua</strong> build comes with a gorgeous clear white and blue case, complete with CPU liquid cooling, an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080</a>, 32GB DDR5, and the absolute beast that is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review">Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
