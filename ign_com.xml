The good news: to celebrate the upcoming video game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>, LEGO has announced four new Batman LEGO sets, and <strong>each one comes with a code for in-game DLC</strong>. They're all up for preorder now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bad news? They’re not coming out until March 1, 2026. But three of them are iterations of the Batmobile, and some of them may just end up in our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-lego-batman-sets">best Batman LEGO sets</a>.

Each of the Batmobile sets comes with a code for a gold variant of that vehicle in the game. The Batman Logo set gets you a gold variant of Batman himself.</p><p id="batman-logo"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Batman Logo">LEGO DC Batman: Batman Logo</h2></p><div catalogid="b7aa58a6-51ca-4d7b-900d-fcddcb0f0df5" id="229380"><div id="229380" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO DC Batman: Batman Logo</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I have a real soft spot for the Batman logo. I was eight when Tim Burton’s Batman came out, and that logo was everywhere you looked for pretty much the entire 1990s. This set lets you build and display the logo, with tons of “greebling,” or LEGO-y texture on it. It even has a hidden compartment where you can house a minifigure. It comes with a buildable stand, a regular and a gold Batman minifigure, plus a gold coin celebrating 20 years of Batman LEGO sets.</p></div><p id="batman-v-superman-batmobile"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Batman v Superman Batmobile">LEGO DC Batman: Batman v Superman Batmobile</h2></p><div catalogid="b7aa58a6-51ca-4d7b-900d-fcddcb0f0df5" id="229381"><div id="229381" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO DC Batman: Batman v Superman Batmobile</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From the universally beloved 2016 movie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice">Batman v Superman</a> comes this sleek, gray, angular take on the Batmobile.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda's long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> will include a character designed in memory of a much-missed fan, after a remarkable charity campaign that raised more than $85,000 for Make-A-Wish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Led by the team behind top lore wiki The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages (UESP), the effort will see former member Loranna Pyrel immortalized in The Elder Scrolls 6, after having created a forum-based roleplay campaign series that was inspired by Bethesda's games and went on to inspire the in-game work one of Ted Peterson, one of the series' writers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans had previously attempted to get Pyrel included in The Elder Scrolls 6 via <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/information-starved-the-elder-scrolls-6-fans-use-official-create-a-character-competition-to-come-up-with-a-release-date">a silent auction organized by Bethesda for Make-A-Wish</a> — only to have their group bid pipped at the post by another, anonymous entry. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After that incident, Bethesda agreed to bend the rules and let the UESP gang get a second shot — if they matched the auction's winning bid of $85,450. And match it they have now done, thanks to numerous donations from The Elder Scrolls creators, the UESP, and fellow fan resource The Imperial Library.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's kind of unbelievable that we got this far," the UESP wrote in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKIovJ5P-Xn/?utm_source=ig_embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on Instagram. "This whole thing started on an offhand comment about possibly teaming up, and then grew into this giant group effort. We're looking forward to adding this character to TES6. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We couldn't think of a more appropriate way to honor Loranna's contributions to both the Elder Scrolls community and the lore than a community charity fundraising effort like this while simultaneously making an addition the lore proper."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We just finished up a meeting with Bethesda where we got to design a character for The Elder Scrolls 6.

"Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days. Sorry folks."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Days later, Epic Games issued a carefully-worded follow-up where it said it had subsequently "worked closely with our partners at Warner Bros. Games to confirm there were no creative intentions to connect the Peaceful Hips Emote and the current Peacemaker storyline." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end result? "To avoid any confusion," the developer continued, "we're modifying the Emote choreography in next week's update." To some, the statement seemed unclear as to whether the emote was a reference to the show's own Nazi references. If so, why was it returning? If not, why was it being changed? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, today's big Fortnite patch (which also adds the game's Halloween event Fortnitemares, as well as a first nod to its highly-anticipated The Simpsons mini-season) has now made the switch, with the Peaceful Hips emote now updated. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">See the original dance emote and the updated one both below for comparison:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>DC Peacemaker 'Peaceful Hips' Emote will be disabled </p><p>"As we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote.

After a little sideways shimmy, each arm is then bent upwards one at a time — the movement seen by some as reminiscent of swastika. After that, there's a momentary touch of the thighs before the arms are placed behind the head and the routine ends with a generous double crotch thrust.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new emote replaces that middle section with a fresh movement — with clenched fists, an arm movement up and then down — that then neatly leads in to the remainder of the choreography.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a busy 24 hours for Fortnite, which last night had to deal with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-halloween-plans-get-off-to-messy-start-following-social-media-snafu-involving-doja-cat-and-a-sex-toy">rap star Doja Cat breaking kayfabe to criticise the posting of a sex toy reference on the game's social media account that was designed to look like it had been written by her</a>.
