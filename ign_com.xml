            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-swings-onto-steam-with-forgiving-pc-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s Marvel Spider-Man 2 swings onto PC today, January 30, and while the intrepid webslinger’s port plans have been in the works for a while, we didn’t know exactly how well it might run on PCs until now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-features-and-ray-tracing-options-detailed-out-tomorrow/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation Blog</u></a>, developer Nixxes Software shared all the fancy PC features available in the port, which has been developed to “finetune performance and fidelity across a broad range of hardware configurations."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Accompanying a new trailer, below, Spider-Man 2 on PC <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-you-wont-have-to-link-a-psn-account-to-play-some-of-its-pc-games-anymore"><u>drops the hard PSN requirement</u></a> for PC players and adds advanced raytracing features such as DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“In Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 on PC with ray reconstruction enabled, we see more detailed ray-traced reflections and better-defined ray-traced shadows, especially when viewing raytracing effects at steep angles," said Nixxes graphics programmer Menno Bil. "We also see improvements in the ray-traced interiors and less ghosting and noise in the ray-traced ambient occlusion.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also available are DLSS 3 and FSR 3.1 Upscaling and Frame generation technologies, with Intel’s XeSS upscaler also available. DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation is not supported out of the box, but using the Nvidia app you may be able to swap out to the newer transformer model to enhance DLSS 3’s Frame Generation image quality. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those looking to play using wider monitors, ultrawide support is available up to a staggering 48:9 aspect ratio, with all cinematics viewable up to 32:9. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/30/spider-man-specs-1738238762975.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Spider-Man 2 PC specs. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The requirements themselves are split between ray-traced and non-ray-traced configurations, which reveals that if you aren’t bothered about fancy reflections you can run the title at 720p and 30 FPS using a very modest older system with low-end parts like an Nvidia GTX 1650 alongside an Intel Core i3 8100 and 16 GB of RAM.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For gamers running higher-end rigs, you’ll also be able to make full use of your hardware, with the 4K 60 FPS configuration at “Ray Tracing Ultimate” requiring an RTX 4090, AMD Ryzen 7800X3D, and 32 GB of RAM.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But can Spider-Man 2 run on Steam Deck? Given the high RAM requirements and need for a relatively modern graphics card, it might be possible, but don’t hold your breath for Steam Deck verification. Spider-Man and Spider-Man: Miles Morales both had PS4 ports, which meant that the titles were a touch more scalable, whereas the previously PS5-exclusive Spider-Man 2 may demand more out of the hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, the wide number of configurations on the requirements have been praised online. One user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1id7g4t/comment/m9wy1fz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented</u></a> on Reddit: “This must be the best hardware requirements sheet I’ve seen so far." "Honestly, great job," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1id7g4t/comment/m9xjlc8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ItsMeIcebear4 added</a>. "If performance lives up to this, it'll be very well received."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sayem is a freelancer based in the UK, covering tech &amp; hardware.

Path of Exile 1's last league release was Settlers of Kalguur in July 2024. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://youtu.be/wF4rqnPoo80?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video message</a>, Path of Exile 2 game director and GGG co-founder Jonathan Rogers explained that the studio brought the Path of Exile 1 team across to help get Path of Exile 2’s endgame into shape ahead of the December launch, but thought that they would be able to return to get 3.26 ready for its mid-February launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It turned out that was impossible, given the myriad problems Path of Exile 2 has. “We were fooling ourselves,” Rogers admitted. Not only was Path of Exile 2 itself delayed a few weeks, but it suffered from crashes and balance problems that needed to be addressed immediately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“How could I justify taking some of the most experienced developers we have off PoE2 when it’s on fire?” Rogers said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is the Path of Exile 1 team is still working on Path of Exile 2, and will continue until Path of Exile 2 0.2.0 has shipped and probably a couple of weeks after that. “Unfortunately, I just can’t promise a date right now,” Rogers added. Path of Exile 2 is currently at 0.1.1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m really sorry for how this went down,” he continued. “Honestly, I should have predicted the fact that taking the Path of Exile 1 team off Path of Exile 1 would lead to this outcome, and I probably should have resisted doing it. But at every stage I just kept thinking, we still have time, we still have time. And then we didn’t have time any more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We still have a lot to learn about how to run two games simultaneously. We were overconfident. We still need to work out how to structure our studio to make this possible. But we do have a solid plan for what we want to do with 3.26.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The long wait for the Path of Exile 2 early access launch finally came to an end when it released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on December 6, 2024. It saw massive success, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-enjoys-massive-launch-becomes-15th-most-played-game-ever-on-steam"><u>securing its place as the 15th most-played game Steam game ever</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/path-of-exile-2/Classes_Guide:_Which_Class_to_Pick_in_PoE_2_Early_Access">which class to pick in PoE 2 Early Access</a>, plus an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/path-of-exile-2/Early_Mercenary_Build">early Mercenary build</a> guide and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/path-of-exile-2/Sorceress_Frozen_Explosion_League_Starter_Build_Guide">Sorceress build guide</a> to help you get started.
