            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop has announced plans to build a new Warhammer World in the United States with a late 2027 target for opening its doors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer World, in Nottingham, England, is the focal point for Games Workshop’s various tabletop games and a social hub for the hobby. It includes an exhibition centre with dramatic, large-scale dioramas featuring everything from famous battles in the grimdark sci-fi setting Warhammer 40,000 to the fantasy world of Age of Sigmar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For competitors, a sizeable castle-themed gaming hall lets fans play matches, often in scheduled tournaments. There’s a themed bar and restaurant, areas to paint miniatures, and an in-house store with exclusive products.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/u6jqjmvz/a-warhammer-world-in-the-usa-get-the-details-here/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Community</a>, Games Workshop confirmed its plans to start work on the new Warhammer World, to be built just outside Washington DC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This new Warhammer World will be a flagship venue that celebrates Warhammer in all its forms: gaming, painting, modelling, storytelling, events, and community,” Games Workshop said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The original Warhammer World in Nottingham, UK sets a very high bar. We’re not going to replicate it brick-for-brick, but instead build something equally uncompromising on quality and experience, something worthy of Warhammer’s rich settings and of course the title ‘Warhammer World.’ And of course, at the heart of all this is creating something extraordinary for all of you — the Warhammer fans!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now, there’s a lot to do – but with a fair wind, and the might of the Emperor and his inexhaustible armies, we hope to open the doors late in 2027.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With this new Warhammer World, Games Workshop is clearly hoping to reinforce its explosive success and the ever-increasing popularity of Warhammer 40,000 in particular, which in recent years has grown far beyond the confines of a tabletop game. Its loyal fandom fusses over lore, analyzes new novels for fresh insight into the setting, and speculates about future development. The smash hit video game Space Marine 2 boosted interest in all things Warhammer 40,000 — so much so that playable character <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-just-promoted-titus-from-space-marine-2-with-a-fancy-new-trailer-that-sets-up-the-next-narrative-expansion-for-warhammer-40000">Titus is now the poster boy of the tabletop game and is even at the heart of its next narrative expansion</a>. And former Superman actor Henry Cavill’s upcoming Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe for Amazon will undoubtedly take it to new heights. It makes a lot of sense to have a Warhammer World in place to capitalize on the army of newcomers Cavill’s Prime Video work will surely rally together. (Cavill once visited Warhammer World in the UK and posted a video of his tour on Instagram.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Warhammer 40,000 fans are bracing themselves for an announcement and release of the 11th Edition of the game, accompanying lore developments, and new model releases. And we’re arguably in the golden age of Warhammer 40,000 video games, with Space Marine 2 still receiving updates, Space Marine 3 in the works, and Dawn of War 4 and Total War: Warhammer 40,000 waiting in the wings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
