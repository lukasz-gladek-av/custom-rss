These codes are for you!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're in need of extra supplies and resources in Go Fishing, you're in the right place. Below, we've put together a list of all the active redeemable codes currently available in Roblox's popular fishing simulator, so you can get back to tracking down big catches with some useful new goodies attached to your belt.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/roblox-go-fishing-header-1741919187909.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Active Go Fishing Codes (April 2025)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Below, you'll find all of the currently active and working Go Fishing codes in April 2025 that you can redeem for free rewards:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>SPRINGTIME</strong> - 10 Luck Potion IV (<strong>NEW!</strong>)</li><li><strong>150KLIKES</strong> - 3 Giant Gifts</li><li><strong>GOFISHING </strong>- Cash</li><li><strong>ONEBAITONEFISH</strong> - Rocket Bait</li><li><strong>FREEBAITS</strong> - 10 Grape Baits</li><li><strong>50KLIKES</strong> - 5 Gold Baits</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Expired Go Fishing Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The following Go Fishing codes have expired and can no longer be redeemed as of April 2025:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>TODAYSPICKS</li><li>MERRYXMAS2024</li><li>CHRISTMAS2024</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Redeem Codes in Go Fishing</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/roblox-go-fishing-redeeming-codes-1741919187908.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To redeem Go Fishing codes, boot up the game and, once you’re in, follow the steps below:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Look at the icons on the left-hand side of the screen. In the row, you'll see one labelled "<strong>Shop</strong>" with a present icon.</li><li>Select the <strong>Shop icon </strong>to open up the storefront.</li><li>In the bottom left-hand corner of the storefront page, you'll see a code bar. Input your code here and then press <strong>claim </strong>to redeem it.</li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Isn't My Go Fishing Code Working?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If your Go Fishing code isn’t working, it’s likely due to one of two scenarios. The first is that the code was inputted incorrectly. Check the spelling and that the case is correct, then redeem again. You can even copy and paste the codes directly from this article over to Roblox if you want to make sure you’re inputting them correctly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other possibility is the code has expired or you’ve already used it. In this scenario, you should see an error message pop up below the storefront menu informing you that the code has already been redeemed or is invalid.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Get More Go Fishing Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">To check whether any new Go Fishing codes have been added, you'll want to become a member of the game's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/gofishing" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Discord server</a>. Once you're in, you can check the <strong>codes channel</strong> to see whether the devs have added any new codes to the game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Go Fishing in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to other major Roblox hits like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fisch-codes">Fisch</a>, Go Fishing drops you into a large open world ocean with a fishing rod and a simple goal. Catch fish, sell them for money, use that money to upgrade your gear and then catch rarer fish. Along the way, you'll visit a variety of unique islands, buy boats, and scrounge the depths of the ocean for the most elusive catches possible, attempting to cement yourself as the greatest fisher roaming the high seas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Callum Williams is an IGN freelancer covering features and guides.
