            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-true-horror-of-fortnites-skibidi-toilet-crossover-is-finally-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The dreaded and feared Skibidi Toilet has reared its truly ugly head in Fortnite at last. The rumored update officially dropped in the game last night, and so far it's prompting reactions of skepticism, confusion, and delight from the Fortnite community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First off, let's talk about the crossover itself. We first learned about it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skibidi-toilet-is-seemingly-coming-to-fortnite">earlier this week via leakers</a>, followed up by a confirmation from the official Fortnite X account of a toilet, plunger, and camera emoji in succession and a date: December 18, 2024. The actual update went live last night, and includes a Skibidi Toilet bundle on the item shop (discounted to 2,200 V-bucks at the time this piece was written) consisting of plunger pickaxes, a Plungerhead character skin, and two backpacks: one that goes with the Plungerhead outfit, and another that is the iconic Skibidi Toilet himself. There's also a lego version of the Plungerman skin.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">You know it. Now you can wear it! <br>Skibidi Toilet &amp; Plungerman. Available now in the Shop.<a href="https://t.co/DXMUbYvQLk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/DXMUbYvQLk</a> <a href="https://t.co/P8VUaJorLe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/P8VUaJorLe</a></p>â€” Fortnite (@FortniteGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1869534445272740000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 19, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That's it for the collaboration, though with the recent return of the original map and the Flush Factory, there's already a conveniently toilet-themed location just waiting to be flooded with Skibidi nonsense:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The addition of Skibidi Toilet to Fortnite is being met with some mixed feelings from the community. There are some naysayers who feel that Fortnite has gone too far incorporating the popular meme, suggesting it's juvenile and indicative of a slide into total absurdity for what's deemed worthy of a collaboration:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, the vast majority of folks seem to range from mildly amused to chaotically delighted, even the ones who have no idea what Skibidi Toilet is. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, the verdict of the Fortnite community seems to be that the Skibidi Toilet addition to Fortnite is a good time, at minimum because the Plungerman skin is pretty cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you, like some members of the Fortnite community, have absolutely no idea what this toilet thing is, here's the quick rundown: Skibidi Toilet is a series of web shorts by Alxey Gerasimov published on YouTube via Gerasimov's channel, DaFuq!?Boom!. And by shorts, we do mean very short - early episodes are only a handful of seconds long, and were created with Garry's Mod using assets from games like Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike. The series features a toilet with a man's head coming out of it set to a mashup of the songs Give It to Me by Timbaland and Dom Dom Yes Yes by Biser King. While early episodes are somewhat nonsensical, as the series progresses a plot emerges about an arms race between the Skibidi Toilets (of which there are many of varying sizes and with different heads popping out) and a race of people with video cameras for heads. The plot progresses from there, more recently centering on a cameraman named Plungerman and involving alien Skibidi Toilets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The whole thing, while absurdist, is far more complex than you might imagine just from seeing the image of the head in the toilet. In fact, it's got enough going on (and is popular enough) that there's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skibidi-toilet-film-reportedly-in-the-works-from-michael-bay">reportedly a film and TV adaptation effort underway from Michael Bay</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you love Fortnite but Skibidi Toilet is still a bit much for you, don't worry. The game gets so many constant collaborations, the toilet-fest will quickly be drowned out by the next big thing, which happens to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-leakers-say-mariah-carey-will-soon-emerge-from-a-giant-block-of-ice-in-the-game">Mariah Carey emerging from a giant block of ice to ring in the holidays</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-cult-classic-rpg-off-gets-surprise-steam-and-switch-release-in-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a piece of news I certainly didn't see coming in the waning hours of 2024, today it was announced that indie cult classic game OFF is getting released on Steam and Nintendo Switch next year in a new and "improved" version, including a physical edition.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar, OFF is an RPG that first released in 2008 from Belgian studio Unproductive Fun Time. It was made in RPG Maker, originally released in French, and has never received an official English translation, though multiple fan translations have sprung up over the years. It's also never been available on typical, popular PC storefronts such as Steam or itch.io, but instead has circulated over the years as a direct download, gaining a cult following due to how utterly weird, unsettling, and at times inscrutable it can be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">OFF puts the player in control of a mysterious baseball player-looking figure known as the Batter, who is instructed by a talking cat calling itself the Judge to travel through four Zones and kill ghostly creatures known as Spectres. The Zones themselves are haunting, upsetting places run by cruel leaders, composed of strange elements such as smoke, metal, plastic, meat, and sugar, and populated by confused and often suffering individuals who seem to be tormented by the Spectres. However, as the game progresses, the player is encouraged to question the actions of the Batter and themselves as a player, with multiple endings possible depending on the player's decisions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite never hitting the mainstream, OFF has served as an inspiration for a number of other hit RPGs, most notably Undertale (and most notably Undertale's absolute creepiest, freakiest stuff). The game is coming to Steam and Nintendo Switch in 2025 both digitally and as a physical edition via Fangamer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
