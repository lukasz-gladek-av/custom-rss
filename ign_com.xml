Now, <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj7OjP?object_uuid=598c4d84-7e3b-41f9-8a23-3996f0ebbbd8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>thanks to a discount at Amazon</u></a>, you can save on a bundle of them with two for each player.</p><div catalogid="9c49c368-32da-4b50-8933-c8afb62fb833" id="233732"><div id="233732" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Edge of Eternities Commander Deck Bundle</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Two of Magic’s Best Commander Decks Are Discounted Before Christmas</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only did Edge of Eternities mark a surprising left-turn into a space opera, but it also introduced two great Commander decks - Counter Intelligence and World Shaper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first is all about proliferating counters to power up your creatures, using Kilo, Apogee Mind to basically keep those tokens coming every time it’s tapped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">World Shaper, on the other hand, is all about playing lands to trigger Landfall effects, while also using cards to cheat them out of your graveyard for near limitless expansion of your army.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both are great decks in themselves, but this bundle nets you two of each for an ideal playset for two players just starting out in Commander. It’s down to $121.55, a drop of 32%, which brings each deck down to around $30. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given World Shaper is currently selling for $43 on its own, while Counter Intelligence is $36 (and that’s on sale), you’re getting a great deal here, allowing you to open up the decks and play right out of the box with a friend - or sell two of them on to buy singles to upgrade with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s saying nothing of the Collector Sample Pack in each, which includes a pair of cards in rare treatments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, this is a great deal for anyone curious about Edge of Eternities. It's also still the last wave of Commander decks from 2025, given they weren't offered in Spider-Man or Avatar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.

According to its president Andy Kleinman, however, Delphi has been working for the past 30 months "to continue the legacy of one of my favorite video games of all time, FIFA."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Delphi, seemingly established in 2023, hasn't yet shipped a game, but <a href="https://www.delphiinteractive.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>describes</u></a> itself as "the architects" behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> and "uncompromising about quality."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/18/fifa-netflix-games-1766054948356.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While we haven't seen any screenshots yet, let alone gameplay, a press release claims the game will be "fast to learn, thrilling to master, and built for anyone to jump in," and playable — either solo or online — without a controller, as "all you need is Netflix and your phone."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Football is the biggest thing in the world. As lifelong FIFA fans, we're honoured to help usher in the bold, next generation and reimagine the future of the franchise. Our mission is simple: make the FIFA game the most fun, approachable, and global football game ever created," said Casper Daugaard, founder &amp; CEO of Delphi Interactive. Kleinman called it "one of those pinch-me" moments and hailed the project as "a historic exclusive partnership to launch the next generation of the FIFA football simulation titles."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"FIFA is very excited to team up with Netflix Games and Delphi Interactive ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2026," added FIFA President Gianni Infantino said. "This major collaboration is a key milestone in FIFA's commitment to innovation in the football gaming space, which aspires to reach billions of football fans of all ages everywhere in the world and will be redefining the pure notion of simulation games. Our reimagined game truly marks the beginning of a new era of digital football. It will be available for free to Netflix members and is a great historic step for FIFA."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Partnering with Netflix and enabling soccer fans to get involved "with just the touch of a button" does sound like the sports sim will be more accessible to a casual audience. However, Netflix stresses the game will only be available "on select TVs in certain countries."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Netflix subscribers can <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/132197" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>presently</u></a> only play games in the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, Spain, Mexico, France, Italy, Poland, Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, Finland, Germany, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, that leaves a lot of soccer-loving countries without access. And while Netflix's CEO claims the game will be playable for "free," it's not entirely clear if this access will be paywalled behind certain subscription tiers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FIFA 23 is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fifa-23-eas-live-service-games-remain-a-money-machine-in-a-record-fourth-quarter"><u>the most successful game in the franchise</u></a>, despite the fact EA delisted from online storefronts when it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-delists-fifa-23-without-warning-before-fc-24s-release-date"><u>just a year old</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
