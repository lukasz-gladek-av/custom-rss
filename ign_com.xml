"Sonic Frontiers is an ambitious open-world adventure that mostly succeeds at mixing up the Sonic formula, even when some of its ideas fall flat," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-frontiers-review">IGN said in our 7/10 review</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Forspoken Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A PlayStation 5 exclusive, Forspoken arrived with grand promises of an open world full of magic but fell flat on release due to a lacklustre story, gameplay, and performance. "Forspoken’s flashy combat and parkour can be fun, but they aren’t enough to make its cliche story and barebones open world very interesting to explore," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forspoken-review">IGN said in our 6/10 review</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just in time for the holidays, party game Rabbids: Party of Legends brings mayhem to PlayStation through four player local multiplayer. "Embark on a legendary journey filled with colorful characters with the Rabbids in this uproarious party game," reads the synopsis.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">WRC Generations Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another entry in the WRC racing series, WRC Generations is promised to be "an authentic and comprehensive rally racing simulation, giving players the chance to drive powerful cars in the most famous rallies of all time." <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wrc-generations-review">It earned an 8/10 in IGN's review</a>, in which we said: "With its absolute mountain of rally locations, WRC Generations is uncommonly generous package for gravel groupies, asphalt addicts, and mud-slinging maniacs alike."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">F.I.S.T. Forged in Shadow Torch is described as a "diesel-punk exploratory platformer" where players must fight through intense combat sequences, overcome challenging puzzles, and interact with an anthropomorphic cast of vibrant characters.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Screens  -  Jurassic World Evolution 2</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When managing zoos becomes too tiresome, players can turn up the intensity by putting some dinosaurs on show. Jurassic World Evolution 2 allows just that: dinosaur park management simulation where players take charge of their own Jurassic World park. "While park management and customization aspects are a bit shallow, Jurassic World Evolution 2 has tons of excellent dinosaurs and exciting ways to interact with them," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-2-review">IGN said in our 7/10 review</a>.</p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2024/12/5cf60c15d992071250b45318795c2447f9384e22.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If that's too much, players also have the option for something cozier. "As the Barista in late-night coffee shop, Coffee Talk offers players friendly conversation and late-night warm drinks to the colourful and fantastical inhabitants of alternative-Seattle including elves, aliens, and orcs," its synopsis reads.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fancy a double shot? "Dust off your coffee machine and prepare your warmest smile to meet your favorite customers again in the second episode of Coffee Talk: Hibiscus &amp; Butterfly, a coffee brewing and heart-to-heart talking simulator."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another quieter game comes in the form of A Space for the Unbound, a 2023 game with pixel art and a heartwarming story. "A Space for the Unbound is a slice-of-life set in the late 90s rural Indonesia that tells a story about overcoming anxiety, depression, and the relationship between a boy and a girl with supernatural powers," its synopsis reads.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What's better than one dog? A two headed dog? Maybe. "In Phogs! you play as a two headed dog called Red and Blue. Linked by a stretchy belly, you’ll need to bark, bite and bounce your way through obstacles set across the themed worlds of Food, Sleep and Play."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More multiplayer fun comes in Biped, "a co-op action-adventure game that emphasizes real-time collaboration between two players" according to its official synopsis. "Guide Aku and Sila, two charming bipedal robots, through intricate paths leading to planetary beacons."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, virtual reality fans can this month enjoy Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge - Enhanced Edition. IGN called it "an excellent way to showcase the best features of a fancy new PlayStation VR2," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-tales-from-the-galaxys-edge-enhanced-edition-review">IGN said in our 7/10 review</a>. "The first few hours of the story are its Episodes 1 and 2 (bad) but then things turn around and immerse us in Star Wars greatness."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
