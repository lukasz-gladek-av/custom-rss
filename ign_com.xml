It developed the so-so Wii Party (not to be confused with the better Wii Play, which came with a packed-in Wii Remote), as well as the disappointing Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival on Wii U. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, Nintendo Cube released the functional Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics for Switch 1, before the infamous Everybody 1-2 Switch — a party game sequel launched with little fanfare that earned Nintendo some of its worst review scores in recent memory. ("Everybody 1-2-Switch might be the first party game I’ve played where I ended up with fewer friends afterwards," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everybody-1-2-switch-review">IGN wrote in its 4/10 appraisal</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's for Mario Party that Nintendo Cube is best known, having taken over as the hugely popular party game series' main developer beginning with 2012's Mario Party 9 onwards, and continuing with Mario Party 10, Mario Party Star Rush, Mario Party: The Top 100, Super Mario Party and Mario Party Superstars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Cube's next launch is (deep breath) Super Mario Party Jamboree: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV, a Switch 2 update for Super Mario Party Jamboree that makes use of the new console's mouse controls and optional camera peripheral, due to arrive on July 24.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While a budget-priced release, criticism was levelled at Welcome Tour for the sheer number of its mouse-control games, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-which-everyone-thinks-should-be-free-requires-95-of-accessories-and-a-4k-tv-for-100-completion">the need to have a camera peripheral, a Switch 2 Charging Grip or Pro Controller, and a 4K TV to see everything it had to offer</a>, and complete the game with gold medals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Even if Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour were the pack-in game it feels like it was meant to be, the execution of its charming concept is a muddled collection of quaint tech demos and boring factoids dressed up as an uncompelling completionist checklist," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-review">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
