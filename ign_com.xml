The quality is good enough that, while scrolling on social media, you'd think it was a legimate clip from YouTube or Twitch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Technically, Veo 3 should not be infringing on anyone's copyrighted material — and it's safe to assume Fortnite developer Epic Games did not sign this one off. But clearly the AI tool has had access to the millions of hours of Fortnite gameplay posted online, and is now able to reproduce a convincing representation on command.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One <a href="https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/1924994290729599222" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clip</a>, showing a streamer celebrating as they win a match using only their pickaxe, was apparently created within Veo 3 using a text-based prompt of nine words: "Streamer getting a victory royale with just his pickaxe".</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Uhhh... I don't think Veo 3 is supposed to be generating Fortnite gameplay <a href="https://t.co/bWKruQ5Nox" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/bWKruQ5Nox</a></p>— Matt Shumer (@mattshumer_) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattshumer_/status/1924994290729599222?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In writing this prompt, Veo 3 has not been told specifically to create Fortnite gameplay. Still, it understands from the context what game the user is referring to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Veo 3's abilities throw up all sorts of questions, and far more pressing ones than simple copyright concerns. The ability to create footage like this undoubtedly aids users looking to fool others with disinformation, and in so doing undermine trust in legitimate footage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can not tell if this is real or not," reads one reply. "We're cooked," reads another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The only way this is possible is if Veo 3 was trained on an enormous amount of Fortnite content," a third reply reads. "Wouldn’t be surprised if everything that gets uploaded to YouTube is now being trained on despite copyright laws."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Epic for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a better look at what Veo 3 is capable of outside of video games, here's a clip of the algorithm creating a fake news report on an automobile trade show that doesn't exist, with fake interviewees answering fake questions.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Before you ask: yes, everything is AI here. The video and sound both coming from a single text prompt using <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Veo3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Veo3</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleDeepMind?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@GoogleDeepMind</a> .Whoever is cooking the model, let him cook!

Xbox boss Phil Spencer suggested Muse could be used to help ideate game concepts in the future, and even somehow aid in game preservation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Muse's reveal, quickly followed by the reveal of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-quake-2-ai-prototype-sparks-debate-online">more fake gameplay footage generated by Muse of the classic shooter Quake 2</a>, has prompted further debate — and raised questions over whether the tool would remove work or replace human creativity from existing employees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite is no stranger to AI itself, of course. Last week, the game added the ability to chat with Star Wars' Darth Vader, who will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-has-only-been-live-for-an-hour-and-already-epic-has-patched-out-him-saying-fk">reply using generative AI trained on the voice of the late James Earl Jones</a>. Jones' voice is officially licensed (and was previously used to create dialogue for Disney's own Obi Wan Kenobi TV series) and sanctioned by both the late actor and his family, but the addition still prompted <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/voice-actor-union-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-over-fortnites-ai-darth-vader">swift condemnation and an unfair labor practice charge from acting union SAG-AFTRA</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

You can also hunt for codes in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/UKBB4mtHVP" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dediated Discord server</a>, where codes are also announced.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Isn't My Dead Spells Codes Working?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If your code for Dead Spells isn't working, it's likely for one of two reasons:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>The code has been entered incorrectly</li><li>The code has expired</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph">If a code is not accepted in Dead Spells, it will say "code does not exist or is expired." It doesn't make it clear what the problem is, you'll just know the code hasn't worked. The good news is, if you use our article, we'll move codes into expired when they stop working, so you can tell the difference. If a code is in the active and working list, however, be sure to copy and paste it exactly as you see it here. We test each of the codes before uploading them, and Roblox codes are often case-sensitive, so it's important that it's exact. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
