That’s why I know they’re in later stages of productization</p></div>— Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1858925211363553316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 19, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">We don't have too many details on controller specifics, but Lynch did say in replies on X/Twitter that it will look like a standard gamepad. The biggest change is reportedly the shape and size of the trackpads "to get into that gamepad-y form." It will also allegedly have symmetrical sticks.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/07/24/valve-steam-controller-redesign8000cinema12800jpg-8dd5b8.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Valve's Steam controller.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Lynch said Valve seems to be working on a new VR controller also for mass production, codenamed "Roy." Roy is apparently referenced in Valve's SteamVR code, and would supposedly be a wand-shaped companion to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-stream-deckard-standalone-vr-headset-rumor">rumored wireless "Deckard" headset</a> that's also reportedly in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roy would reportedly double as a Steam Controller gamepad when not being used with VR, including a D-pad, shoulder buttons, and a set of ABXY buttons for more traditional gameplay in addition to its motion and VR functionality.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Valve Roy controller(s) have at least: DPAD, Bumpers, Grip Buttons, Triggers, ABXY, system button, and some sort of strap</p><p>I am confident in this info based on datamining AND sources who wished not to be named</p><p>There is also an unreleased OpenXR extension for these controllers <a href="https://t.co/36WBtLvYZ5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/36WBtLvYZ5</a></p></div>— Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1857153531897131182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 14, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">While it's unclear when either of these products will be in our hands, Lynch alluded in one post that it's unlikely Deckard specifically is a holiday 2024 release. The headset has allegedly been in the works for some time and was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-stream-deckard-standalone-vr-headset-rumor">first reported on in 2021</a>. Though Valve already released one VR headset in 2019, the Index, it requires multiple base station sensors and connection to a PC. Deckard allegedly would be standalone, more akin to a Meta Quest headset, making it a more accessible (and theoretically more affordable) option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Steam Controller 2, while we're still short on details, fans are hopeful its control scheme and customizability will be reminiscent of the Steam Deck handheld, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-oled-review">got a fancier OLED model just last year</a>. IGN has reached out to Valve for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social.

The new Star Wars game has been discounted in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-2024-when-will-the-sale-start-this-year">Black Friday sales</a>, now down to <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMvVeL?object_uuid=f691f518-3b61-47e9-b5e3-5fb07e34874f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$49.99 on PS5</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9g3l0n?object_uuid=f691f518-3b61-47e9-b5e3-5fb07e34874f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a>. That's $20 off the original list price and potentially a much better offering for anyone unsure of the game when it launched back in late August. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The deal also features Amazon's exclusive limited edition content pack, which includes Rogue Infiltrator cosmetics for Kay and Nix. It's likely the best deal we're getting on the game before Christmas, so snap it up if you've been waiting for a sale, or want to gift it to someone over the holidays.</p><div id="208147" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="8185a1a9-1142-402d-98e2-339a3b88657f"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws (PS5)</h3></p></div><div catalogid="8185a1a9-1142-402d-98e2-339a3b88657f" id="208149"><div id="208149" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws (Xbox)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This could be a good time to jump on the game since it's not been long since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-12-starts-road-to-recovery-with-improved-performance-and-large-number-of-fixes">Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment deployed a massive update</a> bringing a host of performance and gameplay enhancements, a range of visual improvements, and bug fixes to the open-world sci-fi game on console and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The publisher laid out everything new in the patch notes <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1Kq2ABlTdHgkdbGRQZ20he" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>on its website</u></a>, with Ubisoft emphasizing that these updates were shaped by player feedback, reaffirming its commitment to closely listening as post-launch support for Star Wars Outlaws continues.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What We Said In Our Review</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review">IGN reviewer Tristan Ogilvie said is his review</a>: "It’s ironic that Kay’s ship is called the Trailblazer, since there’s actually not a whole lot of ideas in Star Wars Outlaws that haven’t been done before in other action and open-world adventures. Instead, it’s quite like the Millenium Falcon: a bucket of bolts held together with repurposed parts and prone to breaking down, but at its best it’s more than capable of jolting your pleasure centres into Star Wars fan hyperspace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A clever syndicate system brings real weight to almost every task you choose to undertake, some of which have creative quest designs that can often conjure up some genuinely stunning blindsides. Having a pal like Nix at your side the entire time not only adds an extra dimension to Kay’s fairly generic smuggler character, but also gives her an enhanced set of useful abilities. But even he can’t quite make its stealth and combat feel any less rigid and repetitive, and the odds of avoiding the many glaring technical issues present at launch are 3,720 to one. But you probably didn’t want me to tell you the odds."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When Is Black Friday 2024?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual date of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024"><strong>Black Friday</strong></a><strong> in 2024 falls on November 29</strong> this year, but the deals have already kicked off. Leading up to the big event, retailers have begun to open deals online. Each day leading up to the event will slowly roll out more deals, which ultimately leads to massive discounts on Black Friday. Retailers will not reveal their biggest Black Friday deals until the big day, but most general deals will be available well in advance, such as this new discount on Star Wars Outlaws.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

"In this sense, personally, I’d like to try to make a new Dragon Engine specialized for high-spec consoles, and with it, to develop a new action-adventure game. This is just what I personally feel, so it has nothing to do with the studio’s actual plans."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ito obviously has some influence as technical director of RGG Studio but it's unclear if fans' hopes for an upgraded engine will emerge anytime soon. The Dragon Engine has so far been used to create Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, Yakuza Kiwami 2, First of the North Star: Lost Paradise, Judgement, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Lost Judgement, Like a Dragon: Ishin, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-release-date-brought-forward-a-week-to-avoid-monster-hunter-wilds-clash">the upcoming Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RGG Studio is known for its prompt releases, and this list is somehow just a fraction of its overall output as in the same time it's also released Yakuza 3, 4, and 5 Remastered, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz HD, Judgement Remastered, Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania, and Super Monkey Ball: Banana Rumble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But releasing so many games has some drawbacks, as while each Yakuza game has reviewed well, fans have complained about animations and assets that get reused over multiple entries. It's for reasons such as these that fans are eager for a new engine, not to mention the technological leap that would potentially come with leaving the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One generation behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ito added to this somewhat, saying that while RGG Studio has found ways to squeeze more life out of the Dragon Engine with each entry, it's also being held back by keeping its games on the previous console generation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We would like to avoid limiting ourselves because of performance as much as possible, but not everyone plays the Like a Dragon series on higher-end consoles, so we would like to figure out a future plan on this at some point," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This again stops short of confirming a new engine being in development at RGG Studio, and as mentioned it's already <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/majima-focused-like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-announced-at-rgg-summit-as-next-yakuza-game">revealed its next game as Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> as another Dragon Engine entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is just a spin-off, however, leaving fans with a little hope that the next mainline game, Like a Dragon 9, will perhaps make that technological jump. RGG Studio head <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-dragon-engine-unreal-engine-5-masayoshi-yokoyama">Masayoshi Yokoyama even said in 2022 that the Dragon Engine is "a bit old."</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Even those who do manage to load into the game are having problems, with players reporting missing content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://youtu.be/kuMd7udCyFM?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video message to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024’s disgruntled community</a>, Jorg Neumann, Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator, and Sebastian Wloch, Asobo CEO and co-founder, explained why the launch had gone so badly wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neumann began the video with an admission: “We knew the excitement was high for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, but frankly we completely underestimated how high and it really has overwhelmed our infrastructure.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Frankly we completely underestimated how high [excitement was] and it really has overwhelmed our infrastructure</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Wloch then proceeded to go into more detail, revealing that even simulating 200,000 concurrent players during pre-release load tests failed to prevent the launch from causing catastrophic server problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've been struggling for a few hours with one of our services,” Wloch explained. “In Flight Sim 2024, there are a few new systems in the sim. People have noticed in the career mode there's all sorts of missions, and when players at the very beginning when they start, they're asking a server for some data, and that server is going to cache it in a database. It's a pretty big database and there is a cache, and that cache is currently getting saturated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a cache that has been thoroughly tested during the whole Tech Alpha. We've done load tests simulating 200,000 users, and tonight it's just completely overwhelmed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asobo's initial attempt to fix the problems showed promise, but eventually buckled as this cache collapsed once again. “We've tried to restart the services,” Wloch said. “We've taken measures to throttle the number of people who can come in at the same time. At some point it worked pretty well, so we increased the queue speed by 5x. And it worked well for maybe half an hour or so and then all of a sudden the cache collapsed again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So we're restarting, we're trying to investigate, doing our best and going as fast as we can to make sure everybody can go in.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So why are Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 players enduring this eternal loading? And why, when players do manage to get into the game, are they seeing content they shouldn't or not displayed properly?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The issue that causes this is pretty much, when that service fails it restarts, it retries, it retries,” Wloch said. “First of all, that creates extremely long initial loading, which is not supposed to be as long. And after a certain time it will fail. If the missing data is blocking, you will not finish the loading — stop at 97% — and get a message. That means you need to restart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And if the content was not completely blocking you may enter the sim and then maybe there's a few planes missing, maybe there's some content missing, and that's all due to the same problem with that server and service.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hope is that Asobo fixes this problem as soon as possible; Wloch said that once the server issues are sorted out players shouldn’t see the queue screen they’re currently experiencing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While it’s a great launch day, we know a lot of people are frustrated,” Neumann concluded. “We're really sorry. We want to apologize. We have some problems today. The team is on it, and we will keep going.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
