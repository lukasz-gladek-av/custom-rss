It's available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via Steam and the Microsoft Store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New Game Plus does what it says on the tin: players can now start a new game on any difficulty previously cleared while carrying over weapons and Ninpo obtained on the previous run. All of these weapons and Ninpo will be reverted to Level 1, however, and as noted, players can't jump straight into a higher difficulty using New Game Plus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another quality of life upgrade arrives in the ability to hide the projectile weapon carried on the player's back. By navigating to the Options menu followed by Game Settings, players can now toggle off and on a "Show Projectile Weapon" option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for balance changes, Team Ninja has lowered the Hit Points of enemies in Chapter 8 and Chapter 11, raised the number of enemies in Chapter 13 and Chapter 14, and raised the damage dealt by "some of Ayane's attacks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A handful of bug fixes have been made too, including issues that occurred when playing on high power PCs, game breaking bugs in certain chapters, and more. The full patch notes are available below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-2-black-announced-and-its-out-now">Ninja Gaiden Black 2 was a surprise release during the January Xbox Developer Direct</a>.
