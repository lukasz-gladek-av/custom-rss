These codes are for you!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're in need of extra supplies and resources in Go Fishing, you're in the right place. Below, we've put together a list of all the active redeemable codes currently available in Roblox's popular fishing simulator, so you can get back to tracking down big catches with some useful new goodies attached to your belt.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/roblox-go-fishing-header-1741919187909.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Active Go Fishing Codes (April 2025)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Below, you'll find all of the currently active and working Go Fishing codes in April 2025 that you can redeem for free rewards:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>SPRINGTIME</strong> - 10 Luck Potion IV (<strong>NEW!</strong>)</li><li><strong>150KLIKES</strong> - 3 Giant Gifts</li><li><strong>GOFISHING </strong>- Cash</li><li><strong>ONEBAITONEFISH</strong> - Rocket Bait</li><li><strong>FREEBAITS</strong> - 10 Grape Baits</li><li><strong>50KLIKES</strong> - 5 Gold Baits</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Expired Go Fishing Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The following Go Fishing codes have expired and can no longer be redeemed as of April 2025:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>TODAYSPICKS</li><li>MERRYXMAS2024</li><li>CHRISTMAS2024</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Redeem Codes in Go Fishing</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/roblox-go-fishing-redeeming-codes-1741919187908.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To redeem Go Fishing codes, boot up the game and, once you’re in, follow the steps below:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Look at the icons on the left-hand side of the screen. In the row, you'll see one labelled "<strong>Shop</strong>" with a present icon.</li><li>Select the <strong>Shop icon </strong>to open up the storefront.</li><li>In the bottom left-hand corner of the storefront page, you'll see a code bar. Input your code here and then press <strong>claim </strong>to redeem it.</li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Isn't My Go Fishing Code Working?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If your Go Fishing code isn’t working, it’s likely due to one of two scenarios. The first is that the code was inputted incorrectly. Check the spelling and that the case is correct, then redeem again. You can even copy and paste the codes directly from this article over to Roblox if you want to make sure you’re inputting them correctly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other possibility is the code has expired or you’ve already used it. In this scenario, you should see an error message pop up below the storefront menu informing you that the code has already been redeemed or is invalid.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Get More Go Fishing Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">To check whether any new Go Fishing codes have been added, you'll want to become a member of the game's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/gofishing" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Discord server</a>. Once you're in, you can check the <strong>codes channel</strong> to see whether the devs have added any new codes to the game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Go Fishing in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to other major Roblox hits like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fisch-codes">Fisch</a>, Go Fishing drops you into a large open world ocean with a fishing rod and a simple goal. Catch fish, sell them for money, use that money to upgrade your gear and then catch rarer fish. Along the way, you'll visit a variety of unique islands, buy boats, and scrounge the depths of the ocean for the most elusive catches possible, attempting to cement yourself as the greatest fisher roaming the high seas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Callum Williams is an IGN freelancer covering features and guides.

Xbox Games Showcase 2025 will be livestreamed on Sunday, June 8, starting at 10am Pacific / 1pm Eastern / 6pm UK time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox Games Showcase 2025 will offer a look at upcoming titles from across Microsoft’s first-party studios, Microsoft said, “in addition to incredible new titles from our third-party partners across the globe.”</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what could Microsoft have up its sleeve? It has a long list of games in development, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fable-delayed-to-2026-microsoft-reveals-brand-new-pre-alpha-gameplay">the new Fable, which was recently delayed to 2026</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/perfect-dark-reboot">Perfect Dark reboot</a>, inXile’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clockwork-revolution">Clockwork Revolution</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/contraband">Contraband</a>, from the developer of the Just Cause series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-issues-update-on-rares-long-in-development-everwild">Rare's Everwild, which Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer recently checked out</a>, The Coalition's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/od-a-hideo-kojima-game">Hideo Kojima’s OD</a>, and Undead Labs' <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/state-of-decay-3">State of Decay 3</a>. Psychonauts developer Double Fine is also working on a new game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the Activision Blizzard side of things, there will of course be a new Call of Duty game later this year, and various releases from Blizzard itself. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> launches in July, so that may make the cut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Bethesda, could it finally be time to find out what’s next for Starfield? We are, after all, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-logo-pops-up-on-work-in-progress-starfield-creation-sparking-ps5-release-speculation">still waiting for that PlayStation 5 release date confirmation</a>. Could we get a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there’s always the potential for Microsoft to reveal new Xbox hardware. It is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/full-next-gen-xbox-reportedly-set-for-2027-xbox-branded-gaming-handheld-due-out-later-in-2025">reportedly set to release a next-gen Xbox console as well as an Xbox handheld at some point in 2027</a>, so this year’s showcase may be too early to find out more. But Microsoft may take the opportunity to touch on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-teased-by-asus">Xbox-branded handhelds from third-party companies</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And following in the footsteps of the 2023 Starfield Direct and 2024 Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct, this year Microsoft will follow its Xbox Games Showcase by The Outer Worlds 2 Direct. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> is from Obsidian, which is fresh from the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>. The direct “will bring you inside the walls of Obsidian Entertainment, revealing new gameplay, details, and developer insights, straight from the people making the sequel to the award-winning, first-person sci-fi RPG.” The Outer Worlds 2 is expected out later in 2025, so it seems likely we'll get a release date during the showcase.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Airtime for the Xbox Games Showcase followed by The Outer Worlds 2 Direct in local time zones:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>PDT: June 8, 10am     </li><li>EDT: June 8, 1pm     </li><li>BST: June 8, 6pm  </li><li>CET: June 8, 7pm   </li><li>JST: June 9, 2am </li><li>AEST: June 9, 3am </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft said the Xbox Games Showcase and The Outer Worlds 2 Direct will be digital-only, which means there’s no theatre experience for fans and media this year. But it promised that its livestream will bring fans “everything you’ll need to know about what’s next for Xbox, no matter where in the world you’re watching.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
