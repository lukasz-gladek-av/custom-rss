If you've been hoping to fill up your library with some new picks to play as early nights and colder weather sets in, now's your chance to score <a href="https://Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> for just $30, or <a href="https://Elden Ring" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden Ring</a> for a mere $15. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You read that right. Only $15 for a game we gave a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-review">10 out of 10</a> to and called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2022-winners">Game of the Year</a> back in 2022 is a stellar offer, and what better way to spend your holiday break than becoming Elden Lord?
