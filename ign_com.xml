            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-players-all-seem-terrified-of-the-bell-bearing-hunter-heres-why<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Ask not for whom the bell tolls.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There are many terrifying foes in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, from standard enemies all the way up to the imposing Nightlords. But one in particular seems to give many Nightfarers pause, or even cause them to turn and flee. It's the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Bell_Bearing_Hunter_Boss_Guide">Bell Bearing Hunter</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, if you've only started Elden Ring Nightreign, this could be confusing. The standard boss version of the Bell Bearing Hunter is someone you can potentially fight early on, at the conclusion of the first night while hunting the Nightlord Tricephalos. He's also a returning fight from Elden Ring proper, so you'd assume returning players would have him figured out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in Elden Ring Nightreign, bosses can spawn both at night's end and in the field, and pack more punch than they previously did in Elden Ring. And this version of Bell Bearing Hunter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1la7vlp/i_really_thought_yall_were_joking_on_bell_bearing/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seems to be doing some real damage</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have been putting in hundreds upon hundreds of runs since Elden Ring Nightreign came out, and while there's certainly been discussion over which bosses are the best or most difficult, the Bell Bearing Hunter comes up pretty often. Specifically, when he's in the castle. As one post notes, he seems <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1la7vlp/comment/mxj22h0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more powerful when he has a roof over his head</a>? Maybe he got a good night's rest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Different variants can also cause problems, and the Bell Bearing Hunter can also sometimes appear in other locations, too. The boss is already fairly intimidating, with a sword that he can swing in close range or wield, seemingly telekinetically, at long ranges. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l3z42v/what_seeing_bell_bearing_hunter_in_the_castle/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But in the castle</a>? He's got some aura.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not all hope is lost, though. One Redditor has discovered some new tech that most have probably never thought to try, that could thwart the Bell Bearing Hunter in his tracks. Or at least keep him walking in place long enough to wail on him. This user seems to have put the Bell Bearing Hunter into a permanent walk cycle by just, uh, walking at him and guarding. So taunting him into defeat, with some ranged help, might actually work?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
