As part of that, the Black Legion are available today, February 24.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the uninitiated, the Black Legion are the main antagonists of the current Warhammer 40,000 setting, in so much as their leader, Abaddon the Despoiler, is the main bad guy. They’re the poster boys of the Chaos Space Marines, the evil counterparts to the Space Marines, and have spent the last 10,000 years trying to bring down the Imperium via nefarious Black Crusades after turning traitor during the Horus Heresy.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Black Legion DLC adds 15 new units to Battlesector, including Chaos Terminators, Legionaries, Raptors, Chosen, and Havocs. As you’d expect, there are also Daemon Engines. The full list is below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector Black Legion units:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Chaos Lord</li><li>Sorcerer</li><li>Master of Executions</li><li>Legionaries</li><li>Chosen</li><li>Havocs</li><li>Raptors</li><li>Chaos Terminators</li><li>Helbrute</li><li>Forgefiend</li><li>Venomcrawler</li><li>Obliterators</li><li>Chaos Rhino</li><li>Cultist Firebrand</li><li>Chaos Cultist Mob &amp; Warband</li><li>Heldrake (HQ Command)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40k-battlesector-review">Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector is a jolly, blood-spattered tactical romp through the grim, dark future.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector Black Legion Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Already released faction DLCs include the Orks, Necrons, T’au, Demons of Khorne, Sisters of Battle, and Astra Militarum. As part of the Black Legion release, the game is now 60% off on Steam, with faction expansions discounted by up to 30%. The first feature DLC, Deeds of the Fallen, is available at a 10% discount.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot to look forward to when it comes to Warhammer 40,000 video games. We’ve got Dawn of War 4, Mechanicus 2, and Dark Heresy out this year, with both Total War: Warhammer 40,000 and Space Marine 3 in development. While we wait for those games to come out, it might be a good time to return to Battlesector.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

That’s the creation of the Kingdom Come movie," Frývaldský said (via machine translation). "We have been moving the Kingdom Come brand away from video games for some time now. So far we have been in comics, concerts, and tourism, but the film has attracted us the most. That is why Dan and I are working on getting it onto the screen or the big screen. There is also a draft script."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm sure people will wonder if this is some kind of breakup with Warhorse," he added, "No, on the contrary, Dan himself wanted to move on. He made three games that were a global success, he has been wanting to try something different for a long time. Getting Kingdom Come to the screen [...] in the next few years is another milestone that we want to achieve, and that is Dan's new role. You won't see him in the office every day anymore, but in a broader sense he is still part of Warhorse."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked for the latest on those plans to adapt Kingdom Come: Deliverance for the big screen, Frývaldský said: "For a long time, people were around us who would like to make a film of KCD, but then Covid came and everything fell asleep. Now, after the release of the second game, we have returned to the idea with much greater drive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We feel the interest from the film world, negotiations are already underway. We don't just want to sell the rights, we want the film to be what we imagine it to be."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Frývaldský suggested that Vávra's new job title could be something like transmedia director as the team pushes to expand the franchise beyond games. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best RPG of 2025</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first Kingdom Come: Deliverance video game, released in 2018, was a smash hit, selling over 10 million copies.
