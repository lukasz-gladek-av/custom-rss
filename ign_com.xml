            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But it still feels far, far away.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the wake of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-announced-from-former-kotor-and-mass-effect-director-casey-hudson-the-game-awards-2025">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic’s big announcement at The Game Awards</a>, you might have seen social media posts saying the game won't be out until 2030. Director Casey Hudson has now stepped in to address those posts, insisting the game will be out before then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is in development at Edmonton, Alberta-based developer Arcanaut Studios, which Hudson and his partners only founded in July. It stole the show at The Game Awards with a flashy, tantalising CG trailer that contained no gameplay. But fans are particularly excited because Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is billed as the spiritual successor to the much-loved Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, which Hudson directed while at BioWare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So where did all the “not till 2030” posts come from? It seems <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m7sj6bcoxk2o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a social media comment</a> from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier, in which he called a 2030 release window an “optimistic guess” based on the fact the studio was founded this year, ended up being framed elsewhere online as “Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic may not release until at least 2030.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Hudson himself has stepped in. “Don’t worry about the ‘not till 2030’ rumors,” <a href="https://x.com/CaseyDHudson/status/1999652683972489385" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudson tweeted</a>. “Game will be out before then. I’m not getting any younger!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is in “early development,” so it still feels a fair while away. But based on Hudson’s comment, it will launch at some point in 2029 <em>at the latest</em>, which is four years away. In that time, Hudson will need to build out his new studio (almost certainly a factor in announcing the game so early), which will be a huge effort all on its own, as well as build what is expected to be a high quality AAA game with huge fan expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details are thin on the ground, but we do have some top-line information as well as enthusiasm from LucasFilm Games, which is collaborating with Arcanaut Studios on the project. Obviously Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is set in the Old Republic era, given its name. It’s a “narrative-driven single-player action RPG” where you “step into the role of a Force user on a journey through a galaxy on the edge of rebirth.” We’re told players can expect an experience “where every decision deepens their journey toward light or darkness.” It sounds a lot like KOTOR, and while it may end up feeling a lot like KOTOR, Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is a completely new and different story that will introduce new characters.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Star Wars Fate of the Old Republic Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re still early in development, with many challenges ahead,” Hudson said in a blog post on <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StarWars.com</a>. “I’m grateful to have enjoyed the support of KOTOR fans for many years, and I look forward to embarking upon this journey together, sharing more of what we’re doing as soon as we can!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Hudson’s comment reassuring fans, there is some debate about whether Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic will end up missing the current generation of consoles and end up launching on the PlayStation 6 and the next Xbox, as well as PC. Time will tell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
