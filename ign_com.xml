            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-fans-are-digging-the-leaks-and-ea-hasnt-taken-them-down-yet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite requiring players to sign NDAs to prevent details of EA's upcoming untitled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/untitled-battlefield-game"><u>Battlefield</u></a> game leaking online, it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-early-battlefield-6-footage-seems-to-have-leaked-online"><u>leaked online anyway</u></a>, with dozens of video and screenshots popping up, showing off what players participating in the game's closed playtesting have been up to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we reported when the leaks surfaced, the footage seems to confirm the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella"><u>"modern" setting previously teased by Vince Zampella</u></a>, distinguishing it from other Battlefield games. A quick scroll through the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/top/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Battlefield subreddit</u></a> gives us plenty of firefights, as well as a taste of the game's destructible environments and a handful of new mechanics, including the ability to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j7y8n9/new_mechanic_clinging_to_vehicles/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>hang off vehicles</u></a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j6fw6j/what_do_you_think_of_the_mechanics_of_dragging_a/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>dragging wounded teammates out of harm's way</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most surprising of all, however, is EA is seemingly doing very little to combat the leaks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most publishers are fiercely protective of leaked early footage as pre-release gameplay can feature incomplete animations, unfinished UI, and less-than-stellar graphics. This time, however — despite the fact players are breaking confidentiality agreements by uploading videos or screenshots — EA has yet to issue takedowns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps that's because, unlike <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-ea-admits-failure"><u>Battlefield 2042's lukewarm reception</u></a>, fans seem <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j5t4bv/battlefield_6_gameplay_leaks_2_minutes_online/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pretty pleased with what they've seen so far</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I am scared to say that but this game is shaping up very damn well.

We made a game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-2">The Last of Us 2</a>, we made certain creative decisions that got us a lot of hate. A lot of people love it, but a lot of people hate that game," Druckmann said, to which Garland joked: "Who gives a shit?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Exactly," Druckmann added. "But the joke is like, you know what, let's do something that people won't care as much about — let's make a game about faith and religion."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which stars Jordan A. Mun as Tati Gabrielle, takes place in an alternate historical timeline and features a "pretty prominent religion," too, which has "changed and bastardized and evolved" over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in centuries to leave its orbit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This whole religion takes place on this one planet, and then at one point, all communication stops," Druckmann teased. "And you're playing a bounty hunter that's chasing her bounty, and she crash lands on this planet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So many of the previous games we've done, there's always, like, an ally with you," he said. "I really want you to be lost in a place that you're really confused about what happened here, who are the people here, what was their history. And in order to get off this planet — again, no one has been heard from this planet for 600 years or so — if you ever have hoped to have a chance to get off, you have to figure out what happened here."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-last-of-us-the-series">The Last of Us Season 2</a> showrunners Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-theres-a-dramatic-reason-spores-are-back-for-the-last-of-us-season-2"><u>“spores are back” following their omission from Season 1</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest trailer for the upcoming HBO show teased the introduction of spores after they were left out of Season 1. Speaking at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/vjLYIVh6Dwc?si=wl_qxgq7Zv7ZdL1P" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SXSW 2025</u></a>, Druckmann said there is "an escalation of numbers and types of infected, but also, as you see in the trailer, an escalation of the vector of how this thing spreads." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Season 1, we had this new thing that wasn’t in the game of these tendrils that spread, and that was one form," he explained. "And then one shot you see in this trailer, there are things in the air."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other The Last of Us Season 2 news, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2s-abby-kaitlyn-dever-says-its-hard-not-to-see-those-things-on-the-internet"><u>actress Kaitlyn Dever discussed playing Abby</u></a>, admitting she finds it hard to stop herself from looking at the reaction on the internet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.
