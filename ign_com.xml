Those paying $9.99 a month for the Premium Pass can collect all cards in 437 days, though the subscription would add up to almost $150 in this time.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/06/machamp-1730896591108.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The alternative art Machamp ex and the regular Machamp ex.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those not desperate to collect every alternate art card, identifiable by their artwork expanding beyond the normal borders to cover the entire card, can do so in just 130 days, or 87 with the Premium Pass. Developer Creatures Inc. will presumably release a new set of 200 to 300 cards every three or four months, so those playing every day should just about be able to complete one before another comes out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket, like many other free-to-play mobile games with microtransactions, floods players with dozens of packs on their first day as they complete simple quests and gain large amounts of experience. But this generosity soon dries up as the option to pay real money for packs is waved in front of players, and those not willing to spend can open one new pack just every 12 hours. The Premium Pass lets players open one extra pack a day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPCollector also provided some tips on how players can optimize their collecting, recommending that Wonder Picks only be used to collect 2 Star rarity cards. Pokémon TCG Pocket cards are classified by rarity, with the standard 226 ranging from 1 Diamond to 4 Diamond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 60 alternate art cards range from 1 Star to 3 Stars, followed by three super special gold background Crown cards. Regular alternate arts are 1 Star, ex Pokémon are 2 Star, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date-set-for-october">the special immersive cards with fully animated artwork</a> are 3 Star.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most efficient way to collect cards is therefore only to pick out alternate art ex Pokémon in Wonder Picks, though it's far from guaranteed one will appear in the regularly rotating spots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, players should only use Pack Points to obtain the 3 Star and Crown cards. These are the points players acquire for opening regular booster packs, obtained at the rate of five per pack. Cards at 3 Star cost 1,500 points, demanding the opening of 300 packs, and Crown cards cost 2,500 points, meaning 500 packs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will obviously take a long time to get there, but TCGPCollector is essentially recommending players play the long game and not be tempted to exchange Pack Points for cheap cards they'll come across in booster packs eventually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the last recommendation implores players not to use Poké Gold to buy packs, noting that the Premium Pass and, again, a little patience, is a much better way to spend money. Spending $9.99 on a Poké Gold bundle instead of the Premium Pass, for example, would allow players to open just nine packs compared to the 30 accrued over the course of a month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the best shop bundle, which grants 690 Poké Gold for $99.99, grants just 115 packs and therefore averages out at 87 cents per pack. This is much more than the 33 cents per pack average from the Premium Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This financial logic isn't enough to stop many, many players from buying bundles of Poké Gold, of course. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">Pokémon TCG Pocket pulled in a whopping $12 million in its first four days</a>, so the simple routine of opening packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collecting cards</a>, building decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battling others</a> is certainly enticing enough to open the purse strings of players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The digital, streamlined version of the traditional Pokémon Trading Card Game is keeping players entertained in other ways, with Creatures Inc. having already launched two events including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">one that allows players to win a Lapras ex</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players may otherwise want to keep an eye out from cards from the two decks currently dominating the Pokémon TCG Pocket meta, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">headlined by usual suspects Charizard ex and Mewtwo ex</a>.

We never confirmed it. There were some discussions of course. There was some misalignment, there was some misinformation, but at the end of the day there won’t be any Denuvo at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With that, I would like you to close the case already. Stop texting under every post we do that Denuvo is in the game, because it’s not. We never announced… we never said it will be there. As I said, a bit of a misunderstanding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That is something you should really remember, as long as Warhorse doesn’t announce anything it’s not true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Let’s bury that thing and let’s never ever talk about it any more. What we can talk about though is the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This all stems from an apparent email sent by publisher Plaion that appeared to confirm Denuvo <em>would</em> be used in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Clearly, though, that is not the case.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Denuvo is a controversial system used by video game developers and publishers to stem the tide of video game piracy by, they hope, pushing back the release of cracked versions of their games by sometimes weeks, maybe months, and in some cases, indefinitely. From a publisher perspective, Denuvo helps to prevent lost sales and revenue it might have received if those who pirate a video game at launch would have otherwise bought it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Denuvo is often criticized by PC gamers for potentially affecting video game performance and even reducing the life-span of solid-state drives (SSDs). Denuvo has repeatedly denied the claims. In 2021, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-resident-evil-village-cracked-performance-beats-official-code" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a> found the pirate version of Resident Evil Village actually improved performance. Capcom later patched the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, we’ve seen some developers even announce that their games won’t launch with Denuvo, much to the delight of PC gamers. In October, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-does-not-include-any-3rd-party-drm-including-denuvo">BioWare confirmed <u>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u> wouldn’t have third-party DRM of any kind</a>, including Denuvo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, it’s set to launch February 11, 2025. Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-the-first-preview">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 – The First Preview</a> for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

And while there are over 3,000 PlayStation 4 games to date, there’s one many of us hold dear to our hearts: Bloodborne. With a sequel now seeming little more than a pipedream, we’re left with only one option – to play through the original again on PS5 Pro to make the most of the console's Enhanced Image Quality feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But does the PS5 Pro actually make Bloodborne look any better? If you’ve pre-ordered a PS5 Pro then you can check it out for yourself, but if you’re still sitting on the fence then check out the video below and see if you can tell the difference.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve also compared some of the other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-game-enhanced-for-ps5-pro">50-plus games that are enhanced for PS5 Pro at launch</a>, starting with Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. We tested it in both Pro modes – Fidelity and Performance – and you can see the results for yourself in this 23-minute gameplay video.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hogwarts Legacy was one of the big showcase games from the console reveal. We've now had the chance to play it on PS5 Pro in Fidelity mode with ray tracing, which promises to improve lightning and shadows, as well as adding better reflections. Take a look at the game running on PS5 Pro.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally (ahem), we have 16 minutes of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth running in Versatility mode, which enhances the quality of the visuals and delivers better frame-rates.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Can you tell the difference?
