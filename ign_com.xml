Climb massive tall towers based on real buildings like the Eiffel Tower or Empire State Building. As you work your way up each one, you'll gain coins upon gliding back down to the bottom. You can then spend those coins to unlock pets and upgrade your wings to climb faster and farther.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jeffrey Lerman is a freelance game journalist for IGN who has been covering games for over a decade.
