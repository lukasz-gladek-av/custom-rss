            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/an-item-duplication-glitch-in-elden-ring-nightreign-makes-it-easier-to-share-the-wealth<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has some pretty sick gear drops. And sometimes, you might even want to let other people try out that gear, even though you want to also use them. Well, a gear duplication glitch makes it easy to share the loot, for as long as it's around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I first saw this thanks to the folks at <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-has-a-new-exploit-which-allows-you-and-your-friends-to-duplicate-weapons-and-talismans-until-youre-just-as-godly-as-the-nightlords/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>, who put together a quick guide on just how to tackle the duplication. It's actually fairly simple to execute; if two players try to pick up the same weapon, at the same time, they both pick it up. So now you have the original, and a duplicate. (Don't ask which is which, it'll freak everyone out.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only is this fairly simple, it's easy to repeat and there isn't really a downside to "failing" it. If the pick-up gets messed up, you can just try again. In fact, the only danger is that you're basically stopping in one place and coordinating this drop-and-pick-up strategy, and in Nightreign, standing still is rarely advisable. The brief respite between days, or the alabaster alcove before the big Nightlord showdown, is probably the best time to do this.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As PC Gamer noted though, they're not the first to stumble onto this trick. Various <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDUPxRrjWR0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTubers</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lbfy3z/duplicating_items/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> users have posted about the easy duplication, too. The proverbial lid is off on this particular exploit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether FromSoftware will take any aim at changing it is anyone's guess. It is somewhat niche-use. There's no voice chat or anything to coordinate with random players online, so it's not exactly feasible to start dropping your best equipment and hope everyone's on the same page.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even for teamed-up players using Discord or some other method to chat, you'd still want to have equipment that other characters would want. Not only is Elden Ring Nightreign fairly generous in drops, at least in my experience, but each character tends to have their own wants and needs for weaponry. Unless you're rolling three Ironeyes, I suppose. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The duplication glitch is nice for characters who want to double-up on specific weapons, like the Executor, but it's not some instant-win trick. For some fun and maybe sharing the wealth around if someone didn't manage to get any solid weapons by the final day, though, it might not be the worst trick to keep in your back pocket.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not everyone needs a walkthrough to get to the end, but we hope these new features and upgrades can inspire even the most seasoned Zelda player to return and discover something they may have missed or skipped on a previous playthrough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of smooth sailing, we hope you’re as excited as we are to revisit one of GameCube’s best games, The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker in its original form. Yes, that means the slow-sailing and long Triforce Chart/Shard quest found in the OG version are back – and you may want to use our guide to make sure you don’t head in the wrong direction. Our Wind Waker guide was originally written in 2002, but we’ve worked on some big upgrades to make it nice and new for Switch 2! Here’s what you can expect:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker Guide and Map</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We have overhauled our guide and walkthrough with new high-resolution screenshots, added in-page tracking, checklists, new videos, and radically upgraded our interactive map. Instead of just showing you a desktop or mobile version of the in-game map, we have redone it from the ground up and you can now zoom in all the way and see every island, enemy platform, and submarine up close. Track which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-wind-waker/Pieces_of_Heart">Pieces of Heart</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-wind-waker/Treasure_Charts">charts</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-wind-waker/Items">items</a> you’ve collected and start chasing all <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-wind-waker/Gallery_Figurines">135 Nintendo Gallery </a>images to finally get that 100% completion. If you prefer video, you can even track every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/zelda-the-wind-waker-all-treasure-chart-locations">Treasure Chart via in-video checklists</a> (or jump to the exact spot in the video from the guide). The guide and videos of course also address the Wii U HD vs GameCube/Switch 2 version differences so that it all works for both versions. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/16/windwakermap-ign-1750117025024.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">New for 2025!
