Either way, this super affordable grab bag of LEGO minis is a great way to get a handful of interesting D&amp;D-themed avatars to play with.

I like the weird, eye-catching Garden Walk set myself.</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aepYVW?object_uuid=e7995b0a-bb02-40fb-a3bb-1ca158c6f008&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><strong>Thunder of Dragons Metal Dice Set</strong></u></a> - As beautiful as they are impractical, this dragon-smothered, hollow set of dice look awesome and reviews say they perplexingly roll well to boot.

If you’re like me, you won’t be able to understand the descriptions, but the photos say it all.</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6qOZ?object_uuid=e7995b0a-bb02-40fb-a3bb-1ca158c6f008&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><strong>Olive Green Stripe Wood Dice Set</strong></u></a> - I like these dice for elves, druids, and other woodland-friendly PCs who want a wooden, green-dyed set of dice to really showcase their love of nature. Watch out for splinters!</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bWoM?object_uuid=e7995b0a-bb02-40fb-a3bb-1ca158c6f008&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><strong>Prismatic Soul Sharpedge Dice</strong></u></a> - These dice are like gazing into the depths of space – I could stare into these bad boys all day.</li></ol><p id="dds-50th-anniversary"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="D&amp;D’s 50th Anniversary">Commemorating D&amp;D’s 50th Anniversary</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">1.

Beadle &amp; Grimm’s Platinum Edition Box Sets</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Picking up one of these premium campaign sets is a delightfully self-serving option to give to your DM. These are packed with premium maps, miniatures, handouts, and props that support specific campaigns. That includes recent additions like <em>Adventures in the Multiverse</em> and <em>Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk</em>. Each set costs hundreds of dollars, but hey, you can always ask your fellow PCs to chip in.</p><div catalogid="76e35bff-0297-4ea0-a9bf-d09ec78827fe" id="210752"><div id="210752" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Beadle &amp; Grimm’s Platinum Edition Box Sets</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">2. Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Red Dragon’s Tale LEGO Set</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This 2,000+ piece LEGO set commemorates D&amp;D’s 50th anniversary (and so could very easily go on that list as well), but at more than $350, it certainly sits squarely in the high-end space. This set includes some really neat stuff, like a dragon, owlbear, beholder, and gelatinous cube, as well as some preset PCs for you to control. LEGO can be a bit pricey, but this set is still cheaper than most battlemats and painted miniatures!

Damascus Steel True Metal Dice</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This incredibly beautiful, absurdly luxury set of dice is forged from the same steel alloy found in the weapons of soldiers in a bygone age. The impressive swirl patterns and attention to detail are sure to zhuzh up any table – as they well should at a $460 asking price.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Nov 30, 2024 2:11 am</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Maybe even catching fish in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fisch-roblox">Fisch</a>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whichever “Roblox experience” has you or someone you know hooked, I’m sure it has microtransactions (things to spend real money on) in one form or another. Roblox gift cards can be converted into the Robux needed to make those purchases, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-black-friday-2024-deals">Cyber Monday</a> is one of the best times to find those gift cards on sale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are slight discounts on digital gift cards, the best savings you can possibly get is by going physical: Right now, you can get <a href="https://zdcs.link/92bnVY?object_uuid=39532ff3-ef49-4e73-ba5e-8b9fe2472693&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a full $20 off $100 Roblox gift cards</a>.

Though, I have to admit, getting $100 worth of Robux at a $20 discount is something you could even gift to yourself. A $100 gift card is equivalent to about 10,000 Robux. By saving $20, you're basically getting a whopping 2,000 Robux for free. Act fast, however, because I'm sure this Lightning Deal will sell out quick. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on what month you redeem your Roblox gift card, you’ll also get a different free virtual item. In November, that gift is the Midnight Crimson Sombrero, but if you wait until December (heads up: That's tomorrow), you’ll get the Festive Deadpan Alpaca Head.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Does Roblox Have Its Own Cyber Monday Sale? </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox as a platform doesn’t have an "official" Cyber Monday sale, but you might find deals, discounts, and special events within specific experiences.
