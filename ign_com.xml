            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-booster-bundles-back-in-stock-at-amazon-new-live-updated<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve got a stack of opened booster packs and zero regrets. That’s how I know this deal is worth flagging. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</a> is finally back at Amazon, and it’s <em>actually </em>selling at retail again; $45.02 for six packs. In 2025, finding <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-finally-solves-pokemon-tcg-shortage">Pokémon cards at their intended price</a> feels like spotting a shiny on the first encounter. It’s rare. It’s thrilling. And honestly, I want more.</p><div catalogid="742e33a5-5065-4a10-982e-245f6afb5290" id="217961"><div id="217961" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Available again directly from Amazon at the current MSRP.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle includes six booster packs from the latest Surging Sparks expansion. If you’re into Electric-types or just want an excuse to hear foil crackle between your fingers, I think this is it. The new card art looks great, there are some intriguing new Trainer strategies in the mix, and opening packs still hits the same dopamine receptors it did in 1999. 
</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">My Favorite Surging Sparks Chase Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Surging Sparks has some unreal chase cards, making a massive shift in art quallity in the Scarlet and Violet era. The Special Illustration Rare Pikachu ex is going for around $430, and Latias ex is even higher at nearly $500. Milotic ex is another banger at about $150 thanks to an ability that blocks damage from Tera Pokémon. Hydreigon ex is strong too, with a deck-discarding attack that’s super viable for play. Even the Hyper Rare Pikachu ex holds value at around $120. I don’t expect to pull any of these, but the odds keep things interesting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, this is the kind of deal that’s perfect for casual collectors like me, or anyone who enjoys the chaos of pulling something rare right after saying, “Just one more pack.” I know better than to promise a Pikachu EX SIR in every box, but I’ll absolutely take my chances when I don’t have to pay a third-party markup for the privilege.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re building a deck, feeding a binder addiction, or just gifting this to a kid so you can secretly open the packs yourself later, this is your chance. No inflated prices. No shady listings. Just six legit booster packs that actually ship from Amazon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I already added one to my cart. I’m pretending it’s “for research.” You can decide your own excuse.
