He went on to become one of the chief creatives behind the world of Half-Life 2 for Valve, where he most famously designed Half-Life 2’s iconic City 17.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later, Antonov worked on the influential Dishonored as visual design director at Arkane Studios, co-creating Dunwall. Outside of video games, Antonov was co-author on animated movies Renaissance and The Prodigies, and worked at an indie production company called Darewise Entertainment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/16/screenshot-2025-02-16-161307-1739722423908.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Viktor Antonov in Valve's Half-Life 2: 20th Anniversary Documentary.

Then I worked in advertisement, but both of those industries were very established and didn't offer me much choice for creative risk taking. As a designer, I was very lucky to find a brand new industry that could use my skills. At this time, the video game industry did not have clearly define positions and an artist could create entire worlds. So I joined the gaming industry relatively early: my first game was Redneck Rampage, a crazy funny experience in which I was able to create a big part of the art &amp; world, before moving to more "serious" projects.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Antonov based the Orwellian City 17 on his childhood city of Sofia, mixing elements from Belgrade and St. Petersburg. “I wanted to capture this specific atmosphere of Eastern and Northern Europe,” Antonov said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most recently, Antonov appeared in <a href="https://youtu.be/YCjNT9qGjh4?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve’s 20th anniversary documentary for Half-Life 2</a>, where he discussed the inspiration behind his work on the project and its visual design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://youtu.be/YCjNT9qGjh4?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Half-Life 2: 20th Anniversary Documentary</em></a><em> / Valve.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
