Until then, I didn’t think I was old, you know? I just didn’t feel my age, and I assumed I would be able to create for as long as I live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But then I became sick, and I couldn’t create anything. And I saw lots of people around me passing away at that time. I was confronted with death. Of course, I recovered, but now I was thinking, ‘Wait, how many years do I have left to make a game or a film?’ Perhaps I have 10 years?”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/16/gettyimages-2153433780-1747389158257.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kojima has been thinking about what happens once he's gone. Photo by John Phillips/Getty Images for Warner Bros. Pictures.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This reevaluation not only caused Kojima to take on a number of new projects, but to create the USB stick “kind of like a will,” which he hopes will help secure the future of Kojima Productions following his death.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I gave a USB stick with all my ideas on it to my personal assistant, kind of like a will,” he said. “Perhaps they could continue to make things after I’m gone at Kojima Productions… This is a fear for me: what happens to Kojima Productions after I’m gone? I don’t want them to just manage our existing IP.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-has-an-amazing-idea-for-a-forgetting-game-where-the-main-character-gradually-forgets-important-information-and-abilities-if-you-take-too-long-a-break-from-playing">IGN reported on Kojima’s thoughts on how time passing in real life can be used in video games</a>. Not only did Kojima comment on time-related mechanics he has implemented in past games, but he also revealed concepts that he hasn’t used yet, including an idea he scrapped from the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’ve thought about having characters’ hair grow in games,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRQeB2a-RSs&amp;t=2191s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kojima said in the most recent broadcast of his Japanese radio podcast KOJI10</a>. “Originally in Death Stranding 2, I was going to have Sam’s beard gradually grow out over time, and the player would have to shave it. If they didn’t, Sam would end up looking unkempt,” he explained. “However, as Norman Reedus is a big star, I didn’t want to make him look uncool!” Despite this, the director said it was still something he might add to another game one day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima also revealed three game concepts that have the passing of time in real life as a major mechanic. The first is a kind of game of life: “It starts out with the player being born, you’re a child and then gradually over time you become an adult. In the game, you fight various enemies. Like with the previous example (MGS3’s The End), if you keep playing the game, you will become a 70 or 80-year-old man. However, at this age you will be weaker, your eyesight will worsen. When you are a teenager you’ll be able to run faster but by the time you reach 60 you’ll slow down a bit,” Kojima explained, revealing that although your character will be in better physical condition when they are younger, they will have more knowledge and experience when they are older. This aging would affect your strategy as to how you deal with enemies. “But no-one would buy it!” Kojima added, however the other people on the podcast expressed enthusiasm about playing such a “Kojima-like game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another idea he mentioned is a game where you are creating something that takes time to mature, such as wine or cheese. This would require the player to continue gradually playing over a long period of time, and sounds like it would work as a background/idle game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, Kojima proposed a “forgetting game” that the player would have to “play through quickly.” In this concept, the main character gradually forgets important information and abilities if you take too long a break from the game. For example, if you don’t play every day, the main character will gradually forget things such as “how to fire their gun or what their job is.” This forgetfulness builds up until finally the player is unable to move. “Players would have to take a week off work or school to play it,” Kojima laughed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a hugely busy time for Kojima and his studio, Kojima Productions (now we know why!). As well as Death Stranding 2, Kojima is working on a live-action <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/death-stranding">Death Stranding film</a> with A24, the studio behind Academy Award winning films such as Everything Everywhere All At Once. He's also working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/od-a-hideo-kojima-game">OD</a> for Xbox Game Studios, and video game and movie hybrid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project">Physint</a> for Sony.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are no release dates for OD or Physint. Indeed, in January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-xbox-and-sony-games-affected-by-actors-strike">Kojima revealed the ongoing video game actors strike had affected production on both titles</a>, so it may be some time before we hear or see more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Apple case that required Apple to enable developers to offer their customers alternative ways to make purchases outside apps.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/16/tim-sweeney-1746092302375-1747385910840.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Epic's Tim Sweeney is determined to defeat Apple and Google, however long it takes. Photo by SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-sweeney-says-epic-can-afford-to-keep-spending-billions-fighting-apple-and-google-for-the-future-of-fortnite-on-mobile-for-decades-to-come"><u>IGN reported on how Sweeney had spent billions of dollars fighting Apple and Google over the way the companies run their app stores</u></a>. Sweeney told IGN at the time that he considered it a long-term investment in Epic and Fortnite’s future, insisting Epic could afford to keep up the fight for decades to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sweeney’s ongoing battle to get Fortnite back on iPhones and Android phones while avoiding paying store fees is well-documented. The gist is this: Epic doesn’t want to pay the now standard 30% store fees on revenue made on mobile games. Instead, it wants to run the likes of Fortnite through its own mobile store, the Epic Games Store, without Apple and Google getting in the way and gobbling up its profit. Back in 2020, this dispute ended up with Fortnite blocked from release on iOS.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Sweeney’s tweet it was expected that Fortnite would return to iOS, but so far… nothing. And now, Epic has issued a statement to IGN providing an update:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Apple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the U.S. App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union. Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on this statement, Fortnite is not only blocked from the U.S. App Store, but Fortnite on iOS is offline worldwide. That’s a terrible situation for Epic, which has already lost out on billions of dollars of revenue in the five years since Fortnite was booted off iPhones. Now, Tim Sweeney is tweeting at Apple boss Tim Cook to try to get him to change his mind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hi Tim. How about if you let our mutual customers access Fortnite? Just a thought.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi Tim. How about if you let our mutual customers access Fortnite? Just a thought.</p>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923133214748471391?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">After the court ruling, Apple was referred to federal prosecutors for violating the U.S. court order. "Apple’s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated," U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said. "This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Judge referred Apple and one of its executives, Alex Roman, vice president of finance, to federal prosecutors for a criminal contempt investigation into their conduct in the case. Roman gave testimony about the steps Apple took to comply with her injunction that was "replete with misdirection and outright lies," the judge wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement issued at the time, Apple said: "we strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court’s order and we will appeal." Last week, Apple asked the U.S. appeals court to pause the ruling in the Epic Games case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

The contents of these free updates will differ depending on the game.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, these upgrades are free, and are not the same as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/Nintendo_Switch_2_Edition_Games_List">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games</a>, which are premium upgrades (or, in the case of The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, free upgrades to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what can Switch 2 owners expect?

The game was due out fall 2025 but is now delayed to spring 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Bloomberg put it:</p><blockquote>PlayStation leadership didn’t give Haven staff a reason for her departure, but it came several weeks after an external test of Haven’s first game, the online shooter Fairgames, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Some developers at Haven were concerned about how the game was received and its progress, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is sticking with Haven and Fairgames for now, with new co-studio heads Marie-Eve Danis and Pierre-François Sapinski in place.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s yet more trouble for Sony’s embattled live service ambition, which now appears to be in full retreat. While Arrowhead’s Helldivers 2 was a breakout hit, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, Sony’s other live service games were either canceled or suffered disastrous launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Sony’s Concord is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history, lasting just a couple of weeks before it was brought offline amid eye-wateringly low player numbers. Sony later decided to kill the game entirely and shut its developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Concord flop came after Sony had already canceled Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us multiplayer game. And earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony reportedly canceled two unannounced live service games</u></a>, one a God of War title in development at Bluepoint, the other in the works at Days Gone developer Bend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony announced plans in February 2022 to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-by-2026">launch more than 10 live service games by March 2026</a>, later saying <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstations-10-live-service-games-will-be-from-different-genres-and-for-different-audiences">the push would bring games of different genres to different audiences</a>. It spent big on studio buyouts as part of the drive, bringing in Destiny developer Bungie, Jade Raymond's Haven Studios, and the now shuttered Firewalk Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in 2023, Sony president Hiroki Totoki said the company was reviewing the 12 live service PlayStation games it had in the works, and committed to launching only six of them by the end of financial year 2025, meaning by the end of March 2026. Totoki said Sony was still working on when the other six live service games would come out, adding: "It's not that we stick to certain titles, but for the gamers quality should be the most important.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie is still flying the live service flag, with Destiny 2 ongoing and the in-development Marathon set to launch fully later this year. Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-teamlfg-a-new-playstation-studio-spun-out-of-bungie-thats-making-a-team-based-action-game-inspired-by-fighting-games-mobas-and-frog-type-games">Sony announced a new PlayStation studio called teamLFG and teased its debut game</a>, which is a live service incubation project. Guerrilla’s Horizon multiplayer game is also in development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
