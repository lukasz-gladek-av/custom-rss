To switch up the format even more next year, Pokémon Champions will include the Mega Evolution mechanic in the official format. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Usually, players compete in fierce Pokémon battles throughout the year for a spot at the Pokémon World Championships using the most recent "core," or "mainline" Pokémon game, like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, or Pokémon Sword and Shield before that. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Champions isn't a self-contained narrative game, but rather a new, multiplayer battle-focused Pokémon game coming to both mobile and<strong> </strong>Nintendo Switch.

It will also have compatibility with Pokémon Home, allowing trainers to transfer legacy Pokémon from other games. We're unsure which Pokémon from what games will be legal to use in next year's format.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Champions features "core-style battles" with gimmicks from all eras of Pokémon, including Mega Evolution, originally from Pokémon X and Y, and Terastalization, from the recent Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. So far, we know that Mega Evolution will return in Ranked Battles in this year's official format. Mega Dragonite, recently revealed in a Pokémon Legends: Z-A Trailer, will also be coming to Pokémon Champions. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Champions is set to be released in 2026 and is being developed by Game Freak in collaboration with The Pokémon Works. Players usually begin competing for Championship Points soon after the previous year's World Championships, so we've yet to see how the release date will affect tournaments for this year's format. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a year of many firsts for the Pokemon World Championships.<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2025-pokemon-worlds-vgc-champion-kevin-han-achieves-historic-first"> VGC Champion Kevin Han made history by taking the championship title in the Junior and then Senior divisions in back-to-back years</a>, and it's the first time Championship Sunday was held in an arena.

To make this achievement even more impressive, Han took these titles back-to-back, and this year, with a completely undefeated record. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have no words to describe it. It’s an unreal feeling, I still can’t believe it,” Han said after being asked about his unprecedented achievement. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/18/screenshot-2025-08-17-at-7-15-15-pm-1755483780866.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><em>Kevin Han at the Anaheim Convention Center Arena after securing his 2025 Pokémon VGC Senior World Champion title. Image from the Play Pokémon livestream.</em></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Han, a 12-year-old from Pennsylvania, US, faced Sian Lee from South Korea in the Senior division finals. Last year, Han was defeated only twice during his climb to the Junior Championship title, and one of those defeats was at the hands of Lee, making this finals match-up especially nerve-racking. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before the match, Han’s brother, Chris Han, was asked about how Kevin Han was feeling. <br>“I can tell you one thing, he’s super nervous… but Kevin’s got this,” Chris Han said. “I don’t have any words of advice, just trust your gut Kevin–you know exactly what to do.” </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/18/screenshot-2025-08-17-at-6-40-25-pm-1755483780867.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><em>Kevin Han's 2025 VGC Pokémon team. Image from the Play Pokémon livestream.</em></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Chris Han’s faith in his brother rang true, as Kevin Han won 2-0. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think after turn one of each game, where I got my positioning up, I think I felt a lot better,” Kevin Han said. “Sometimes if you’re too nervous it can hurt you, but, in my opinion, having at least a little bit of nerves can help you a lot.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kevin Han secured his victory in the second match with a Double K.O. with his Ice Rider Calyrex’s Glacial Lance, super effective on Lee’s Rillaboom and just powerful enough to finish off the previously-damaged Zamazenta. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/18/screenshot-2025-08-17-at-6-40-50-pm-1755483780867.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><em>Sian Lee's 2025 VGC Pokémon team.

This makes Kevin Han the first-ever contender with the ability to take the World Championship title in all three divisions: Juniors, Seniors, and Masters. We’ll have to wait three years before he ages into the Masters division, where he just might make history yet again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kevin Han’s win isn’t the only historical first at this year’s Pokémon World Championships. This is also the first ever time Championship Sunday was held in a dedicated arena rather than on the stage on the convention center floor. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/18/984d56ac-e3aa-44d3-bf9c-8b8124dab31e-1755484309112.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><em>Picture of the arena stage at the 2025</em> <em>Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, CA. </em></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Casey DeFreitas is a deputy editor on the guides team at IGN and this year is the second time she's covered the Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, CA.
