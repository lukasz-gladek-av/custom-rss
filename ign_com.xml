I've also included eBay links with the products, as it's always worth seeing if one can pick up a cheeky bargain before going all in.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Japan Sealed Products</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-japan-black-bolt-and-white-flare-most-expensive">Japanese Pokémon TCG</a> booster boxes have far better odds at pulling chase cards, have far less bulk and are often half the price of English booster boxes. This also mean said chase cards are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-cards-2025">worth significantly less</a>, but Japanese cards are far easier to get perfect grades in given they're always busting out of booster packs in perfect condition. Want a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Pokémon card collection</a> on a budget? Go for Japanese cards.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">This Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pokémon TCG market is currently experiencing a split trend: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks cards</a> are undergoing a steep price correction due to increased supply, with notable drops such as Pikachu ex (247/191) falling 51% to $56, and Hydreigon ex dropping 34% to $49.60—creating a buying opportunity for collectors. Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokemon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-june-30">Crown Zenith cards are rising in value</a>, with key VSTAR Secret Rares like Giratina and Dialga seeing double-digit gains, driven by strong demand and the set’s transition into “legacy” status as the Sword and Shield era ends. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Magic: The Gathering Sealed Products</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're seeing TCG Player destory Amazon pricing on sealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-magic-the-gathering-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-june-30">Magic: The Gathering</a> product at the moment too. This is great for us, but perhaps Amazon should use their weight to look after their customers with predatory over MRSP pricing? Atleast with TCG Player you're getting market value, with some product scating very close to the recommended retail price.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Preorder MTG: Marvel's Spider-Man</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard work trying to get a preorder in for anything <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deals-for-today-mtg-marvels-spider-man-preorders-live-on-tcgplayer">MTG Spider-Man</a> related at big box stores outside of a Play Booster Box, but TCG Player have the stock, and in most cases, the cheapest pricing for preorders. There's every chance Amazon will get more stock allocation before release, but if you don't want to miss out on launch, I'd highly reccomend securing preorders with a reputable seller on TCG Player. If this set is anything like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-most-expensive-surge-foils">MTG: Final Fantasy</a>, launch day stock is going to be none existent.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Preorder MTG: Edge Of Eternities</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-preorder-guide">MTG: Edge of Eternities preorders</a> are the exception to the rule in this weeks MTG deals round-up. Amazon comes in cheaper on most preorders, with TCG Player taking the cheapest spot on the Play Booster Box and Commander Deck bundles. I've included eBay links too, which is always a wise choice to check for cheap preorders before putting your money on the table.</p><p id="the-witcher-boxed-set"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Witcher Boxed Set">The Witcher Boxed Set</h2></p><div catalogid="bf8a3933-8059-4393-a17e-7ebed8390fe4" id="224165"><div id="224165" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Witcher Boxed Set</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>includes: Blood of Elves, The Time of Contempt, Baptism of Fire, The Tower of Swallows and The Lady of the Lake</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-books-reading-order">This is the core of Sapkowski’s epi</a>c—<em>Blood of Elves</em>, <em>The Time of Contempt</em>, <em>Baptism of Fire</em>, <em>The Tower of Swallows</em>, and <em>Lady of the Lake</em>—finally bundled in one set.
