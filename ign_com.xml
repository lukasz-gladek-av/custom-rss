            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Seven legendary ornaments from across the franchise timeline.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Halloween may be right around the corner, but the winter holiday season will come at us just as fast. If you're a big Zelda fan or have special someone in your life that is obsessed, Hallmark has a handful of awesome ornaments spanning the franchise's storied history you can buy right now. Ranging in price from $12 to $32, purchasing one of these won't break the bank and will last for holidays to come. If you're looking for an affordable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-legend-of-zelda-gift-ideas">Legend of Zelda gift</a> to buy ahead of the 2025 Christmas season, this is a delightful option worth considering.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Legend of Zelda Hallmark Ornaments</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pretty much every era from Zelda's history is represented with these ornaments, from the NES original 8-bit Link to 2023's Tears of the Kingdom <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-hallmark-christmas-ornament-amazon-buy-2025">Decayed Master Sword</a>. The Link with his sword and shield ornament is another notable inclusion, since it plays classic Zelda tunes at the push of a button. I personally would have appreciated some Twilight Princess love with this collection, but I can't complain with what's on offer here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each ornament is only a few inches in every dimension, so storing them efficiently in the off-season or utilizing them as year-round decor is definitely on the table. I have a game shelf that the Toon Link ornament would be right at home on. The 8-bit Link ornament is low on stock, so if you've had your eye on it, now's the perfect time to pick one up.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Hallmark Nintendo Ornaments</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, The Legend of Zelda franchise isn't the only <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hallmark-keepsake-ornaments-nitendo-where-to-buy">Nintendo property receiving the Hallmark treatment</a>. There's an Elephant Mario from Super Mario Bros. Wonder would look great on any Christmas tree, and the winter hat Rowlet is one of the cutest things I've ever seen.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Is Hallmark a Good Ornament Brand?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Hallmark isn't the only ornament brand out there, but it is certainly one of the most well-known. The main appeal of Hallmark Keepsake ornaments is that the brand offers yearly releases from popular IPs like Nintendo, Star Wars, Disney, and more. If you're looking for a little piece of your favorite movie or video game to hang on your tree, it's most likely going to be a Hallmark-branded ornament. Seeing as the ornaments are officially-licensed, they are also likely to be of higher quality than any knock-off brands you find elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.
