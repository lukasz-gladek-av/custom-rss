It's no secret that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-smart-watches">best smartwatch</a> for iPhone is Apple Watch Series 10, and you can always stay in the iOS ecosystem with Apple’s other official accessories.

Although it’s less prone to shattering if dropped these days, we still recommend wrapping your phone in a lightweight, yet durable case – like the Smartish Slim Case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Made from tough hard plastic and rubber, this case features cushioned corners that absorb and disperse impact away from the phone itself to prevent cracking if dropped. It’s also designed with raised bumpers, so the display won’t sit flush with a flat surface when facedown. Meanwhile, the Smartish Slim Case is made with MagSafe built-in for wireless charging and other accessories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It comes in nine colors and styles, including black, blue, transparent, purple, and more.

Delivering a total of 150W of power, it’s an absolute workhorse so it’ll have no trouble juicing up a power-hungry iPad or MacBook and your iPhone at the same time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with two or three devices plugged into this wall charger, an iPhone should still hit max charging speeds when connected to the charger’s USB-C port. That’s thanks to its dynamic power distribution. Considering the average charging block taps out at 20W, charging will be measurably faster. Anker also includes technology to measure temperature, keeping things safe as you juice up quickly. </p></div><p id="best-car-mount"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best car mount" id="iottievelox">4. iOttie Velox Magnetic Dash Mount</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Car Mount for iPhone</h3><div catalogid="d08edf02-e857-4fa6-ba06-f12f43deb77d" id="213256"><div id="213256" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>iOttie Velox Magnetic Dash Mount</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Compatible with MagSafe phone cases, this wireless charger is a must-have if you travel regularly in your car and want to keep your phone’s battery topped up.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Compatible Apple iPhone</p><p>iPhone 8 or newer</p></div><div><p>Material</p><p>Soft plastic and silicone</p></div></div><div><div><div><p>Strong magnets hold device in place</p></div><div><p>Has wireless charging functionality</p></div></div><div><p>Only compatible with MagSafe cases</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s illegal to use your iPhone while driving – distracted driving is one of the biggest causes for accidents. Go hands-free and mount it on your car’s dashboard or windshield. The iOttie Velox Magnetic Dash Mount attaches to your car with a strong suction cup, while its powerful magnets keep your device in place to use in either landscape or portrait modes. It’s a wireless charger too, so your device will get some juice via your vehicle’s cigarette lighter. </p></div><p id="best-screen-protector"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best screen protector" id="ferilinso">5.

Since Apple invented MagSafe for a stronger, more reliable connection between a wireless charger to an iPhone 12 or later, the company's latest generation of MagSafe Charger is the best, most effective option for the iPhone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The MagSafe Charger features a sleek, slim hockey-puck design with a strong magnet that aligns with the back of the iPhone for charging. The powerful connection between the two devices means there shouldn’t be any problem when picking up the phone to answer calls or checking socials while charging. The durable, high-quality materials used in its build mean the charger can handle some wear and tear too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike other wireless chargers, which are often limited to 7.5W speeds when charging an iPhone, the Apple MagSafe Charger can reach up to 25W with a 30W or 35W USB-C power adapter. Unfortunately, that wall charger will need to be purchased separately. Still, this option offers excellent value, as it features Qi2 and Qi support – any device that has Qi charging can juice up wirelessly. </p></div><p id="best-battery-pack"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best battery pack" id="magsafebatterypack">7. Anker MagGo Power Bank</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Battery Pack for iPhone</h3><div catalogid="d08edf02-e857-4fa6-ba06-f12f43deb77d" id="213261"><div id="213261" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker MagGo Power Bank</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Align this Qi2-certified, MagSafe compatible battery pack perfectly to your iPhone and charge wirelessly on the go. </p></div></div><div><div><p>Compatible Apple iPhone</p><p>iPhone 12 or newer (for MagSafe)</p></div><div><p>Material</p><p>Aluminum and soft plastic</p></div></div><div><div><p>MagSafe compatible for secure connection to iPhone</p></div><div><p>Includes a tiny smart display</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Need to charge up your device on the go? Skip the hassle of cable management by grabbing the Anker MagGo Power Bank instead. Similar to the Apple MagSafe Charger, this battery pack is MagSafe-compatible for a secure, stable connection to the back of your phone. Just be prepared for it to add some bulk to your device. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a 10,000mAh capacity, the Anker MagGo Power Bank can juice up your iPhone about 1.5 times before needing to be recharged itself. Thanks to the MagSafe compatibility, iPhone charging speeds hit up to 15W. If faster charging is necessary, the battery pack can also connect to an iPhone via USB-C instead, delivering up to a 27W output.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what makes the MagGo Power Bank even more of a standout is the tiny smart display on its side. The TFT screen provides handy info on battery levels and charging times, and a little kickstand holds up your phone for easy viewing when charging. Not to mention the fun color options this battery pack comes in.  </p></div><p id="best-charging-cable"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best charging cable" id="ankerusbc">8.

It also comes in three colors, including black, red, and silver.</p></div><p id="best-power-bank"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best power bank" id="belkin">9.

With it comes a 10,000mAh battery for an over a full extra charge to your phone. But what makes this power bank a real standout is the inclusion of built-in, durable USB-C and Lightning cables that tuck away neatly when not in use. It’s perfect for those constantly losing and tangling wires. Beyond those cables, an additional USB-C port is provided to juice up a third device. However, to enjoy up to 30W charging speeds from the USB-C or 20W from the Lightning cable, only one device can be charged at a time. That’s plenty of power for an iPhone or iPad. Just don’t expect to charge a MacBook. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the Mophie Powerstation Plus will be spending lots of time getting tossed in bags and pockets to take on the go, the solid aluminum frame and compact build are ideal. Four tiny indicator lights on the side of the power bank also let you know when it’s time for the battery itself to get juiced up. </p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Razer Kishi Ultra – Photos</h3></div></output></p></div><p id="best-controller"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best controller" id="backboneone">10.

Still, Apple has made some headway with the A18 chips found in the iPhone 16 models, especially the extra graphics core living in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/iphone-16-pro-max-review"><u>iPhone 16 Pro Max</u></a>. That’s coupled with higher-tier games coming to iOS like Assassin’s Creed Mirage and Resident Evil. But to really amp up that iPhone gaming experience an extra notch, grabbing the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-phone-controller"><u>best phone controller</u></a> is the way to go</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/razer-kishi-ultra-mobile-gaming-controller-review"><u>We reviewed the Razer Kishi Ultra</u></a> and absolutely loved this phone controller. It connects directly to iPhone 16 and 15 models via USB-C for zero latency when you play, while the controller stretches, flanking the screen for a comfortable grip. On it comes full-size analog sticks, an 8-way D-pad, and hall-effect triggers. But the star of the show is the ultra-responsive and clicky Mecha-Tactile buttons. L4 and R4 buttons are also ready for some macro inputs. It's a major upgrade from just tapping away at the screen, and you can even use this controller away from your phone by connecting to a PC or iPad via USB-C. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Razer Nexus app makes it simple to tinker with the different buttons and controls. You can remap buttons, adjust dead zones, swap RGB lighting, and more. Unfortunately, using the Kishi Ultra with iOS is slightly more limited than with Android, so Sensa HD Haptics and Virtual Controller Mode aren’t available. Still, Razer makes it simple to access Apple Arcade, Steam Link, Xbox Game Pass, and PlayStation Remote Play, so you can get gaming quickly on your iPhone. </p></div><p id="best-portable-bluetooth-speaker"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best portable Bluetooth speaker" id="bosesoundflex">11.

Whether you’re streaming podcasts or music, the soundstage is wide with crisp, rich audio despite this speaker's compact design. And when we say “compact,” we mean it. It weighs less than half a pound and measures just 3.6x2.7x1.6 inches, making it easy to toss in a bag or even throw in a pocket. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adding more reasons why the JBL Go 3 earns the title as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-bluetooth-speakers">best Bluetooth speaker</a> for portability is its IP67 rating. It’s both waterproof and dustproof, so a little dirt and rain won’t stop the music whether you're at the beach, by the pool, on a picnic, or around the campfire. The only real downside is the slightly limiting five-hour battery life. </p></div><p id="best-cleaning-kit"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best cleaning kit" id="ecasp">12.

Earlier models of the iPhone, such as the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111864" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone X</a>, came with wired Apple earbuds, a Lightning to 3.55mm headphone jack adapter, and a power adapter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, as part of Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new environmental goals</a>, more recent iPhone models only come with the USB-C charging cable (iPhone 15 and later), with an included recommendation that purchasers “re-use your current USB-A to lightning cables, power adapters, and headphones.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Can I use any USB-C charger for my iPhone? </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The occasional rumor will circulate that it’s bad form to use non-Apple chargers on your iPhone. This is generally not true, as any compabitle cable will work to power your phone, but there are some stipulations to pay attention to. If you want to guarantee you get the highest quality of charging power (and not bunk cords that damage your device's battery), check whether a charger is "<a href="https://mfi.apple.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MFi-certified</a>," meaning it was made for iPhone and certified by Apple. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">What gaming accessories are good for iPhones?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As big studios continue to release mobile versions of their most popular games, you may be wondering what you can do to optimize your iPhone gaming experience. While the Razer Kishi Ultra is our pick for the best gaming accessory, other options are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/iPhone-Game-Accessories/s?k=iPhone+Game+Accessories" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the market</a>, including iPhone-compatible <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/accessories/all/gaming?fh=4684%2B4a77%2B45ef" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wireless gaming controllers</a>.

While the best part of any new showcase is new game announcements, release dates, and trailers, we know some announcements are bigger than others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s why we’re giving you a chance to rank your favorite announcements from the recent PlayStation State of Play. Was it the first look at Saros? Or the new game from the lead designer of Grand Theft Auto? With over 20 announcements from yesterday’s showcase, look back at our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced">Everything Announced post</a> and decide which big reveal made the most impact on you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for me, the Metal Gear Solid Delta release date was probably my most anticipated announcement, but it was also really cool to finally get a look at the main character of Capcom’s upcoming Onimusha: Way of the Sword. And what’s more, it’s incredible that he’ll be modeled after one of my favorite actors, Toshiro Mifune.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So let us know how the State of Play news items ranked for you below.</p><div id="playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-announcements-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">PlayStation State of Play February 2025 Announcements Tier List</h3><h3>PlayStation State of Play February 2025 Announcements Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
