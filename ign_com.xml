It’s a success for the Ukrainian studio, a miracle, really, considering the harrowing circumstances that followed Russian’s full-scale invasion of the country in 2022. But Stalker 2 suffers from well-documented bugs and issues; chief among them A-Life 2.0.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A-Life was a key feature of the first STALKER game that governed AI behavior across the game world. At a high level, it is a system for simulating life in the Zone that works its magic seemingly independently of the player’s actions or whereabouts. It helps to create convincing AI and the emergent gameplay STALKER is famous for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GSC had said A-Life 2.0 would make the Zone feel alive as never before, that it would fuel emergent gameplay on a scale previously thought impossible. Indeed for some fans, A-Life 2.0 was STALKER 2’s biggest selling point. But when STALKER 2 actually came out players discovered that A-Life 2.0 didn’t work properly, with some questioning whether it was even in the game at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam"><u>GSC explained what went wrong with STALKER 2’s A-Life 2.0</u></a>, and vowed to fix the system. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-patch-11-is-a-big-one-adds-first-iteration-of-a-life-fixes">Patch 1.1</a>, released in December, was the first step on that road.

Delivering a total of 150W of power, it’s an absolute workhorse so it’ll have no trouble juicing up a power-hungry iPad or MacBook and your iPhone at the same time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with two or three devices plugged into this wall charger, an iPhone should still hit max charging speeds when connected to the charger’s USB-C port. That’s thanks to its dynamic power distribution. Considering the average charging block taps out at 20W, charging will be measurably faster. Anker also includes technology to measure temperature, keeping things safe as you juice up quickly. </p></div><p id="best-car-mount"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best car mount" id="iottievelox">4. iOttie Velox Magnetic Dash Mount</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Car Mount for iPhone</h3><div catalogid="d08edf02-e857-4fa6-ba06-f12f43deb77d" id="213256"><div id="213256" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>iOttie Velox Magnetic Dash Mount</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Compatible with MagSafe phone cases, this wireless charger is a must-have if you travel regularly in your car and want to keep your phone’s battery topped up.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Compatible Apple iPhone</p><p>iPhone 8 or newer</p></div><div><p>Material</p><p>Soft plastic and silicone</p></div></div><div><div><div><p>Strong magnets hold device in place</p></div><div><p>Has wireless charging functionality</p></div></div><div><p>Only compatible with MagSafe cases</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s illegal to use your iPhone while driving – distracted driving is one of the biggest causes for accidents.

Since Apple invented MagSafe for a stronger, more reliable connection between a wireless charger to an iPhone 12 or later, the company's latest generation of MagSafe Charger is the best, most effective option for the iPhone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The MagSafe Charger features a sleek, slim hockey-puck design with a strong magnet that aligns with the back of the iPhone for charging. The powerful connection between the two devices means there shouldn’t be any problem when picking up the phone to answer calls or checking socials while charging. The durable, high-quality materials used in its build mean the charger can handle some wear and tear too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike other wireless chargers, which are often limited to 7.5W speeds when charging an iPhone, the Apple MagSafe Charger can reach up to 25W with a 30W or 35W USB-C power adapter. Unfortunately, that wall charger will need to be purchased separately. Still, this option offers excellent value, as it features Qi2 and Qi support – any device that has Qi charging can juice up wirelessly. </p></div><p id="best-battery-pack"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best battery pack" id="magsafebatterypack">7.

Skip the hassle of cable management by grabbing the Anker MagGo Power Bank instead. Similar to the Apple MagSafe Charger, this battery pack is MagSafe-compatible for a secure, stable connection to the back of your phone. Just be prepared for it to add some bulk to your device. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a 10,000mAh capacity, the Anker MagGo Power Bank can juice up your iPhone about 1.5 times before needing to be recharged itself. Thanks to the MagSafe compatibility, iPhone charging speeds hit up to 15W. If faster charging is necessary, the battery pack can also connect to an iPhone via USB-C instead, delivering up to a 27W output.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what makes the MagGo Power Bank even more of a standout is the tiny smart display on its side. The TFT screen provides handy info on battery levels and charging times, and a little kickstand holds up your phone for easy viewing when charging. Not to mention the fun color options this battery pack comes in.  </p></div><p id="best-charging-cable"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best charging cable" id="ankerusbc">8.

For a cable-powered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-portable-charger"><u>portable charger</u></a>, the Mophie Powerstation Plus, remedies this problem. With it comes a 10,000mAh battery for an over a full extra charge to your phone. But what makes this power bank a real standout is the inclusion of built-in, durable USB-C and Lightning cables that tuck away neatly when not in use. It’s perfect for those constantly losing and tangling wires. Beyond those cables, an additional USB-C port is provided to juice up a third device. However, to enjoy up to 30W charging speeds from the USB-C or 20W from the Lightning cable, only one device can be charged at a time. That’s plenty of power for an iPhone or iPad. Just don’t expect to charge a MacBook. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the Mophie Powerstation Plus will be spending lots of time getting tossed in bags and pockets to take on the go, the solid aluminum frame and compact build are ideal. Four tiny indicator lights on the side of the power bank also let you know when it’s time for the battery itself to get juiced up. </p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Razer Kishi Ultra – Photos</h3></div></output></p></div><p id="best-controller"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best controller" id="backboneone">10.

It connects directly to iPhone 16 and 15 models via USB-C for zero latency when you play, while the controller stretches, flanking the screen for a comfortable grip. On it comes full-size analog sticks, an 8-way D-pad, and hall-effect triggers. But the star of the show is the ultra-responsive and clicky Mecha-Tactile buttons. L4 and R4 buttons are also ready for some macro inputs. It's a major upgrade from just tapping away at the screen, and you can even use this controller away from your phone by connecting to a PC or iPad via USB-C. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Razer Nexus app makes it simple to tinker with the different buttons and controls. You can remap buttons, adjust dead zones, swap RGB lighting, and more. Unfortunately, using the Kishi Ultra with iOS is slightly more limited than with Android, so Sensa HD Haptics and Virtual Controller Mode aren’t available. Still, Razer makes it simple to access Apple Arcade, Steam Link, Xbox Game Pass, and PlayStation Remote Play, so you can get gaming quickly on your iPhone. </p></div><p id="best-portable-bluetooth-speaker"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best portable Bluetooth speaker" id="bosesoundflex">11.
