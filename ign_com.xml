            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The director of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33"><u>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</u></a> always believed the turned-based RPG was going to be "cool," but had no idea it would get this "big."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RadioTimesGaming" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Radio Times Gaming</u></a> following this year's Golden Joysticks awards, creative director Guillaume Broche spoke candidly about the studio's work, admitting that the game's reception from fans and critics alike has been so unexpected, saying "nobody really understands what's happening."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think people don't really realize that, now it's become big, but before the launch, it was not supposed to be big," Broche said. "I think we all felt the same thing. It's going to be cool. It's not going to be big, it's going to be cool. And what's happening today is like, as we say, nobody really understands what's happening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a weird feeling, when you put your heart out into the world and the world embraces it and gives you so much love back. We get so much love from the players... it's so touching and incredible that it's very hard to explain."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ben Starr — who voices Verso in the RPG — feels the same, adding: "It was never intended to be as big as it is. It's turned into this kind of cultural moment, phenomenon, but that's just because the game is very honest, I think. And a lot of people have bought into that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think anyone expected this because it's a small game. No one expected those numbers, and we've all just been messaging each other thinking, this is, well, this is just silly. This is just silly now. Everyone just stop. It's a silly joke. But yeah, it's been very cool."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 launched on April 24 across PC and console, but also straight into Xbox Game Pass as a day-one title. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review"><u>IGN's 9/10 review of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</u></a>, we described it as a "modern RPG classic," adding: "In so many ways, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 reminded me of numerous classic and contemporary RPGs I love, but developer Sandfall truly understood why those games are special and made the pieces it borrowed its own."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has sold <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1975924077496852782" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>5 million copies in five months</u></a>, making it one of the biggest hits of the year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A wave of speculation among fans of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control">Control</a> developer Remedy Entertainment has been sparked by the filing of a fresh trademark, just days ahead of The Game Awards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-trademark-control-resonant-unearthed-ahead-tga" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MP1st</a>, a trademark for something named "Control: Resonant" was filed yesterday, November 27, by Remedy's legal firm, Nordic Attorneys at Law Ltd. This, it's stated, is the same group responsible for all of Remedy's other trademarks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The obvious conclusion here is that Control: Resonant will be the title of Remedy's upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control-2">Control sequel</a>, which the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-announces-control-2-for-playstation-5-xbox-series-and-pc">developer first announced for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S back in 2022</a>. Little else is known about the project, however. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The timing of the trademark's filing raises eyebrows, coming exactly two weeks before this year's The Game Awards broadcast on December 11. And Remedy has gone big at the show before, with a full dance number during the show's 2023 ceremony to celebrate Alan Wake 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, there's a possibility this isn't the Control sequel that fans are waiting patiently for. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-movies-on-the-way-thanks-to-new-annapurna-partnership">Remedy also has ideas for film and TV adaptations cooking</a> in collaboration with Annapurna Interactive, or this could alternatively be some other kind of spin-off. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the sense among fans is that now is the right time for Control's full sequel to be revealed, two years after Remedy's last blockbuster game project arrived, and as a statement of intent following the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-admits-fbc-firebreak-underperformed-commercially-we-were-unsatisfied">disappointing performance of FBC: Firebreak</a>, the studio's scrappy attempt at a Control multiplayer experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Remedy for more, and will of course be reporting all the announcements from The Game Awards 2025 live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.
