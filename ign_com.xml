            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has chalked up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws"><u>Star Wars Outlaws</u></a>' lackluster performance to the "choppy waters" of the sci-fi saga's fandom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Addressing shareholders at a recent <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/zzxygofu/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Q&amp;A</u></a>, Guillemot didn't reflect on the game's own performance issues, bugs, or complaints about repetitive gameplay, instead saying: "Outlaws was released at a time when the brand that it belonged to was in a bit of choppy waters." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I's true that the Star Wars brand has taken a bit of a battering of late, with a middling reception to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and lower-than-hoped viewership of various Disney+ spin-offs like Book of Boba Fett and The Acolyte. But attributing Outlaws' mixed reception to broader issues with the fandom has raised a few eyebrows among fans for feeling slightly reductive.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Guillemot did not make note of the game's own technical problems on arrival, for example. IGN's own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review"><u>Star Wars Outlaws review</u></a> — in which we awarded the sci-fi game a "Good" 7/10 — highlighted repetitive combat and "a few too many bugs at launch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, the game was mired in controversy when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-our-goal-is-not-to-push-any-specific-agenda"><u>Ubisoft was accused of "pushing an agenda," resulting in "polarized comments"</u></a> around the developer/publisher and the game long before the game released. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-a-pirates-fortune-is-a-love-letter-to-hondo-ohnaka"><u>Star Wars Outlaws got its first story expansion in May</u></a> with the release of the A Pirate’s Fortune DLC on PlayStation, Xbox and PC. A Pirate's Fortune gives players the chance to join forces with Hondo Ohnaka, head of the Ohnaka Gang. Hondo will be a name familiar to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-the-clone-wars"><u>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</u></a> fans and readers of the 2017 comic book series Star Wars: Darth Maul, and has even done time as one of the animatronic characters at the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge attraction. This time around he'll be Kay's ally as she takes on Stinger Tash and her gang, the Rokana Raiders, checks out a mysterious tomb and does some smuggling for the Miyuki Trade League.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2">Star Wars Outlaws is getting a Nintendo Switch 2 release on September 4</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Chinese Room, the acclaimed British indie studio behind last year's oil rig horror game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a>, has now officially cut ties with its former parent company Sumo Digital. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio, which also developed indie darlings Dear Esther and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, has now completed a management buyout, a spokesperson for The Chinese Room has confirmed to IGN. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's news follows an uncertain few months for the Brighton-based studio, after Sumo's previous <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2025/sumo-group-update/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announcement</a> it would be refocusing its efforts "exclusively on development services for partners", rather than continuing its work on original franchises.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a message to press today, The Chinese Room said it had looked "increasingly likely" the company would be sold off by Sumo Digital, likely to a private equity firm or another overseas buyer — Sumo itself having been acquired by Chinese giant Tencent in 2018.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, The Chinese Room will now be run as an indepedent entity headed up by studio director Ed Daly, following a deal facilitated by venture capital firm Hiro Capital. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property, but also to partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with our vision," Daly said. "This is what we are doing and we want to carry on doing it, so we're happy to carry on in this vein."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the launch of Still Wakes the Deep and last month's DLC pack Siren's Rest, The Chinese Room now has two new IPs in the works, it was revealed today. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next to launch, however, will be the long-gestating Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, set to be published by Paradox Interactive this coming October.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Chinese Room is a huge British success story that has rightly been recognised as a unique creative force capable of competing on the world stage," said Spike Laurie, a partner at Hiro Capital.  "From hiring British people to making games set in the UK, they've been one of our foremost creative studios and now they are once again in charge of their own destiny while remaining British.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are at risk of overlooking these creative gems and letting them be sold to overseas corporations," Laurie continued. "That is a travesty for the $5.5 billion British gaming industry which has a world-renowned reputation. We need to nurture this talent and support it through difficult times, because it is one of our leading creative exports."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

It's been decades since Donkey Kong's last 3D outing, and this might just be DK's best game yet. There are hundreds of different bananas to find across each layer of the planet, and the new Bananza mechanics are a joy to experiment with. In my opinion, Bananza is worthy of picking up a Nintendo Switch 2 — it's that good.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Persona 3 Reload for $20</h2></div><div catalogid="32d78f5f-cb50-4f43-84a1-aaecdcc68343" id="225512"><div id="225512" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Persona 3 Reload (PS5)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona 3 Reload is available at Walmart for just $20. This was one of the most anticipated RPGs of 2024, and for the most part, it delivered. The mystery of the Dark Hour is compelling, and Persona 3's cast of characters shine bright in a story that has quite a few twists and turns. The Episode Aigis DLC features epilogue content that was originally depicted in The Answer, so you can experience everything Persona 3 has to offer with Reload.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition for $47.99</h2></div><div catalogid="32d78f5f-cb50-4f43-84a1-aaecdcc68343" id="225506"><div id="225506" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition launched earlier this year, and it's still one of the biggest RPGs you can jump into on any platform. The remaster introduced numerous quality-of-life updates that were much needed, in addition to a brand-new epilogue chapter. We gave the game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review">a 9/10 in our review</a>, stating, "Xenoblade Chronicles X was already one of the Wii U’s best games, and this Definitive Edition does more than enough to justify another trip to planet Mira."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Donkey Kong Switch Games Are on Sale at Woot</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> out now, there has never been a better time to jump in and experience the Nintendo Switch library of Donkey Kong games. Woot has each of these games on sale this weekend, with the absolutely stellar Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze and Donkey Kong Country Returns HD included.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake for $34.99</h2></div><div catalogid="f5eb8ae2-57bf-4d14-8f8d-fb017cf92af0" id="225203"><div id="225203" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> was one of the most enjoyable RPGs of 2024, featuring a gorgeous remade HD-2D world and voice acting. If you haven't had the chance to check this one out yet, Amazon has Nintendo Switch copies available for only $34.99. In my opinion, the Switch has to be the definitive way to experience this classic, and now is the perfect time to catch up before Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake this Fall.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Apple AirPods 4 for $89.99</h2></div><div catalogid="32d78f5f-cb50-4f43-84a1-aaecdcc68343" id="225514"><div id="225514" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods 4 Wireless Earbuds</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Apple AirPods 4 are 30% off at Amazon right now, making this weekend a great time to pick up a pair if you've been meaning to. AirPods 4 brought a redesign closer to the AirPods Pro, with up to 30 hours of total listening time using the charging case. The H2 chip packs in better sound and call quality than the AirPods 3, so you can expect a great listening experience at all times.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Request A Nintendo Switch 2 Invitation on Amazon</h2></div><div id="224535" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="43f764a1-8692-437c-8614-00fd94472924"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Amazon has already begun sending out invites to buy.</p></div></div><div catalogid="43f764a1-8692-437c-8614-00fd94472924" id="224536"><div id="224536" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Amazon has already begun sending out invites to buy.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has at last listed the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and you can request an invite to purchase the console now. Once you are selected, you will receive an email that will allow you to add the system to your cart and purchase it. There is no telling when these invites will run out, so I recommend requesting one, even if you might purchase the Switch 2 elsewhere.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bose Ultra Open-Ear Wireless Earbuds for $199</h2></div><div catalogid="32d78f5f-cb50-4f43-84a1-aaecdcc68343" id="225508"><div id="225508" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bose - Ultra Open-Ear True Wireless Open Earbuds - White Smoke</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Best Buy has the Bose Ultra Open Ear Wireless Earbuds for $199 this weekend.
