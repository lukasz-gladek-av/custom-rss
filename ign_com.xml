The Ghost of Tsushima sequel did show up for a brief appearance during the tail end of the presentation but mostly served simply as a reminder that Sucker Punch is still hard at work to meet its October release date.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While it may have been disappointing to see Ghost of Yōtei come and go so quickly, it sounds like the July State of Play gameplay deep dive will do more to help with the wait. Sucker Punch’s showcase doesn’t have a release date yet but is said to focus entirely on Ghost of Yōtei and its “evolved gameplay mechanics, including exploration, combat, and much more.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sucker Punch formally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-2-confirmed-as-ghost-of-yotei-at-state-of-play-releasing-2025">announced</a> its Ghost of Tsushima sequel last September, promising to place players in the shoes of new protagonist Atsu as she embarks on a bloody journey through Japan in 1603. Although the wait for story and gameplay details has been painful for those hoping for a sequel since the original game launched in 2020, director Nate Fox has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-director-vows-to-deliver-a-respectful-representation-of-japan-on-par-with-ghost-of-tsushima">said the experience will be "a respectful representation" of Japan</a>, just like its predecessor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ghost of Yōtei has a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-confirms-ghost-of-ytei-ps5-release-date-with-new-trailer"><u>release date</u></a> of October 2, 2025 for PS5.

We later see Bond as a young recruit in the Royal Navy, from which he is recruited by MI6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's here that players pick up Bond's story as he becomes an agent, picks up an Omega watch, and starts annoying Q by trying out his gadgets in the lab. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A press release issued alongside the game's State of Play appearance lists Bond's age in 007 First Light as "a young 26-year-old". Players will be traverse the globe in what is described as "a story-driven action-adventure game" where you can choose how to navigate various challenges — either with brute force or 007's trademark charm.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">007 First Light screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What looks like gameplay footage shows James Bond on a mission, stealthing around, using gadgets — and his fists — to subdue enemies, as the hero is sent off to target a rogue agent. "009 is a master manipulator," Greenway says at one point. "Whatever the endgame is, we won't see it coming." Oh, and yes you can dress up in disguises, as you'd expect from the Hitman studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IO Interactive's James Bond game was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-developer-announces-new-bond-game-project-007">first announced back in 2020</a> as Project 007, and since then we've learned very little about it. Still, from the off, IO said that it was developing a fresh James Bond origin story and a wholly original piece of work, rather than anything that followed the events of any particular film. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak has said he hoped 007 First Light would be the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy">start of a new trilogy of games</a>, though unfortunately the studio's beloved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-franchise-on-hiatus-as-io-interactive-focuses-on-james-bond-game">Hitman franchise is on hiatus</a> while IO works on this game.
