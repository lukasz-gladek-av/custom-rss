            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-fans-freak-out-again-as-playstation-anniversary-trailer-ends-on-bloodborne-and-the-phrase-its-about-persistence<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodborne fans are once again freaking out over a potential incoming announcement as Sony ended its special PlayStation 30th Anniversary trailer with a clip from the beloved FromSoftware game and the phrase "it's about persistence."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer, below, flashes through myriad clips from PlayStation history and ties many games to certain captions. Helldivers 2 has the phrase "it's about freedom," for example. FInal Fantasy 7 has the phrase "it's about fantasy." And Bloodborne, as mentioned, has the phrase "it's about persistence."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gothic horror role-playing game also ends the special, two minute long trailer, which some fans think adds further weight to the significance of its involvement.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It could be a simple reference to Bloodborne being a challenging game which requires persistence to conquer, of course, but as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-announces-maintenance-scheduled-for-playstations-30th-anniversary-and-as-youd-expect-fans-are-struggling-to-cope">a bizarrely timed maintenance period is also scheduled for the exact 30th anniversary date</a> of December 3, fans are crossing their fingers and donning their leather hats in anticipation of a long-awaited remaster or sequel announcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ending this video on Bloodborne truly is something," said @mathijnd on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkmonzpHVRg&amp;ab_channel=PlayStation" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>. "It's about persistence," said @davgil47. "That Bloodborne clip has a double meaning. They know we've been asking."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A screenshot of the Bloodborne clip is also at the top of the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/1h4x6cn/playstation_30th_anniversary_video_ended_with/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> page, and has more than 3,000 upvotes despite the trailer being just two hours old. "I know we’re joking," EdGeater said. "But this is actually the first time in my memory that Sony put Bloodborne in a sizzle reel."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They're doing this on purpose now," said another user. "It's a sign! The key to Bloodborne 2 is persistence," said someone else. "Saying 'it’s about persistence' on the Bloodborne part feels like a targeted attack on the community," another comment reads. "The light doesn't match the original game fight," pointed out someone else. "I'm wondering if this means something."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar sentiments can be seen all over social media, but fans will just have to wait until tomorrow, December 3, to see whether an announcement comes. Bloodborne launched on March 24, 2015 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review">is easily one of the most beloved PlayStation 4 games</a>, but developer FromSoftware has moved on to the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review">Dark Souls 3</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/21/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-review">Elden Ring</a> in the years since, while leaving the Sony-published Bloodborne behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have persisted in asking for a sequel or remaster or remake, however, so will be keeping an eye out tomorrow for any hints at a potential return to Yharnam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is definitely celebrating the anniversary of PlayStation in other ways, at least, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-psone-style-playstation-5-and-ps5-pro-as-part-of-30th-anniversary-collection">a range of PSOne themed hardware has also been released</a>. All PS5 users can also enjoy some nostalgic themes, as for a limited time <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-gets-psone-ps2-ps4-and-ps4-menu-themes-to-celebrate-30th-anniversary-of-playstation">menus can be transformed into those reminscent of the previous four generations</a> of PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Furthermore, IGN can exclusively reveal a first look at the Lara Croft miniature that will be included in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomb Raider: The Crypt of Chronos <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1708218446/tomb-raider-the-crypt-of-chronos?ref=discovery&amp;term=tomb%20raider&amp;total_hits=15&amp;category_id=34" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is set to start its Kickstarter in late May 2025,</a> and you can check out the first look at how Lara will look in the game below.

During the game, Lara is on a journey to the island of Kairos to search for an artifact said to "hold the reins of time." She will have to survive dangerous terrain, devious traps, and a familiar foe in Natla Technologies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the modes, the first one is called Adventure Book Mode and is meant to be a structured, story-driven experience that will guide players through various scenarios. There are various missions to undertake and they can last anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If players are looking for a longer adventure, Campaign Mode is the way to go as it will be a "vast, free-roaming experience on an expansive island map" that will take around three hours to complete. There will also be randomized locations and missions to keep things fresh for each new play session.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter which mode you play, there will be a crafting system that allows players to gather more powerful weapons, outfits, and abilities.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/02/kickstarter-preview-image-1-1733155795268.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, Iconiq Studios has confirmed that, while Tomb Raider: The Crypt of Chronos has been built around solo play like the games, it will let players bring a long some friends for the ride. It is designed around one playable character, but multiple players can work together to solve the problems Lara faces and complete the game in the best way possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we mentioned, Tomb Raider: The Crypt of Chronos will launch its Kickstarter in late May 2025 but you can check out more details <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1708218446/tomb-raider-the-crypt-of-chronos?ref=discovery&amp;term=tomb%20raider&amp;total_hits=15&amp;category_id=34" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by visiting the page right now.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more in the world of Tomb Raider, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft-review-netflix-hayley-atwell">our review of Netflix's Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft,</a> the news that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-thrones-sophie-turner-reportedly-in-line-to-play-lara-croft-in-prime-videos-tomb-raider-series">Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner is in talks to play Lara in the upcoming Prime Video series,</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/three-tomb-raider-games-from-an-awkward-time-in-lara-crofts-history-are-getting-remastered">the latest details on Tomb Raider IV - VI Remastered</a> ahead of its launch on February 14, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Have a tip for us?

Those who own them through GOG can still expect "a seamless experience and tech support" that will preserve "their experiences for years to come," however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GOG is also offering fans who don't yet own Warcraft 1 and 2 a discount code for the games, with users who enter "MakeWarcraftLiveForever" able to get a $2 or equivalent price reduction on the bundle containing both (otherwise priced at $14.99).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Owners of those titles can still expect a seamless experience and tech support for those titles.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The removal comes exactly one month after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcraft-1-and-2-remasters-shadow-dropped-with-improved-graphics-quality-of-life-improvements-and-other-new-features">Blizzard released remastered versions of Warcraft 1 and 2</a>, which are available on Battle.net for $9.99 and $14.99 respectively. The original versions of both games are also still available to purchase for $5.99 and $9.99 respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-owned-gog-begins-preservation-program-to-ensure-the-longevity-of-fallout-the-witcher-and-more">The GOG Preservation Program was also announced in November</a> as a means to ensure the longevity of over 100 games such as Fallout: New Vegas, The Witcher 2: Assassin's of Kings, Resident Evil, and more. Warcraft 1 and 2 feature on this list too, and GOG has used their delisting as an opportunity to make clear it will continue to support Preservation Program games even if they're removed from sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Once a game joins the Program, we pledge to maintain its compatibility even if it gets delisted from the store," it said. "This means that owners of those titles can still expect a seamless experience and tech support for those titles. This also considers potential changes in Windows OS that may impact games' playability."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PC Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Preservation is a growing concern for video game fans worldwide who worry about games new and old losing functionality as time goes on. A chief example comes in The Crew, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-sued-after-shutting-down-the-crew">which Ubisoft removed from sale and took offline in March</a>. This means The Crew, which was released in 2014, can no longer be played in any capacity, now or in the future. It no longer exists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Crew was an online-only game and therefore part of a category perhaps more at risk of delisting, but even single-player games are increasingly becoming at risk. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-your-copy-of-star-wars-jedi-survivor-might-need-a-big-day-one-download">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, for example, is a purely single-player game that launched only partly on-disc</a>. It otherwise required a download for the complete game, and therefore its physical version cannot exist without an internet connection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GOG said it wants hundreds of games to enter the GOG Preservation Program by the end of 2025, and that it currently has a long backlog of games currently being evaluated. Each game must pass through many quality tests before it is deemed of a high enough standard to enter the GOG Preservation Program. Games which fail will be improved upon until they match GOG's standards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
