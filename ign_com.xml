No teams are shifting over, no one is abandoning the game, and our plans to bring more awesome content to Space Marine 2 remain.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what are those plans? Space Marine 2’s year one roadmap remains, and Patch 7 is set to be released mid-April. But in the coming months Space Marine 2 will get a new class as well as new PvE operations and melee weapons. “Trust us, there are surprises even dataminers haven’t found out about :)” the statement teased.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This announcement simply marks the genesis of a new project, years away from release. We’ve made a decision and have just started the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Many of you were very excited for this project and this makes us incredibly happy and motivated. Thank you for the unwavering support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That being said, we still have a lot to offer to the players with Space Marine 2.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big announcement here is the new class, although the new melee weapon isn’t far behind. Fans are already speculating about what these could be. In terms of the new class, most assume it will be the Apothecary, as close to a medic class as Space Marines have. But there is hope that it could be the Librarian, which would mean super cool warp-powered space magic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the melee weapon, fans have already said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-players-want-one-thing-from-secret-levels-warhammer-40000-animation-in-the-game">they’d love to see the axe from Secret Level’s excellent Warhammer 40,000 animated episode in the game</a> — so much so that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-modders-put-the-axe-from-secret-levels-warhammer-40000-episode-into-the-game">modders went ahead and did it themselves</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The go-ahead for Space Marine 3 comes as little surprise given how well Space Marine 2 did. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>Speaking to IGN following Space Marine 2's launch</u></a>, Saber Interactive Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits said there was the possibility of story DLC, and revealed that ideas were already floating around for Space Marine 3. Without spoiling the Space Marine 2 campaign, it strongly suggests a continuation (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-have-a-good-idea-which-enemy-faction-theyll-fight-in-space-marine-3"><u>IGN has reported on the enemy faction we’ll probably see in Space Marine 3</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our game director Dmitry Grigorenko, he has proposed some story ideas that could either be DLC or a sequel,” Willits said at the time. “Yes, yes, yes! There's so many different factions... there are other chapters, too, that are interesting...”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-community-is-pinning-a-lot-of-hope-on-next-weeks-nintendo-direct<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">While some communities (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/congratulations-to-the-tomodachi-life-community-which-is-truly-living-the-dream-right-now">like the Tomodachi Life fans</a>) are having an absolute blast following today's Nintendo Direct, others aren't doing so hot. Specifically, I'm referring to the Hollow Knight: Silksong folks, who are once again putting on their clown makeup after no new trailer for the long-anticipated Hollow Knight sequel surfaced at the showcase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, there's another one next week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, the Silksong community has been a hot mess of anticipation and disappointment for a while. Pop into the subreddit or community Discord on a given day, and you'll be overwhelmed with constant memes and "silkposts" fantasizing, predicting, and joking about a game that seems like it will simply never arrive. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-fans-are-ready-to-have-their-hearts-broken-again-by-tuesdays-nintendo-direct">covered their antics last year</a>, when a pair of back-to-back Directs similarly sent the community reeling, and again in January when a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake">photo of chocolate cake</a> turned into a frantic search for an ARG that never was. At this point, it's honestly hard to tell from the outside looking in how much serious disappointment is involved here, and how much is just a tight-knit community of fans having a laugh every time a new showcase is announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there is, admittedly, something a little more pressing about this next showcase. Hollow Knight originally released for PC, but its climb to fame really kicked into gear when it launched on Nintendo Switch the following year, which has caused many to associate it with Nintendo's consoles moreso than any of the others it's released on. There's also a sense of grandeur about the showcase next week, specifically: it's a Nintendo Direct <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-switch-2-nintendo-direct-now-has-a-time-as-well-as-a-date">intended to show off the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, likely both the hardware and possibly also several launch titles. What better place for Silksong to re-debut? While there will naturally be a number of first-party games there, Hollow Knight fans are hoping against hope that Silksong has proven anticipated and popular enough to warrant a spot at such a massive showcase...and, critically, that the game is finally ready for prime time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Are Silksong fans likely about to have their hopes dashed yet again for something like the 50th time since the game was announced? I dunno, probably! There are a few other indicators that Silksong might be nearing some sort of release date announcement though. There was a passing reference to it about a week ago in an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-gets-casual-mention-in-xbox-indies-post-sends-community-into-a-fervor">Xbox Wire post on indies</a>, though that may have just been a cheeky joke. More interestingly, there have been some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-gets-steam-metadata-changes-that-point-to-2025-and-yes-were-doing-this-again">recent backend changes to the game's listing on Steam</a>, including a copyright year update. But we've also just spent several years getting overhyped for no reason about Silksong getting listed and delisted from various console storefronts randomly. So who knows, really?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All we do know, for absolute certain, is what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-insists-the-game-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-as-fans-obsess-over-a-picture-of-chocolate-cake">Team Cherry marketing and publishing chief Matthew 'Leth' Griffin said</a> back in January after the cake incident. "Yes the game is real, progressing, and will release." All we can do now is sit back, wait, and dream of what it will be like living in a post-Silksong world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Get that clown make-up ready for next week, folks!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
