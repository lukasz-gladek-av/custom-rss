He said this in response to an investor question regarding publishing competitors beginning to release $80 games, and where EA sees itself in relation to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wilson continued:</p><blockquote>That's in the construct of, we already offer a fairly broad pricing scheme across our various products. When you think about everything from free-to-play through to our premium products and deluxe editions, our orientation is always to capture the full spectrum of pricing so that we can serve players in the best way possible and offer them the greatest value. We'll continue to look at opportunities to deliver great value to our players thorugh various pricing schemes over the course of time, but no dramatic changes planned yet.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">EA also confirmed on the call that it hadn't factored in any changes to its existing pricing schemes to its expectations for the current fiscal year earnings guidance. The current fiscal year ends in March of 2026, so don't expect any $80 EA games between now and then. That means games like Madden NFL 26, EA Sports FC 26, and seemingly Battlefield 6 won't be $80, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-release-in-october-for-80-leak-suggests-and-theres-an-open-beta-coming-too">despite one leaker suggesting the contrary</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA isn't the only publisher who isn't quite ready to follow suit with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">Nintendo's Mario Kart World</a> on $80 games.
