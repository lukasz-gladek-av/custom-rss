When it comes to Game Speed, Bend has an option for letting players change the actual speed of gameplay, from 100% down to 75%, 50%, and 25%. The aim, as McAllister said, is to make it easier for players who struggle in high-pressure situations.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Game Speed is ideal for players who might feel overwhelmed in certain situations or have difficulty with various inputs in high pressure moments, specifically fighting off hordes of Freakers," said McAllister. "Hordes are a pillar in Days Gone gameplay and with our new Horde Assault mode arriving in the remaster, we wanted to make this unique combat experience more accessible to our players."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other parts of the accessibility options for Days Gone Remastered include subtitle colors, a customizable High Contrast Mode, UI Narration, and Collectible Audio Cues. The auto-complete QTE option, previously only allowed in Easy difficulty, is also getting enabled on any difficulty from Easy to Survival II.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While these options are all going to arrive in Days Gone Remastered, Bend Studios also confirmed most of the new accessibility features will be coming to Days Gone on PC as well. Some, like the feedback and customization control options, will require a compatible controller.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Days Gone Remastered was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/days-gone-remasered-revealed-with-april-2025-release-date">officially announced in February</a>, with some extra bells and whistles like an enhanced photo mode, permadeath and speedrun options, and the aforementioned accessibility features. The remaster of the 2019 biker-centric, post-apocalyptic zombie action-adventure isn't far off, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Days Gone Remastered will go live on April 25, 2025. Those who already have a PS4 version of Days Gone will be able to upgrade to the PS5 remastered version for $10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
