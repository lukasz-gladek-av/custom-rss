            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-delays-elden-ring-nightreign-patch-102-due-to-tsunami-warning-in-japan-as-massive-earthquake-off-russia-triggers-evacuations-across-pacific">a short delay due to a tsunami hitting Japan</a>, FromSoftware has released Elden Ring Nightreign patch 1.02, which finally adds duos mode to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Up to this point, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign</u></a> dropped players into the shifting lands of Limveld, exploring and fighting for survival either solo or in groups of three. There was no way to play two-player co-op.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first"><u>IGN's interview with Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki</u></a>, the Nightreign lead developer discussed the choice to lean on solos and trios as the core experience options for launch. When asked why there was no option for a pair of players to drop in together without a random matchmade third player, Ishizaki said it was overlooked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that," said Ishizaki. "As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start," Ishizaki continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed. So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Update 1.02, out now across PC via Steam, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S, adds two-player expeditions, a feature sorely lacking from the multiplayer-focused Elden Ring spin-off since launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After downloading the update, you’ll be able to start an expedition with two players. In the patch notes, below, FromSoftware said to reflect this change, the “Expedition Type” setting name has been changed to “Number of Players.” The game balance will be adjusted to the current number of players, the legendary developer added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, new filtering options have been added to the Relic Effect filter screen to allow a more precise selection of Relic effects. The patch also increases the number of Relic presets that can be registered to 100, and adds a feature to sell and favorite acquired Relics in the rewards and purchasing menus.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other notable changes include several UI adjustments and improvements, an adjustment for the probability of shifting earth occurring in Limveld, and the removal of the feature that causes the session to be disconnected when a certain amount of time passes without any action when the number of expedition participants is set to “1.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And amid the ongoing debate about the game's difficulty while playing single-player, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-director-has-soloed-every-boss-without-relics-and-wants-players-to-know-its-very-possible-to-see-everything"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign's director has revealed he soloed every boss without Relics</u></a>, and wanted players to know it's "very possible" to see everything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Elden Ring Nightreign Update 1.02 patch notes:<br>New features &amp; improvements</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added Two Player Expeditions.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">You may now start an expedition with two Players.
