            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-action-adventure-game-of-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-action-adventure-game-of-2024.1065504/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-action-adventure-game-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Video games as a medium is a home for all kinds of experiences and challenges, and the past decade has only seen that variety grow. But while we’re excited about games that break new boundaries, we’ll always have time for the classics, and there are few genres that feel quite as foundational as the action/adventure. Its roots go all the way back to the 1980s, and many of its formative games live on today, such as The Legend of Zelda and Prince of Persia – both of which saw new releases in 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while the action/adventure genre is a long-standing core pillar of gaming, it has changed, morphed, and evolved over the years. While we still have the 2D side-scrollers of yesteryear, we also have new subgenres that make the most of new ideas. For example, this year’s Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 is not just a technical showstopper, but a significant rethink on the relationship between story, exploration, and combat. Meanwhile, we can’t ignore the huge impact FromSoftware’s games have had on the genre, and this year’s Stellar Blade and Black Myth: Wukong both take ideas from the Souls series and rewrite them to fit their own goals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what action-packed adventure through digital worlds stole our hearts this year? Only one can take the title of Best Action/Adventure Game of 2024, and so here’s what the IGN editorial team decided…   </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Action / Adventure Game of 2024</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The IGN Awards are voted on by the entire IGN editorial team, and as you can imagine that means the final results reveal just how broad and varied our individual tastes in video games are (that will hardly come as a surprise, have you ever read the comment section of a review?) Naturally, some staff members vote for games that ultimately don’t prove popular enough to make it into a category’s finals, and we don’t want to leave those votes unacknowledged. In this case, we’d like to make honorable mentions for two sword-slashing epics: Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 and Rise of the Ronin. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/actionadventure-goty-2024-hellblade-2-1734457971619.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While not to everyone’s tastes, it’s easy to see why some people have come to adore Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2. It’s a graphical powerhouse, for sure, but it's the atmosphere those visuals generate that’s the real thing to be impressed by. It helps ground you in Senua’s challenging, hostile world – a land further brought to life by incredible audio design. Hellblade 2 is a narrow, focused adventure that almost comes across as an interactive movie more than it does an action game. But it's that focus that allows developer Ninja Theory to really deliver on its ambition of exploring the mental health issues that form the bedrock of this darkly personal-yet-cinematic series. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/actionadventure-goty-2024-rise-of-the-ronin-1734457989292.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In contrast to Senua’s small, contained journey is Team Ninja’s Rise of the Ronin, a massive open-world adventure set during the final years of Japan’s Edo period. It draws on many of the refined, Soulsian ideas established in the studio’s Nioh games, but retools them to create a much more expansive, somewhat easier-going experience. Make no mistake, this is still an action game in which sword stances, parries, and careful positioning are still vital, but the sprawling map allows for a very different approach to similar challenges while also offering up many new ideas and Assassin’s Creed-flavoured exploration. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Black Myth: Wukong</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/actionadventure-goty-2024-black-myth-wukong-1734458004791.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After years of impressive trailers and a strong showing at Gamescom 2023, Black Myth: Wukong arrived this year to a warm reception. It’s safe to say it has been one of, if not the most talked-about new game of the year, and for good reason: its boss-rush design allows it to put its best foot forward and showcase some exceptional combat. While certainly displaying some of the hallmarks of FromSoft-style battle, including limited health potions and careful observation of an enemy’s moveset, Black Myth: Wukong has its own original ideas to contribute to the action scene. Among the most interesting is the ability to momentarily transform into an enemy you’ve defeated on your travels, allowing you to become a giant frog that can slap your target with its elastic tongue; a shield-bearing warrior who can tank damage; or even a fiery wolf guardian with a unique moveset. These, along with other mystical abilities, help define Black Myth’s exciting approach to combat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the boss battles, though, developer Game Science’s latest is an exciting journey through a culture that rarely enjoys the AAA limelight. Black Myth: Wukong is unapologetically Chinese. It adapts and continues Journey to the West, and so is dense with classic Chinese mythology that may not be familiar to Western audiences brought up on American, European, and Japanese games. It’s this that allows Black Myth: Wukong to feel like something of a new, exciting frontier: while its gameplay may be Souls-ish and its gear system parallels God of War’s, its universe and storytelling are entirely its own. At least until the next Chinese AAA that hits big on the worldwide stage, that is.       </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Stellar Blade</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/actionadventure-goty-2024-stellar-blade-v2-1734458020027.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Stellar Blade is yet another action game victory for an East Asian developer. Created by South Korean studio Shift Up, Stellar Blade’s combat design is as razor sharp as its visuals – fast, responsive, and immensely rewarding. It too draws on FromSoftware for inspiration (in this case the fierce parry action of Sekiro) but blends that challenge with a stylish, ability-driven approach that combines sword strikes with grenades and guns. The result is an absolute blast, especially when it comes to the cinematic showdowns with grotesque Alpha Naytiba bosses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While both fans and Yoko Taro himself have recognised Stellar Blade’s relationship to Nier Automata, it’s also worth mentioning the game’s fascination with The Matrix – an influence that not only informs ship designs and place names, but also the story’s philosophical approach to AI, machines, and the survival of the human race. Stellar Blade doesn’t quite live up to the lofty bar of its inspirations when it comes to story, but its biome-hopping adventure certainly asks questions in many of the right places.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/actionadventure-goty-2024-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-1734458035916.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There are, of course, two sides to the action/adventure genre. Where Stellar Blade and Black Myth: Wukong clearly go all-in on the action part, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle dedicates itself almost wholly to adventure. That’s not to say the folks at developer MachineGames haven’t put their famous Wolfenstein-honed anti-fascist skills to good use – you can’t have an Indiana Jones game without punching a Nazi every now and again, after all. But the Great Circle surprisingly has more in common with the likes of Broken Sword and Dishonored than it does Uncharted or Tomb Raider. It’s this surprisingly fresh approach to Dr. Jones’ digital adventures that makes the Great Circle feel so faithful to the films that inspired it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stepping into the shoes of Indy (as well as putting your head in his hat), you explore the corridors of the Vatican, tombs of the Ancient Egyptians, and rivers of Siam. Each intricately designed hub level is the canvass for organic exploration – the more you dig into an area’s history and secrets, the more it reveals its hidden pathways and undiscovered relics. While there’s always a main story mission that pushes towards the inevitable puzzle-filled tomb, each zone also offers up excellent “fieldwork” side missions that not only provide even more adventure and archaeology work, but neatly tie into the core story to provide a denser, more fulfilling experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games often claim they can make you really “feel” like their protagonists, but MachineGames absolutely scored the golden idol on this one: smart puzzles, a genuine sense of discovery, and a solid amount of stealth encounters-turned-whip-cracking battles ensures the Great Circle is one of the best action/adventure games of the year. Not only that, it’s also Indiana Jones’ best adventure since 1989. Now that’s something worthy of a place in a museum.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner: Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/actionadventure-goty-2024-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-1734458055928.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1989 designer Jordan Mechner created a revolutionary leap with Prince of Persia. A tricky adventure that combined 2D side-scrolling platforming with swashbuckling combat, it remains a cornerstone of video gaming’s foundations to this day. 35 years later, Ubisoft Montpellier created Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown; an excellent return to the series’ 2D roots and – in the IGN team’s opinion – the best action/adventure game of 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like many successful games with a long and storied legacy, The Lost Crown is a smart blend of the old and new. It pulls on the dastardly trap-filled level design of Mechner’s original game, but those lethal pathways have been extended and looped to create a modern, interconnected metroidvania map. This world provides a perfectly judged exploration challenge, allowing you the space to investigate every layer and corner while also frequently asking you to prove your skill in order to navigate through swinging pendulums and over deadly spike pits.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Excellent enemy design and parry-filled engagements ensures The Lost Crown feels like a sharp and satisfying combat challenge, especially when it comes to its centrepiece boss battles. Again, it's that blend of old and new – the swashbuckling blades of classic Prince of Persia, augmented with the supernatural smarts of The Sands of Time and the responsiveness of Hollow Knight – that makes The Lost Crown such a winner. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the game’s real secret weapon is perhaps its most simple addition to the formula: a camera. The campaign’s design leans on the locked gate traditions of classic metroidvanias, asking you to explore further and deeper in search of keys to those barriers. But that gameplay loop often results in doors being forgotten, the treasures behind them left unfound. But The Lost Crown allows you to snap a photo of a progress blocker and pin it to the map – a constant reminder of that place you couldn’t get into hours earlier. And so the moment you find the key, you’ll know exactly where you need to return. It’s a game-changer for the genre, and this feature alone would have been enough to secure The Lost Crown a space on this list. Combined with its many other achievements, though, this year’s Prince of Persia becomes a more-than-worthy winner of our award for the best action/adventure game of 2024.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It has a simple, one Psychic Energy for 20 damage attack, but where things get interesting is in its second attack: Genome Hacking.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/mew-1734619786157.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Choose one of your opponent's Active Pokémon's attacks and use it as this attack," it reads. This means Mew ex can copy even the best attacks in the game, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Charizard ex's 200 damage Crimson Storm and Mewtwo ex's 150 damage Psydrive</a>, which both cost four Energy but come at the cost of discarding two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every aspect of the attack is copied, so Mew will also lose two Energy when using either of these, but what makes Genome Hacking particularly interesting is its cost at three Colorless Energy. This allows Mew, despite being a Psychic type Pokémon itself, to work in every deck without compromise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is so poignant because of how Mewtwo ex works. It dominated the Genetic Apex meta alongside Pikachu ex but thanks to the Mythical Island boost and PIkachu ex's fall off, it seemingly now stands alone at the top.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mewtwo ex has 150 HP and its Psydrive attack does 150 damage. Pikachu ex could get in quick enough to stop it reaching this explosive attack, but the only other real counter to Mewtwo ex was the similarly powerful Charizard ex, which struggled to gain traction in the meta for other reasons, and Mewtwo ex itself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/mewtwoex-1734619823481.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mirror matches between two Mewtwo ex players were therefore essentially races to see who could draw the supporting Gardevoir cards first, thus unleashing Psydrive and essentially ending the game. But thanks to Mew, every single deck in the game can now have its own version of Mewtwo ex, and one that can be activated quicker given its three Energy cost compared to Mewtwo ex's four.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can simply insert Mew ex into their decks and deploy it if coming up against a Mewtwo ex, removing its previously straightforward means of victory and, at the very least, allowing for a more dynamic match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mewtwo ex decks will slot in Mew ex for the same reason, to have more control in the mirror match, and this already appears to be having a positive effect on the Pokémon TCG Pocket meta by injecting some diversity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The digital trading card game arrived October 30 and is a certified hit for Creatures Inc. and The Pokémon Company, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">having earned an estimated $200 million in its first month</a> across more than 60 million downloads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This huge amount of money comes as Pokémon TCG Pocket follows the standard mobile and free to play game model, flooding players with rewards in the first few days before soon drying up, with spending real world money the only real way to re-experience that early thrill <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-reveals-mew-led-set-coming-next-week-and-60-million-download-milestone">outside of the occasional set drop like Mythical Island</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing Genetic Apex, the first set of cards which totals 226 officially but also contains 60 rare alternate art cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take players not spending money around two years according to one estimate</a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-player-reveals-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-complete-the-first-set-after-spending-1500">those looking to make it rain can wrap up the collection after dropping around $1,500</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
