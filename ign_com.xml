            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"They can't get the hardware. It's really difficult right now."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A fresh report has detailed the difficulties faced by some developers keen to launch games for Switch 2 — but who remain unable to do so due to a lack of Nintendo support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0SW7R5H5wY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a>, Nintendo is still restricting its supply of Switch 2 development hardware and instead telling some studios to launch their titles as Switch 1 games that can then be played via backwards compatibility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This has sparked frustration among a number of developers, including at least one major AAA studio unable to launch a Switch 2-native version of their game, while hardware is given to some indie creators — including the team behind a campfire simulator.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's been a lot of talk about this lately, that Nintendo seems to be almost discouraging Switch 2 development to some degree," Digital Foundry's John Linneman said during the team's most recent podcast. "I've spoken with plenty of developers where they were told that their game, they should just ship it on Switch 1 and rely on backwards compatibility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's a lot of developers that are unable to get Switch 2 dev kits," Linneman continued. "We talked to a lot of devs at Gamescom this year, and so many of them said the same things. They want to ship on Switch 2. They would love to do Switch 2 versions. They can’t get the hardware. It's really difficult right now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One particular frustration has been the lack of transparency from Nintendo on why some studios have been given Switch 2 development kits, while others have not. IGN has contacted Nintendo for comment. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't really know what Nintendo’s mindset was with these sets of decisions," Digital Foundry's Oliver Mackenzie said. "I don’t really understand the strategy because, like you said, even now developers are struggling to get systems, and I know that some months ago when we were hearing things through the grapevine and talking to people, there were some weird exclusions with some big developers struggling to get kits for games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"From what we've heard, there were some weird inclusions as well," he continued. "Some indies were included, which is nice to see. But there’s that campfire game, you know, the camera campfire game, and they’re getting kits. And some big developers, on the other hand, who developed AAA stuff, aren’t necessarily in the pipeline there for kits."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The camera campfire game here in question is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/chillin-by-the-fire">Chillin' by the Fire</a>, an indie hangout game set around a campfire which makes use of the Switch 2 camera. On the one hand, the simple fact this makes use of GameChat and the Switch 2's camera capabilities makes this impossible to launch on Switch 1, meaning that development hardware for Nintendo's newer console would be required. On the other, it's understandable why some AAA developers might be surprised to see this launch, after being told they wouldn't yet receive a Switch 2 development kit for themselves.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's weird stuff about discouraging Switch 2 development explicitly for some games, a limited subset of games like if you're doing a pixel art game at 240p, you probably don't need a Switch 2 kit," Mackenzie added. "But there are very few games on the Switch 1 that wouldn't benefit from being ported explicitly to Switch 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The thing that’s really stark to me too is, at this point, we’ve seen very few proper Switch 2 Editions post-launch. I don’t think we’ve seen any, hardly at all really, from third-party developers in particular. Obviously we saw No Man’s Sky, I think one or two other games in the mix there. But really, it’s been a very slow trickle of titles earning that Switch 2 Edition badge. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I really want to see more movement on that front. I hope it’s a temporary thing," Mackenzie concluded. "I hope that in a year or two, we’re looking back and we’re like, that was a really weird decision, but it was fixed in time. I hope that’s what we’re looking at."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier today, it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-reportedly-set-for-september-as-metroid-prime-4-release-date-and-mario-40th-anniversary-speculation-mounts">Nintendo was planning a fresh Direct due this September</a>, with fan hopes high for word on Metroid Prime 4 and Mario details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The next season of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> will include the long-awaited return of Mythical unicorn Keldeo — though players who paid $7.99 to own the creature during its original release will not be given a second, IGN has been told.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Go's 20th season, Tales of Transformation, will mark the first time Keldeo has been available in the game since December 2022, when a limited-time Special Resarch including the creature was briefly sold. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lengthy wait for it to become available again has been a growing source of frustration among players over the last few years, especially newer fans who have been waiting to unlock its Pokédex entry.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All players will be given research centering on Keldeo as part of the season's main storyline — something which will also unlock the beast's previously unobtainable Resolute Form. However, IGN was told in a pre-announcement briefing that existing Keldeo owners will not receive a second Keldeo as part of this research, and will instead simply receive more Keldeo candy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's new season details come amid a flurry of reveals from the Pokémon Go team, including yesterday's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-go-boosting-level-cap-and-rebalancing-experience-in-first-major-xp-change-for-5-years">major announcement that the game's level cap will be raised from 50 to 80 in October</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other (less major but very cute) news, an in-game celebration was announced this morning for the Netflix stop-motion series Pokémon Concierge, including a special Psyduck in a rubber ring costume. Looking ahead, datamining suggests that details of 2025's year-end Pokémon Go Wild Area event are on the horizon, while evidence points to some kind of remote trading option also being worked upon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
