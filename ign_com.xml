            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: This review specifically covers the Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. For our thoughts on the other modes, see our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review"><em>campaign review</em></a><em> or our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review"><em>multiplayer review</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite playing a new one every year, I never know what to make of modern Call of Duty – a first-person shooter so big, so successful that it is no longer a standalone game but a platform with file sizes so large it asks you to choose the other two things you’d like to have installed on your PC or console. This year’s PC release comes with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/How_to_Enable_Secure_Boot_on_PC_for_BO7"><u>frustrating new anti-cheat</u></a> that seemingly caused my CPU fan to choose death instead, so while I would normally base my playtime on that version, as God intended, I am initially slumming it on PlayStation 5 to bring you some early impressions of this year’s Zombies mode. I still have tons left to see as the community collectively hunts for Easter eggs and solves mysteries, but so far I’m interested in digging into what’s here, even if it may take a bit to get to the vital organs underneath these bones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zombies is my favorite part of Call of Duty, simultaneously the stupidest, silliest side thing the series has ever done and probably big enough to be a small video game in its own right. I remarked on a similar feeling in last year's review, but remember when this was a serious game series about war, and you were storming the beaches of Normandy, machine gun fire spraying sand in your face? When you died, you used to get quotes about how terrible war was from men who had lived it. Now, I play roulette on a big mystery box covered with skulls for weapons, the best of which is a ray gun, so I can shoot zombies in the face while a disembodied voice who calls himself the Warden taunts me from afar; my character quips about how said voice reminds him of his high school gym teacher. Zombies has been doing this for a while now, but I still don’t know whether to laugh or weep.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is allegedly a story here – Raul Menendez, who apparently has been alive and drinking beer on his porch for the last decade, is back and threatening to cause chaos the world over, there’s a shady security company somehow involved, and massive, violent zombie death, of course. All of it is very well-produced and so goofy that the only thing I could do was watch the introductory cutscene while emulating the face that I imagine a cow would make if you gave it cocaine, chuckle a little, and get on with it. I suppose I answered my own question there, huh?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year’s Zombies is hard to get a handle on so far because so much of what Zombies does will come down to the community working out the new maps in the coming days and perhaps weeks. Right now, we’re all kind of bumbling about, figuring out what’s what, which is simultaneously fun and frustrating. Many of the pain points from last year remain early on – for instance, you can’t make your loadout until you hit level four, which means if Zombies is all you want to do (and for me, it is), you’re stuck with a pistol and whatever you can earn by buying stuff on the walls after you’ve dispatched enough undead. Remember when games just let you have fun from the outset instead of unlocking it?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I still love sliding at a group of zombies and firing a shotgun until they’re paste.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, the underpinnings of Zombies feel much the same. You’re on a map, you open up new doors and paths with currency you earn, and you’ve got Pack-a-Punch machines to upgrade your guns. There’s additional armor you can apply plastered to the walls, an Arsenal to really crank up specific aspects of your weapons, Gobblegums for a little flavor if your mouth is lonely and you want a mid-battle pick-me-up, and so on. And of course, while you’re managing all of this, the undead rise and hunger for flesh. Ghouls, man. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gameplay here is similar to last year’s – I still love sliding at a group of zombies and firing off a shotgun until they’re just paste and all that. No, what’s new are the maps. I’ve played both maps in their round-based modes, Ashes of the Damned and Vandorn Farm (the latter seems to be a part of the former, but I haven’t reached it in the standard mode yet), and so far I prefer the farm. Ashes of the Damned seems to be home to what will be the more traditional “find the secrets to finish the map” fare, while Vandorn Farm is more of a “you’re locked in here with the undead, kid, so try not to die too much” deal.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Our run on the former ended when one of my teammates, who didn’t communicate with the rest of us, grabbed a truck and started driving it to the next objective… before he decided it might be more fun to smash into the zombies until it exploded. The rest of us spent most of the map either trying to catch up to the truck or waiting in vain to be revived after we all died. It went about as well as you’d think. I’m interested in seeing what Ashes of the Damned has to offer with a more talkative crew; right now, if you’d told me I’d hallucinated the whole thing, I’d believe you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The farm is more old-school. Zombies hang from the rafters in the big barn, the smaller one houses the Mystery Box where each of my teammates made offerings in the fleeting hope of a Ray Gun, and there was a house with a skeleton family sitting at the dinner table and a roof in desperate need of, well, more roof. It was a much more interesting map than Ashes of the Damned, and I enjoyed navigating its twists and turns, learning where everything was, and spending the in-between time killing the misbegotten horrors that were formerly people.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As is usually the case, success will largely depend on how the maps shake out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem, once again, was that we couldn’t figure out what to do yet. There was some mysterious infection growing on one of the machines that seemed to power the farm, but after we destroyed it, our objective told us to wait for it to come back. So we did, killing zombies and upping the round count. The issue is the infection never did reappear. Normally, this is a good thing. The antibiotics worked and the patient is recovering well, thank you. In this case, it meant we got to round eight, nothing happened, the four of us spent several minutes looking for any zombies we somehow missed or a way to progress, and then all three of my teammates left the game after we couldn’t figure out what came next. Hard to blame them. The farm’s cool, but I'd prefer something with some warmer colors and fewer rotting corpses, you know?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like I said, I’m never sure what to make of Call of Duty, and that extends to this year’s Zombies. It certainly plays well and you can see the absurd amount of money spent to develop it on-screen – but the ooey, gooey, juicy parts of the mode haven’t revealed themselves to me quite yet. As is usually the case, its success will largely depend on how the maps shake out. I’ll need a bonesaw and a ribspreader to get to the still-beating heart of this thing, but that’s fine. I can’t say I’m not interested in seeing what’s in there. I just hope I don’t get anything on me in the process.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-zombies-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision has issued a statement in response to player outcry regarding the seeming use of generative AI art assets in a number of areas of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have been taking to social media today to complain about images they believe to be AI-generated across the game, primarily focusing on calling card images that they claim appear to use Studio Ghibli styling, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/studio-ghibli-ai-trend-sparks-chatgpt-backlash-resurfaces-old-comments-from-hayao-miyazaki-and-even-zelda-williams-has-waded-in">a trend of AI-Ghibli images from earlier this year</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I havent really looked at the Multiplayer and Zombie calling cards as closely and im willing to bet they're using ai on those too but its only the Campaign and endgame calling cards that are this type of blatant Sora/Grok artstyle <a href="https://t.co/5qmEXhoQkJ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/5qmEXhoQkJ</a></p>— Kume (@Kumesicles) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kumesicles/status/1989327996126126344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In response to this outcry, Activision has issued a statement to a number of outlets, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-under-fire-for-using-what-sure-looks-like-ai-generated-studio-ghibli-style-calling-card-art/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including PC Gamer</a>, that acknowledges the issue...sort of: "Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players. Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth pointing out that the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Steam page also includes the following disclaimer: "Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets." Not exactly descriptive!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time Call of Duty has come under fire for this, either. This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">exact scenario played out back in February</a>, when Activision admitted that it had used generative AI in the development of Black Ops 6, including in a zombie Santa loading screen that angry fans referred to as "AI slop."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-responds-to-generative-ai-backlash-not-replace-but-streamline">just this past August</a>, Black Ops 7 associate creative director Miles Leslie clarified the team's stance on the technology further:</p><blockquote>“We live in a world now, where there are AI tools. I think our official statement we said last year, around Black Ops 6, is that everything that goes into the game is touched by the team a hundred percent. We have generative AI tools to help us, but none of that goes in-game.</blockquote><blockquote>"And then you're going to say, ‘Yeah, but it has.' I'll say it has by accident. And that was never the intention. We've come out and been very clear that we use these as tools to help the team, but they do not replace any of the fantastic team members we have that are doing the final touches and building that content to put it in the game.</blockquote><blockquote>“So everything you play: human-created and touched. AI tools in the world we live in: it's how do we streamline it? That's really the goal. Not replace, but streamline.”</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, IGN asked why the zombie Santa and other generative AI images hadn't been removed from the game yet, to which Leslie said that was not his department, and that "the team is actively looking at that stuff." It is unclear if, why, or how Activision's stance on this has changed over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is out now. We've given the campaign a try and aren't totally crazy about it, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">with our reviewer saying</a> it's " a wild one thanks to the scope of its ambition, but the big swings it takes don't always land, leaving it an uneven step down from last year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

In a brief shot, we saw Mario and Luigi riding motorcycles across the desert in the outfits they're wearing above, before shooting off a sand dune and revealing the same Inverted Pyramid in a valley below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, at the time, that just seemed like one piece of a larger montage of areas the brothers might visit during their adventures across the galaxy. Dedicating an entire poster to it prompts questions as to whether or not The Super Mario Galaxy Movie might significantly feature components of Super Mario Odyssey's story. Will we see more kingdoms? Perhaps Cappy?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, both The Super Mario Bros. Movie and what we know of this new sequel do play fast and loose with what Mario games they borrow from. The Super Mario Bros. Movie was full of references and didn't really follow the loose plot (such as they are) of any game in particular, and we already know The Super Mario Galaxy Movie will feature Bowser Jr. as a prominent villain, complete with his Super Mario Sunshine paintbrush. We even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-spotted-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer">suspect he's using Wonder abilities from Super Mario Bros.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">At least Dispatch is really good!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft was, at one point not too long ago, working on a brand new Splinter Cell game. But it morphed over time to become XDefiant, according to a new report.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzE0MzM2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNzQ4MTY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVFBMDdHUEZIUlYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.fNOncm0D1BfbWI9RAgwCB6j8SI8mW9RhRD76EEz1TYo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg story about AdHoc Studio</a>, the developers of workplace superhero comedy game Dispatch, which describes their journey from Telltale Games to Ubisoft to their own independent studio. The leadership of AdHoc began working together at Telltale Games, working on Tales from the Borderlands, before Nick Herma, Dennis Lenart, and Pierre Shorette departed for Ubisoft in 2017. There, the trio worked on a new entry in the Splinter Cell franchise.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it’s been dormant for a while,” Herman told Bloomberg. “And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, they explain that Ubisoft was beginning to push games as a service hard across its portfolio, and Splinter Cell didn't quite fit that mould. Over time, the Splinter Cell project transformed into what would become xDefiant, a free-to-play first-person shooter that launched to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xdefiant-review">middling reviews</a> last year and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">shut down just this past June, taking two entire studios with it</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trio eventually reunited with Michael Choung, another former colleague from Telltale, to start AdHoc Studio in 2018. While working on a version of what would eventually become Dispatch, they also took on a scriptwriting co-dev gig on The Wolf Among Us 2, only to pull out of the project after writing an 800-page script due to frustrations with a lack of creative control. That project, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/telltale-games-has-allegedly-laid-off-most-of-its-workers">last we heard of it</a>, seemed similarly ill-fated.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, though, the group was able to pull together the final version of Dispatch with the support of both a publisher and a number of well-known actors thanks to casting director Linda Lamontagne. A last-minute deal with Critical Role for another game helped get them across the finish line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Splinter Cell, fans remain bereft of a new game, with the last new Splinter Cell title being Blacklist from way, way back in 2013. There's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-very-early-look-at-splinter-cell-remake">allegedly a remake of the original 2002 game in the works</a>, but Ubisoft has been so quiet about it since 2022 that it's hard to say whether or not it will ever fully emerge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dispatch, meanwhile, is excellent. We're <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-review">working on a review in progress</a> as each episode comes out, but you can read our thoughts on the first two episodes here for now, where our reviewer says they're "totally enthralled in this world, and I’m keen to get tangled up in Robert’s fractured personal life."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

All cards involved are reprints of existing cards with Monster Hunter themes, nothing mechanically unique or new. The press release includes some basic information about each of the drops, titled respectively The Hunt, The Hunters, The Monsters, and The Monsters II, but no card images as of yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Hunt</strong> focuses on non-creature spells, themed around "the terrifying attacks that monsters across the Monster Hunter franchise can unleash." There is one spell of each color:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1x Blind Obedience: Malzeno from <em>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</em></li><li>1x Snap: Kushala Daora from <em>Monster Hunter 2</em></li><li>1x Village Rites: Magnamalo and Tobi-Kadachi from <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></li><li>1x Mizzium Mortars: Yian Garuga from <em>Monster Hunter Generations</em> and <em>Monster Hunter 2</em></li><li>1x Tooth and Nail: Azure Rathalos and Seregios from <em>Monster Hunter 4</em></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Hunters</strong> is, as it sounds, about the hunters themselves, with each card depicting a different set of armor and weapons and having the human creature subtype. As before, there's one spell of each color:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1x Grand Abolisher: Tigrex Armor with Bone Scythes from Monster Hunter Generations and Monster Hunter Freedom 2</li><li>1x Archaeomancer: Velkhana Armor with Slinger and Winged Seraphyd Greatsword from Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</li><li>1x Grim Haruspex: Nargacuga Armor with a Hidden Eye Light Bowgun from Monster Hunter P2G/MHFU</li><li>1x Imperial Recruiter: Rathalos Armor with Red Tigrex Claws; Brachydios Armor with Burning Knocker; Gore Malaga Armor and Royal Rose from Monster Hunter 4G</li><li>1x Champion of Lambholt: Astalos Armor with Verdant Lightning Shield from Monster Hunter Generations.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Monsters </strong>and <strong>The Monsters II</strong> are similarly self-explanatory, including the following monsters as legendary creatures. These are two different sets, but the press release is unclear exactly how these nine creatures will be split between them.
