            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After weeks of dry restocks, Target has the Nintendo Switch 2 available again (for now). Both the standard console and the Mario Kart World Bundle are back up for order (while supplies last), giving anyone who missed out at launch a rare shot to pick one up at retail price. Target’s listings aren’t behind a waitlist like Amazon’s invitation system either. Over in the world of Pokémon, the Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box has dropped to $102.94 on Amazon, undercutting TCGPlayer’s listing by over $10. That’s a solid deal in the middle of Pokémania 2025, especially for sealed collectors or someone who needs that Illustration Rare Team Rocket’s Wobbuffet promo.</p><div catalogid="e3df206f-2b99-4347-afac-38395c81c6ca" id="225564"><div id="225564" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Students and Teachers Can Save 57% Off the Adobe Creative Cloud Pro Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>The Creative Cloud Pro bundle includes 20+ apps, including Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Premiere Pro, and more for just $29.99 per month (normally $69.99).</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out today's best offers, collectors can lock in a preorder for the Tamashii Nations Cyclops S.H.Figuarts figure at $100, complete with multiple optic blast effects and poseable parts straight from the GAMERVERSE. Small Soldiers fans can relive ‘90s chaos with the new 4K Steelbook edition for $25.99, while Firefly diehards get a definitive version of Serenity in its 20th Anniversary 4K Steelbook for $29.96, loaded with extras. And if you're tired of throwing money at canned air, the RELIDOL 100000RPM Electric Air Duster is just $27.99 today, offering powerful cordless cleaning that pays for itself fast.</p></div><p id="destined-rivals-elite-trainer-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box">Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225515"><div id="225515" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now down to $102.94, beating TCG Players' price of $114.99 plus postage.

Not only is the Black Bolt ETB vastly undercutting the secondary market, Paradox Rift ETB is even cheaper (And an overlooked set in my opinion, stock up now). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's other great deals on ex boxes too, which are also near MSRP and around the same or just under listings on TCG Player. The sealed market is becoming more competitive, so it's more important than ever to give eBay a quick check before hitting buy.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Nintendo Switch 2 Stock Updates</h2></p><div catalogid="e7c6732a-ef4d-47d3-8a5e-d382139346bf" id="225579"><div id="225579" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Switch 2 - Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In a shocking move, Target is selling both Nintendo Switch 2 SKUs without preorders, waiting lists or raffles, so snap them up quickly. As predicted, Nintendo Switch 2's launch window is seeing stock shortages. If you didn't preorder at launch, you've probably been waiting for stock drops since launch.</p></div><div catalogid="e7c6732a-ef4d-47d3-8a5e-d382139346bf" id="225578"><div id="225578" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Switch 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon currently has it's invitation system in place for both the standard console SKU and the Mario Kart world bundle, so it's always worth getting on the waiting list whilst you wait.

It even includes a special mount for background displays.</p></div><p id="small-soldiers-4k-uhd-steelbook-di"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Small Soldiers 4K UHD Steelbook + Di">Small Soldiers 4K UHD Steelbook + Digital</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225575"><p data-cy="paragraph">Joe Dante’s Small Soldiers is back with a bang in this new 4K UHD Steelbook edition, now just $25.99 (down from $30.99) on Amazon.

Directed by Joss Whedon and starring Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk, and Summer Glau.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">The Legend of Zelda Hardcover Book Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly every The Legend of Zelda hardcover book you need for your collection is available in this sale with some cracking discounts. It includes my favorite one,  Hyrule Historia, that fills in more than a few gaps in the LoZ lore, although the timeline has already been slightly retconned. It also includes full and expanded official guides for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">KRK Kreate Powered Studio Monitors</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can personally guarantee a set of powered studio monitors will sound better than almost any sound system with or without a subwoofer. The new line of KRK Kreate studio monitors aren't just for recording music (Although they'd do an amazing job), they're a versatile sound option for content creation, editing, gaming, watching TV and movies and more. Buyers can even teather to them via Bluetooth for no fuss connections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been using the 8-inch speaker models for a couple of weeks now, and they destory my soundbar and subwoofer combo that cost's nearly double the price of these. There's precision adjustments knobs on the back, which I keep mostly in neutral with volume up by half for a crisp flat sound with the right amount of bass. Although that can be cranked up when needed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally I use an audio splitter so my Krate 8s can handle my Nano QuadCortex guitar amp moddler, my TV audio and gaming PC audio for the best experience. For me, going from a 3-inch to 8-inch speaker option is night and day. The clarity difference and range is top-tier, not to mention the jack, XLR and aux outputs available on each monitor that fits in perfectly in everyone's setup. You're getting top-of-the-range brand quality without the "gaming" brand tax, it's a win-win.</p><p id="apple-airpods-pro-2"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods Pro 2">Apple AirPods Pro 2</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225530"><div id="225530" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">AirPods Pro 2 are one of those earbuds I keep noticing for their mix of sound quality and thoughtful features. At $199, they offer a strong balance of value and performance. The active noise cancellation blocks out a lot of background noise while adaptive audio automatically adjusts based on your surroundings. You get four sizes of silicone tips for a customizable fit, and once those are set they stay comfortable even through longer listening sessions. The personalized spatial audio and hearing aid features add extra depth, giving them more flexibility than just a standard pair of wireless earbuds.</p></div><p id="iniu-portable-charger-10000mah-45w"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU Portable Charger 10000mAh 45W">INIU Portable Charger 10000mAh 45W</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225531"><div id="225531" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU Portable Charger 10000mAh 45W</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is ideal for carrying around when you've forgot to stick your phone on charge overnight, 45W is more than enough power to charge anything whilst using it, from phones to Nintendo Switch 2.
