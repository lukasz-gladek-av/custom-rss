Indeed, Trailer 2 was captured on a PS5 (the trailer specifically mentions PS5, as opposed to PS5 Pro).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what does this mean for the inevitable PC launch, or perhaps even a release on the Nintendo Switch 2? Some had wondered, perhaps even hoped, that GTA 6’s push to May 2026 would cause a rethink at Rockstar and parent company Take-Two and spark a simultaneous release on PC. The lack of mention of PC here perhaps suggests otherwise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an omission in keeping with developer Rockstar’s playbook for its previous games, but in 2025 and certainly in 2026 it feels outdated. And, given the increasing importance of the PC for a multiplatform game’s success, is GTA 6’s no-show on PC a missed opportunity or even a mistake?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025?utm_source=threads,twitter">IGN put that question to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick in an interview in February</a>, and in his response he teased GTA 6’s <em>eventual</em> release on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So with Civ 7 it's available on console and PC and Switch right away,” Zelnick said of Firaxis' recently launched Civilization 7. “With regard to others in our lineup, we don't always go across all platforms simultaneously. Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/gta-6-main-1746545044332.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">GTA 6 is still set to launch on console only.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar fans have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years. Still, some had hoped that a game as big as GTA 6 could be a turning point for the studio's PC gaming attitude.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Rockstar titles tend to get to PC eventually, but the question of how long PC gamers will have to wait for what could end up being one of the biggest games ever remains. If not May 2026, then when? Fall 2027? Early 2027? A year later, in May 2027?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstar <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-rockstar-dev-tries-to-explain-why-gta-6-is-coming-to-pc-after-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s"><u>attempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hits PS5 and Xbox Series X and S</u></a>, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how big of a missed opportunity could skipping PC for GTA 6’s launch be? Zelnick told IGN that the PC version of a multiplatform game can generate 40% of overall sales, or even more with certain games.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Lucia Caminos Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue,” he said. “Of course, there will be a new console generation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, there’s no Nintendo Switch 2 logo on GTA 6 Trailer 2, which is perhaps expected. While we still don’t know exactly what the Switch 2 is capable of, it is set to get CD Projekt’s Cyberpunk 2077, so there was some hope that GTA 6, which, let’s remember, is still down as coming to the less powerful Xbox Series S, could make its way to Nintendo’s next-gen console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
