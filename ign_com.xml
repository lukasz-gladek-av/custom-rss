            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trading-card-storage-ideas<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Not all cards are meant to be played with. If you’re into collectibles already or just starting to collect trading cards, you may have a big enough collection that warrants some extra care or bulk storage. Some of your cards may even have significant value or will continue to grow in value, depending on what cards you collect and how you store them. As an investment, many serious collectors go to significant lengths to protect their cards such as sleeving or even double-sleeving them. However, even if your cards aren’t worth much monetarily, they are still nostalgic and special to you; whether it be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-tcg-deals">Pokémon TCG</a>, Yu-Gi-Oh, sports cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-magic-the-gathering-mtg-deals">MTG cards</a> (shoutout the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">new Final Fantasy collection</a>), X-Men cards, or others. That said, you should consider the right dedicated storage option for your type of collection and your budget.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Jump to:</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, just like with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-video-game-storage-ideas">video game storage</a>, there are all sorts of carefully crafted containers you can use to protect your trading cards these days. If you’re just getting into collecting now, starting to collect more, or you simply want to upgrade your storage option from the old ring binder you’ve been using since the 1990s, this (unranked) list is for you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some focus on security above all else, many others are stylish and portable too, making it easy and fun to tote your cards out and about. For all of you card collectors, see our picks below of the best trading card storage options for every situation, collection size and budget. Happy collecting!</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="best-overall">1. Quiver Time Quiver Card Case</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best All-Around Pick</h3><div id="197208" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Quiver Time The Quiver Card Case</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Carry your cards in style! Comes with 100 Apollo transparent card sleeves.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Quiver cases are almost universally adored in the card gaming community, and it’s easy to see why. Whatever your storage needs, it’s quite possible a single quiver case will fit the bill. It’s big enough to hold over a thousand unsleeved cards, yet it’s also sturdy and portable, coming with wrist and shoulder carrying straps, a tough shell with a water-resistant faux-leather finish and a secure zip closure. So it’s just as useful whether you’re storing cards in the home or carrying them out to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the best thing about Quiver Time, though, is the stylish design and attention to detail. They come in a variety of colors to suit your preference and have all sorts of thoughtful little extras. There’s a sheath to keep the zip tabs closed, fully adjustable straps, some card sleeves and removable acrylic dividers and corner cushions to help keep your cards organized. And perhaps most thoughtful of all, 1% of the asking price goes to charity.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More TCG Accessories From Quiver Time: </h3><h2 data-cy="title2" id="bulk-collections">2. GameGenic Dungeon 1100</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best for Bulk Collections</h3><div id="197209" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gamegenic Dungeon Deck Box 1100+</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>The Dungeon is ideal for housing a complete card collection and good for accessories too.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve got a bigger collection of cards and want a solid and well-designed stackable box to keep them in, then look no further. Each GameGenic Dungeon can hold a thousand double-sleeved cards, or a few more if you’re happy to box them up “naked”. There’s a middle divider to keep them better organized and make it easier to search through your collection when you need to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lid goes on via a convenient magnetic mechanism which makes it simple to pop on and off but holds strongly and securely when not in use. It also allows for complete removal, making it simple to access all your cards. There’s room above the cards to keep a game board, rules or accessories, and it’s a stylish solution with a smooth exterior and a soft microfibre lining to cushion your cards.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="portability">3. Quiver Time Bolt Card Case</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Case for Portability</h3><div id="197216" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Quiver Time The Bolt Card Case</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>With its roomy interior, handy dividers &amp; 2 carrying straps, the Bolt Card Case gives an easy way to organize &amp; transport your cards. Also comes with 100 Apollo transparent sleeves, sized for all standard game &amp; sports cards.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While Quivers are fantastic all-round cases, they’re a little on the bulky side if you carry your cards around a lot. If you’re just after a case to take out to clubs and tournaments then they make a smaller option, the Bolt, for that very purpose. It holds a little more than half the capacity of its bigger sibling, but that also means it has half the weight and size.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In all other respects, it offers the same high quality build and styling of the Quiver, meaning your cards are just as well-packed and protected, only on a smaller scale. And you still get a free pack of card sleeves and 1% of the price to a children's orphan-based charity as well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="binder">4. VaultX Exo-Tech Zip Binder</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Binder</h3><div id="197217" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Exo-Tec® Exo-Tec® Binder</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>This Exo-Tec® binder is designed to fit a variety of cards and is compatible with all standard card protector sleeves, including Vault X Card Sleeves.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Boxes are not always the best option for storing your cards, not least because it’s difficult to flip through your collection and find the cards you need. Binders make a great alternative: although they hold fewer cards, they fit nicely onto shelves or cupboards and most options contain transparent pages with pockets into which to tuck your cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This binder from VaultX not only contains 20 such pages that hold 9 cards each, but boasts a protective padded cover and heavy-duty zip to keep your cards safe and secure. The standard version is standard black, but it comes in a variety of colors, sizes, and closures, so you can be sure to find one that fits your needs.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="protection">5. Casematix Graded Card Storage Box</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Protection</h3><div id="197218" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>CASEMATIX CASEMATIX Graded Card Storage Box</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>This heavy-duty card carrying case features a hard shell plastic exterior to prevent valuable trading cards from being crushed.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on how valuable your cards are and where you take them, you might feel the need to have a super-secure option to keep them safe. And they don’t come much safer than this Casematix case, with extra-durable hard shell exterior and customisable foam inserts that you can tear to ensure a perfect fit for your most prized cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case closes with a secure mechanism that also ensures its waterproof and airtight for maximum protection. And if that’s not enough for you, it’s designed to take cards in their own protective plastic slabs and there’s also a padlock ring so you can lock things down even tighter with added layers of your own security.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="deck-box">6. VaultX Exo-Tech Side Loading Deck Box</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Deck Box</h3><div id="197219" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Exo-Tec® Exo-Tec® Side Loading Deck Box</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Comes in several color options! Holds 100 double-sleeved cards, or 120 single-sleeved cards, or 210 un-sleeved cards.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Often, it’s fine to keep your cards in whatever container or case you can rustle up at home, but what you really want is a small, sturdy, premium-build box that you can use when taking a single deck of your precious cards out and about to play. Many brands have starter packs that come with suitable deck boxes for free, but they’re often flimsy cardboard affairs, so it’s better to invest in something a bit more durable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter this excellent option from VaultX. It’s available in a variety of stylish single-color finished, made of water-resistant microfibre. The lid doesn’t clip or slide on and off, as is common, but is held in place with strong magnets, making opening and closing super convenient. And the lid also flips round and magnetizes to the bottom of the box, tidying it out of the way and offering a stable platform to access your cards. You can also mix and match lids and boxes of different colors if so desired.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="budget">7. Fageverld Trading Card Storage Box </h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Budget Option</h3><div id="197220" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fageverld Fageverld Cardboard Storage Box</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Each Box holds about 620 standard 20pt trading cards and contains 2 packs of 10 dividers each to help sort your trading card or sports card.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For all the fancy protective cases you can buy for trading cards, fundamentally all you actually need for them is a box of some kind. And a box can be as basic as a piece of packaging that came with some other order: four sides and a lid will keep your cards in order just as well as a golden chest. There’s no need to spend a fortune if you don’t want the style and features offered by premium brands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that doesn’t mean there’s not something to be gained by spending at least a little on a storage option. Rather than a discarded cardboard box, you could get a specialized option like this. It’s sized just right to protect trading cards, comes with some dividers to keep things organized and has a top-loading lid so it’s easy to peruse your cards. Multiples will also stack neatly on your shelves to keep your cards together. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">How to Pick the Right Storage Option for You</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyone who has been a collector over the years knows binders may be the easiest and most convenient way to store cards, but can harm the cards over time. So, if you have any high-value cards or potentially high-value cards, it’s recommended to store them in sleeves or penny sleeves and put them in top loaders or boxes versus binders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on your budget, size of your collection, and value of your cards, you can start with a convenient option like a D-Ring binder, and work your way up from there. Based on the categories listed in the product options above, we're confident you'll find something affordable to get you started. What you choose will be based on many factors. For example, you may collect or play with Pokémon TCG cards and you just want to turn a stack of cards into an organized storage solution like using a cute, simple <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokmon-card-binder">Pokémon card binder.</a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tip: look for 'Acid-Free' and 'Soft-Backed' in the descriptions while shopping around. Also, consider your preference on matte versus glossy pocket pages. According to a recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/xzkphi/should_i_buy_classicglossy_or_matte_sleeves_for/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit poll</a> on the subject, the majority of votes landed on glossy sleeves based on pros and cons of visibility, shuffling, quality and texture. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">What is the Rarest Trading Card in History?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Guinness World Records, the title of 'world's rarest trading card' is tied between the 1996 World Champion and MTG's Shichifukujin Dragon cards, in which only one specimen of each card exists.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Storage Recommendations</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re a collector or gamer in organization mode currently (it seems like you might be!), you may want to browse our other storage and display guides.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-moba-shooter-deadlock-cuts-a-lane-spurring-reactions-from-its-playerbase<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">One less line of minions.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>, the MOBA-meets-hero shooter mash-up from Valve, has been in a perpetual state of quiet build-up over the last year. But that hasn't stopped Valve from making massive, tectonic changes, like cutting down the number of lanes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, February 25, Valve published <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1422450/view/530965072572320687" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Map Rework Update for Deadlock</a>. Chief among the changes was a redesign of Deadlock's core map around three lanes, rather than four. For those who don't dabble in MOBAs, these "lanes" are the central focus of gameplay; minions spawn at each team's base and surge down them, attempting to push the battle lines into each other's territory. Players take up residence in the lanes, fighting over the killing blow on minions to accrue money and experience they can use to power up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's one big game of tug-of-war, and reducing the number of figurative ropes from four to three has pretty drastic implications. It cuts down on one source of resources and reduces the number of fronts in the ongoing battle. It also means, for the 6-on-6 battles of Deadlock, that previously "solo" lanes will more often be duo lanes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Definitely going to be missing four lanes," one commenter <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1iy6ysk/map_rework_update/mes5m1t/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said on the Deadlock subreddit</a>. "I always thought that was one of the more unique aspects of Deadlock. Oh well, learn and adapt I guess."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite some of the worried hyperbole over map shifts, there is a degree of trust — though not absolute or unflinching — and voicing measured feedback. "It’s just a test guys chill," said <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1iy78c1/lane_changes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one commenter</a>. "If it works well it stays, if it doesn’t work then it will go away like mid urn." (A former game mechanic.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A decent amount of this trust stems from the fact that IceFrog, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/13/valve-announces-dota-2">pseudonymous developer behind Dota 2</a>, is also working on Deadlock. Dota 2 is fairly infamous for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-aftermath-of-dota-2s-game-changing-update-ign-arena-podcast">massive overhauls and game-changing updates</a>, wiith patch notes that felt like getting whiplash from spreadsheets. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1iyk163/some_of_yall_didnt_play_dota_and_it_shows/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Old memes stretching back to the early days of Dota 2</a>, encouraging players to trust in IceFrog's changes, have already been resurfaced for modern Deadlock players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Dota 2 has seen so many massive overhauls and changes and the game still thrives," a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1iyk163/some_of_yall_didnt_play_dota_and_it_shows/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commenter said</a>. "As long as Deadlock's core gameplay doesn't drastically change (which definitely isn't a guarantee since its currently in development) then people will play the game regardless."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Map changes aside, Valve took the wrench to a lot of Deadlock with this recent update. Soul Orbs, which are released from enemies upon death and can be shot by players to either secure their rewards or partially deny them from the enemy team, also got a hefty rework. Sprinting has been tuned, flex slots and economic considerations have been made to adjust for the new three-lane set-up, and there's the usual slew of quality-of-life and hero changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some, especially the long-time Dota players, Deadlock's update feels par for the course. (Dota 2 even <a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/737004388447420792" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">got its own massive overhaul just last week</a>.) While it will certainly shift the way players approach the game, part of the long-term appeal of a MOBA like Deadlock is the ways the game shifts over time, in response to both developer changes and community reactions. If handled well, it can result in years of vibrant competition. If not, well, hopefully there's a rewind button somewhere. History has shown that not all major updates are made in stone, even for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-is-looking-at-bringing-6v6-back-to-overwatch-but-it-wont-be-easy">huge games like Overwatch</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With not even a week out yet in Deadlock, players will need to dig in and figure out just how the reduced lanes shifts the game, suss out the intended change, and find new ways to open up gameplay through it. On at least one positive note, players with solo lane anxiety can breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deadlock is still flagged as being in early development, and Valve warns players it's filled with "temporary art and experimental gameplay." Access is currently limited to friend invite via playtesters, and there's no release window announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

All three titles will be available to download for Essential, Extra, and Premium members starting March 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a notably strong month for PlayStation Plus subscribers of all tiers, but the main highlight here is EA and BioWare’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard"><u>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u></a>. The big-budget RPG launched October 31, only four months ago, and received strong reviews from critics (we gave it a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review"><u>9/10 in our review</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-failed-to-resonate-with-a-broad-audience-gamers-increasingly-want-shared-world-features"><u>EA said</u></a> the latest Dragon Age title wasn’t able to “resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market,” and BioWare saw a restructure and layoffs.

This remaster of one of the more beloved entries in the Sonic franchise launched in 2021, adding more content to blaze through as players refamiliarized themselves with the Blue Blur’s sci-fi-inspired abilities and story. We gave it an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-colors-ultimate-review"><u>8/10 in our review</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out the pack is a collection of 13 remasters of Konami’s classic TMNT spinoff games. It’s a bundle that includes new and improved versions of beat ‘em up titles like TMNT: Turtles in Time, the original TMNT arcade game, and more, all under one roof. Although it wasn’t without its issues, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection"><u>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</u></a> still provides PlayStation Plus subscribers with an easy way to experience old-school fan favorites.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection is a treasure trove of Turtle games, but our online experience was barely functional when matchmaking,” we said in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-the-cowabunga-collection-review"><u>7/10 review</u></a>. “Couch co-op fares a lot better, but some may notice an increased input delay over the originals. All said this is still a great collection for fans.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation Plus subscribers can add Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Sonic Colors: Ultimate, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection from next week until April 1, 2025.

Platinum will join the GOG Preservation Program</a> by next month, and may also be the first of more Monolith games to hit the program.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The inflential 2005 first-person shooter is getting moved up on GOG's timeline for the Preservation Program to "properly recognize Monolith's contributions to gaming." <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Preservation Program</a> is GOG's initiative to keep classic games playable on modern systems, maintaining the titles in DRM-free form and with dedicated tech support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GOG has previously featured everything from Heroes of Might and Magic 3: Complete, to the original Resident Evil trilogy, to I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. It's an eclectic spotlight of games preserved in playable form, available on GOG's storefront, and F.E.A.R. Platinum — which includes the base F.E.A.R. and both expansions — will soon join the lineup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may not be the last Monolith game there, either. GOG said that other Monolith icons will "join eventually as well." The storefront also teased more news to come about the Preservation Program tomorrow, February 27.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The preservation effort is a nice recognition of Monolith Productions' legacy in the wake of its sudden closure. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier broke the news yesterday that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-cancels-wonder-woman-game-closes-three-studios">Warner Bros. had canceled its planned Wonder Woman game and shuttered three studios</a>: Monolith, Player First Games, and WB San Diego.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros.' games division has been in a difficult spot for some time. While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-review-harry-potter-ps5-xbox-pc">Hogwarts Legacy</a> chalked up a commercial win for the publisher, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-spurs-double-digit-drop-in-wb-gaming-revenue">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League spurred a double-digit decline in revenue</a>, and the financial failure of Smash-alike <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-to-shut-down-when-season-5-concludes-in-may">MultiVersus</a> piled on the misery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-is-leaving-the-company-a-year-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disastrous-launch">David Haddad is set to leave the company</a> after 12 years of helming Warner Bros. Games, and the <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-wb-discovery-looking-to-sell-off-games-other-divisions-to-prevent-total-breakup" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">division is rumored to be considered for-sale</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monolith had a legacy dating back decades, with games like Blood, Condemned: Criminal Origins, No One Lives Forever, and The Matrix Online on its resume. Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor became an instant hit, spurred on by its inventive "Nemesis System," which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-warner-bros-shut-down-shadow-of-mordor-developer-monolith-and-canceled-wonder-woman-fans-lament-the-wasted-potential-of-its-nemesis-system">Warner Bros. held in a vice-grip with its patent</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Monolith may be closed, it's nice to see other companies acknowledge the effect one studio has had on the medium. Hopefully we see more of Monolith's classics preserved for years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-gallery-card-seemingly-teases-hellfire-gala-theme-and-characters-for-season-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Keen-eyed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals"><u>Marvel Rivals</u></a> players have spotted an in-game reference that seems to suggest that Season 2’s theme and characters will revolve around the classic Marvel comics storyline, the Hellfire Gala.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Information on what NetEase Games could be planning for its next seasonal content drop was first spotted and shared <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1iy4eu3/season_2_is_hellfire_gala_confirmed_in_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>by Reddit user DynamiteDynamo10</u></a>. Their post includes a screenshot of the "Plans Within Plans" Gallery Card included in the in-game event page in Season 1, containing dialog and story details tied to the current season. It’s a lengthy entry in what is already a game brimming with lore, but what’s interesting is how it ends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now, if you will excuse me, Doom has a gala to attend,” the post concludes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not exactly an all-out reveal that Season 2 will follow a story set around Marvel’s well-known gala event, but it is at least a suspicious mention that you’ll need to dig to find. Meanwhile, other players are using Doctor Doom’s gala reference as fuel to the fire that are the rumors that X-Men regular Emma Frost will soon join Marvel Rivals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seemingly leaked Emma Frost voice lines were <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1893535638214922567" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>shared online by X0XLeak</u></a> this past weekend, kicking off speculation that the diamond-skinned character could be added sooner rather than later. She also happens to play a part in the original Hellfire Gala storyline along with a laundry list of other Marvel icons. Voice lines like this are suspicious on their own, so coupled with the reference to the gala, these details have some players already plotting out how Emma Frost could break apart the current Marvel Rivals meta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the development makes sense for many, others are saying the reference isn’t enough to confirm which Marvel names will join the Marvel Rivals roster in Season 2. If the next content drop, which is expected to arrive mid-April, is truly set to add content themed around the Hellfire Gala, then the Gallery Card is the first time NetEase has said anything official on the matter. So, even if we assume Season 2 centers around the Hellfire Gala, the story could include Emma Frost or go a different path completely.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, so many other players have spent the entirety of Marvel Rivals Season 1’s vampire-themed romp expecting to see Blade join as the next playable character following multiple in-game appearances. Some have suggested that this could mean we see the Daywalker join for one half of the season while Emma joins in another, while others theorize that Emma may not join until Season 3. At the least, NetEase has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-promises-a-new-hero-every-month-and-a-half">it plans to deliver at least one new character every half-season</a>, so Season 2 is sure to surprise players one way or another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these details are based purely on speculation; we won’t know what NetEase has planned for at least another few weeks. Until the team has more to share about the future of Marvel Rivals, you can check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-just-made-a-classic-moon-knight-meme-feel-a-little-more-real">how it chose to include a reference to an infamous Moon Knight meme</a> as part of its mid-season update.
