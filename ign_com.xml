You get promo cards and an oversized collectible card too. Trying to track down Lost Origin, Astral Radiance, or Brilliant Stars booster packs without paying inflated prices is bloody impossible as Pokémania 2025 rolls on. Single packs from these sets can now cost £5 to £10 each, especially for the more popular expansions. That’s where Pokémon V Boxes come in.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-hisuian-electrode-v-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Hisuian Electrode V Box">Pokémon TCG: Hisuian Electrode V Box</h2></p><div catalogid="4555a9a2-1c57-4482-8294-a8856d2fd769" id="216815"><div id="216815" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Hisuian Electrode V Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Hisuian Electrode V Box is available for £19.53 and includes two Lost Origin packs, one Astral Radiance pack, and one Brilliant Stars pack.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-virizion-v-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Virizion V Box">Pokémon TCG: Virizion V Box</h2></p><div catalogid="4555a9a2-1c57-4482-8294-a8856d2fd769" id="216816"><div id="216816" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Virizion V Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Virizion V Box is available for £19.99 and includes two Lost Origin packs, one Astral Radiance pack, and one Fusion Strike pack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">V Boxes are an underrated way to get booster packs at retail prices .

It includes two Lost Origin packs along with Astral Radiance and Brilliant Stars, two sets loaded with Trainer Gallery hits. Considering individual packs can run you £6 or more on eBay, this is an easy win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Want Lost Origin packs but don’t mind swapping out Brilliant Stars for Fusion Strike? Virizion V Box is another bargain. Fusion Strike has some strong chase cards, including Gengar VMAX and Espeon VMAX Alt-Art, so it's well worth ripping open. Lost Origin’s Giratina V, Astral Radiance’s Origin Forme Dialga, or Brilliant Stars’ Charizard VSTAR are all solid reasons to grab these V boxes before they sell out or go out of print. Both aren't far off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

It normally runs in the $30 range, but Amazon currently has it <a href="https://zdcs.link/QV73Mg?object_uuid=34e68c00-b671-4171-b832-c4c21420886d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on sale for $12.99</a>, which is less than half price. That's quite a deal on a game that's worth a look.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Maps of Misterra on Sale for $12.99</h2><div catalogid="8d6eada7-04f8-4e1d-8a7e-221edc573a17" id="216791"><div id="216791" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Maps of Misterra</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In Maps of Misterra, players are cartographers, seeking to chart an unknown island. You’ll start with some end-game goals of what you think the island is supposed to look like, and initially you’ll place terrain tiles on a shared board trying to match that map. But exploration is a tricky business and you can be mistaken: other players can overwrite your placements with their own until someone takes an extra action to confirm that tile, fixing it in place. Terrain effects, such as being able to see further atop mountains, or travel further over steppe, lend extra weight to the strategy and flavor to the theme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The result of this clever, two-step, discover and confirm mechanic is a fascinating dynamic and interactive puzzle where your goals push and pull against those of other players, and the island takes shape around them. This also provides a real sense of revelation, of venturing into the unknown as every version of the island is different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you enjoy getting into the theme of a game, you can also have a great time loudly proclaiming that your suggestions are the absolute truth against the nonsense other players are trying to foist on the map. It’s fun as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a>, too, against an automated opponent so you still get the sense of playing against an active player. The slightly messy interaction might put off some players, but at this price it’s worth a look for its sheer oddness.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">See more cool board games</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance writer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.
