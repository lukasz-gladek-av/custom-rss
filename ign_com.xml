            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">So far it feels like this anime arena fighter's combat and story mode were made in different rooms.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Editor's Note: This initial review in progress is based only on the PlayStation 5 version so far, with the PC version </em><a href="https://x.com/BLEACH_game_en/status/1903117822466855006" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>experiencing launch issues</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Bleach is the flashiest member of the shonen anime “big three,” standing shoulder to shoulder with mega popular series like One Piece and Naruto, it has long suffered from middle child syndrome when it comes to arena fighter adaptations. Bleach Rebirth of Souls aims to break the cycle of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-deserves-more-than-run-of-the-mill-arena-fighters"><u>run-of-the-mill anime fighters</u></a> this series has previously been part of, delivering a unique action game that attempts to raise the genre to greater heights. Even though I still have a lot left to play before my final review, having only spent 10 hours with it since I received review code just before the Ultimate Edition went live yesterday, it's evident that developer Tamsoft has a deep respect for the anime. Every detail of its crisp character models is meticulously crafted, and the combat feels like it's been lifted straight out of the show, with a depth that begs to be explored. However, the story mode, where I’ve spent most of my time so far, plays like a laughable attempt at a visual novel that was hobbled together as a last-second afterthought.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bleach Rebirth of Souls opens with a tutorial that puts its best foot forward – its combat. It’s easy to get overloaded with a bunch of confusing anime jargon as it explains how its health bar, counters, and super moves work, but here’s the quick way to understand things: This is a 3D arena fighter with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/06/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review">Super Smash Bros.</a>’s life stock system, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/21/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review">Sekiro</a>’s stance-breaking swordplay, and Bleach’s unique visual flair. Unlike other arena fighters, which often have combat so shallow you only need to find a single combo or spam super moves to win matches, Bleach's combat feels like a challenging game of tug-of-war – one where victories are clinched rather than mindlessly stomped out of opponents.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Bleach Rebirth of Souls Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each sword swing feels snappy and weighty as you teleport around the screen, ambushing your enemies from behind and breaking their guard. It never gets old to see large blocks of text wrap around freeze-framed characters with every successfully landed counter and super move. Even when you play Rebirth of Souls on its Standard Mode button layout, which streamlines things by letting you dish out flashy auto combos, it still harbors complex and unique mechanics specific to each character that warrant further exploration. That could be Uryu's long-ranged bow attacks  or Yoruichi's in-your-face brawler style. Variety like that is important as I both decide on a main and try to understand how to defeat different characters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a massive fan of the anime and manga's stunning artistry, stirring character development, and shocking plot twists, I had high hopes that Rebirth of Souls could deliver a worthwhile story mode. Sadly, I’ve been disappointed big time. By and large, cutscenes in an anime fighter should act as a sparkly reward at the end of battle, meant to bring the momentum of a fight to a thrilling climax. Cutscenes in the story modes of Naruto and Dragon Ball Z’s games are sometimes so well animated that they could serve as a substitute for watching the actual shows. That is not the case with Bleach. If anything, they nearly bring things to a screeching and embarrassing halt. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The look of its combat may have a lot of tender love and care put into it, but the story moments between that action instead play out like a cheap visual novel. Outside of a few pre-rendered cutscenes, the SparkNotes version of the anime this story mode attempts to tell is a rushed, hobbled mess. Instead of being greeted by bombastic scenes where my favorite characters clash, I was met with Machinima-looking animations where in-game models would fart out energy waves at each other and stiffly fall to the ground. Even the emotionally heady scenes lose all sense of tension as its characters move around like clumsy action figures with limited points of articulation in bright, low-poly arenas. What's more, exciting moments like sword clashes and beam struggles lose all of their gravitas as these scenes incessantly cut to black with bright slashes on the screen that look less like a creative choice for dramatic effect and more like a placeholder for an animation that wasn’t added in time. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat's vibrant sword slashes feel at odds with the unevenly crafted cutscenes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If this was a genuine attempt to resemble a visual novel, it definitely missed the mark, as it feels more like an unfinished first draft – and with review codes arriving so close to launch, it’s hard not to see this as an intentional hope that fans will buy-in based solely on the goodwill of the franchise. Which is a shame, because both its English and Japanese voice cast are putting in work with their vocal performances and the character models are faithful recreations that do look great in action. As if Bandai Namco took pointers from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhndpv7sEqE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Invincible season 2’s joke</u></a> about how animators cut corners to make more scenes, Rebirth of Souls put all of its focus on the fights, and every moment outside of them looks like a fan-made animators first crack at recreating the anime as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But although the story mode has yet to wow me in the 10 hours I’ve spent with it so far, there’s still more to play with — namely, the online and offline versus mode — before I can settle on a final verdict. As it stands right now, Bleach Rebirth of Souls’ combat goes above and beyond a run-of-the-mill anime arena fighter, with a dense battle system and tons of love put into making each of its characters feel unique. That makes it all the more disappointing that its crisp character models, vibrant sword slashes, and stylish typography accompanying each super move feel wholly at odds with the animation in its unevenly crafted cutscenes. Instead of making me want to play through the anime’s sprawling story myself, it's only encouraged me to revisit the source material so that the emotional climaxes actually land. But despite not delivering on that lofty promise, I’m keen to see if the versus modes will pick up the slack as I work toward my final review.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-assassins-creed-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-games-in-order">Assassin's Creed series</a> has had us globetrotting through history since its debut in 2007. From Renaissance Italy to Ancient Greece, Ubisoft's open world series has explored a wonderful variety of locations and settings, ensuring each conspiracy-packed game is a (semi) educational window into the past. Such an approach has made the series unique among its genre stablemates, which tend to whisk us away to fantasy lands or sprawling modern-day metropolises. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the bones of Assassin's Creed have mostly remained the same across its 14 mainline entries, the series has undergone a lot of changes over the years, including new takes on player progression and ever-expanding worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But which Assassin's Creed games are the best of the bunch? It's a tough question. After much deliberation (and only a handful of arguments), though, we’ve eventually agreed on the top 10 mainline entries in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, without further ado, here are our top 10 Assassin’s Creed games.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Assassin's Creed Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Playing the latest game in the series? Check out our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/assassins-creed-shadows"><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows guide</em></a><em>. </em></p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Assassin's Creed: Revelations</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2011/06/06/assassins-creed-revelations-20110606095314825-3464823.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-revelations">Assassin’s Creed: Revelations</a> wrapped up Altair Ibn-La-Ahad and Ezio Auditore’s stories, and, despite some unremarkable additions like the Den Defense mode, it was a memorable and thrilling send off. From flying down ziplines in Constantinople to hanging out with Leonardo Da Vinci, Revelations was packed full of fascinating adventures. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ezio and Altair’s final chapter was, in a way, both a sign of things to come and a celebration of what came before. Not only did we get one final fling with these two after seeing them grow and learn from lives full of adventure, but we had a chance to say goodbye to the first era of Assassin’s Creed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Assassin's Creed Syndicate</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/09/24/acssc63previewsasylumzipline1443101428jpg-9b2cc6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin’s Creed games are often as defined by their locations as they are their protagonists, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-syndicate">Assassin's Creed Syndicate</a>’s 19th Century Victorian London in the throes of industrialization may be the most memorable of the bunch. Sneaking around factories, racing horse-drawn carriages down the street, and even fighting Jack the Ripper all ground Syndicate in a setting that, while still fantastical, feels real.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Contributing to this sense of place is the string-heavy score from Journey composer Austin Wintory that doesn’t sound like anything else in the series before or after: dueling protagonists Jacob and Evie Fry even have their own soundtracks. It’s a small touch, but it’s one in a string of small touches that makes Syndicate’s world cohesive. Also, it’s hard to recall any game this side of Bloodborne that lets you fight this effectively with a cane.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Assassin's Creed Valhalla</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/12/01/assassinscreedvalhallafinalcontent-blog-1669914922538.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> didn’t reinvent the wheel like Origins did, but it did make some pretty substantial changes. Combat is weightier and more impactful than ever before; traditional side quests have been replaced by world events, making exploration and discovery much more organic; and the absurd amount of loot you’d have to organize and sift through was toned down substantially, making rewards feel much more valuable on the whole.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eivor might not be our favorite of the Assassin’s Creed protagonists, but her (or his) story is an engaging one, and is one of the best blendings of historical fantasy and mythology that the series has ever seen. Fans of Norse mythology are treated with a feast; not only do the sagas play a major role within the main campaign, but an entire game-length expansion set in the world of Thor and Odin practically turns Valhalla into a cousin of God of War. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/13/ss-c79ca0fa59bedea20c24e2ac0c2735e7ce2f3ae6-1920x1080-1739442669756.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-brotherhood">Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood</a> continues the story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, cementing him as a fan-favorite protagonist for the series. It trades the diverse locations of Assassin’s Creed 2 for an expanded version of Rome and its surrounding countryside and builds on the new mechanics introduced in Assassins Creed 2 – swimming, property management, firearms, and recruitable allies. This chapter of Ezio’s story is filled with charm, wit, and drama, and, thanks to its updated combat, we got to be the aggressive combat assassin we all wanted to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also the first game in the series to introduce multiplayer, allowing players to step into the shoes of the Templars to see who among their friends truly was the best assassin or hunter. It may not have advanced the formula as much as its predecessor, but it’s still cherished by many as one of the very best. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Assassin's Creed Origins</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/13/ss-1a0ab42e93e51c48ad9a6bda7f408958e09a43b0-1920x1080-1739443042212.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Origins marked a turning point in the series. It was the game that turned Assassin’s Creed from a stealth-focused action-adventure, into a straight-up open world RPG with a size and scope rivaled only by very few games. But even setting the historical significance of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin’s Creed Origins</a> aside, it’s important to note that it’s also just a damn good Assassin’s Creed game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its central story involving Bayek and Aya, who initially set out to find justice for their murdered son and ultimately wind up founding the order that would eventually become the Assassin’s Brotherhood, is extremely compelling; the world of ancient Egypt is a marvel to explore; and while many facets of its mechanics were improved in later games, the shift to loot-based progression and a more action <a href="https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-rpgs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPG</a> style of combat was just the kind of shot in the arm that the series needed to reinvigorate it in the eyes of fans.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Assassin's Creed Unity</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/06/09/acuscreencombatsworde31406094pmpst1402143761jpg-b685a9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After the tipsy sway of Black Flag’s pirate protagonist Edward Kenway, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin’s Creed Unity</a> was a return to the tone of original Assassin’s Creed. As the first AC game to be exclusively released on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 (alongside PC of course), Assassin’s Creed Unity was a graphical powerhouse for its time, boasting enormous crowds of NPCs walking through the streets of a near 1:1 accurate recreation of Paris. Even today, it’s still remarkably handsome to look at.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, Unity’s launch was a bit of a bumpy ride. A cavalcade of bugs, glitches, and an intensely overburdened map meant it was quickly written off by many. However, in the years since it has (thanks to several patches) blossomed into a firm favourite among Assassin’s Creed fans. Its enhanced movement system resulted in arguably the most fluid and elegant parkour the series has ever seen, which in turn allowed for excellent hit-and-run tactics. Its main assassination missions are also a series highpoint, offering a multitude of ways to infiltrate locations and bury your blade deep in a target’s neck. And frankly, seeing Notre Dame in all its glory makes AC Unity well worth the price of admission.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Assassin's Creed Shadows</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/19/acs-1742375176700.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Feudal Japan is the most-requested setting for an Assassin’s Creed game of all time, and so Ubisoft faced towering expectations when it finally decided to visit the Sengoku period. Thankfully, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> was exactly what the series needed; it brings the focus back to assassinations, putting increased emphasis on stealth and infiltration. And while still expansive, the open world and RPG elements are more restrained than those in Odyssey and Valhalla, resulting in a tighter, more balanced experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the first time since Syndicate, Shadows features two playable protagonists. Naoe’s toolkit is rooted in stealth, while Yasuke is a brutal fighter who captures the period’s samurai fantasy. While Shadows is best experienced from a mix of both perspectives, taking control of Naoe and making use of her grappling hook and climbing abilities allows you the full freedom to explore what is undoubtedly the series’ most astonishing world, complete with landscapes that dynamically change with the shifting of the seasons. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Assassin's Creed Odyssey</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/13/ss-16fc551879ac299dca68839da90f89d9e624db48-1920x1080-1739442948351.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassins’ Creed Odyssey</a> takes Origins’ combat style and new-found focus on role-playing, adds some extra ingredients to the mix, then sets it all against the sprawling backdrop of Ancient Greece, aflame with the war between Athens and Sparta. It’s an enormous, vibrant game, with some of the most stunning vistas we’ve seen in the series; both at land and sea (naval warfare returns here, and it’s wonderful). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new spin on Assassin’s Creed’s notoriety system sees you hunted across these environments, in a series of cat-and-mouse chases that are the most tense in any Assassin’s Creed to date, while the nation struggle system sees you fighting large scale battles in the name of Athens or Sparta. It’s also got a relatively compelling story for a game that can take 60-odd hours to beat, with some eccentric sidequests, fronted by a genuinely charismatic protagonist - whether you play as a male or female. Even after you finish Odyssey, there’s still so much to plunder and discover, and it’s a delight to simply exist in its world.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Assassin's Creed 2</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/13/ss-d3967a58038cc5e59332bb0043ab1ca343112bc6-1920x1080-1739442866992.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In many ways, we have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-ii">Assassin’s Creed 2</a> to thank for not only proving the formula works but for also giving us the defining analogy of a video game sequel fulfilling the promise of its underwhelming original. Though later entries would add even more depth, ACII made assassination missions more dynamic, with increased flexibility in how you approached objectives, more options for hiding or causing distractions, better combat, and better mobility with the ability to actually swim. New catacomb missions let players put their parkour skills to the test, the upgradeable homebase villa gave players a reason to keep investing in picking up collectibles and coins, and new weapons and gear from everyone’s favorite video game character, Leonardo da Vinci, kept gameplay fresh. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these changes were also connected to a beautifully realized Italian Renaissance era that introduced an all-time protagonist, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, and meaningful additions to the current-day story that brought the two time periods together in the wildest way possible. I mean, you fistfight the pope only to have an otherworldly deity speak through Ezio to Desmond in the present day. It was an unforgettable ending to an entry that proved how incredible Assassin’s Creed could be. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2013/12/10/ac4bfdlc12500x1400jpg-885d49.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After a long run of assassin protagonists, Black Flag tried something different, introducing us to a main character who was a pirate first, and an assassin second - and the ensuing adventure thrived because of it. It introduced a massively entertaining sandbox playground in the Caribbean, featuring a plethora of islands teeming with treasure and activities to embark upon - and an upgrade system that made the idea of hunting wild animals and harpooning something other than a chore. Instead of relegating the idea of sailing as means to an end, it built upon the framework of Assassin’s Creed 3’s naval combat to make nautical adventures the shining point of Black Flag. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it was hunting hapless merchant ships or bracing against some of the toughest buccaneers ever to sail the seas, attacking other ships cemented itself as something too good to pass up any time one floated by on screen. Aided by its impressive seamless transition from land to sea, it allowed the freedom of choice for players to either sail circles around enemy ships while blasting them to pieces, or ramming head on to leap onto the enemy ship, before unloading a brace of pistols like a whirling dervish. Not only did <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-black-flag">Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag</a> cement itself as one of the greatest in the series, it has easily become one of the greatest pirate games to immerse yourself in as well.</p><div id="every-assassins-creed-game-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Assassin's Creed Game Tier List</h3><h3>Every Assassin's Creed Game Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>You may also like: The </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-games-like-assassins-creed"><em>Best Games Like Assassin's Creed</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there you have it!
