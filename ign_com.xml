            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A multiversal first look at five different versions of the famous webslinger.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in March we got to reveal Magic: The Gathering's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-magic-the-gathering-crossover-reveal-card-spoilers">very first Spider-man cards</a> as part of a special Scene Box outside of the main set. Well today, as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-san-diego-comic-con-2025">San Diego Comic-Con 2025,</a> we're back with an exclusive look at some of the first cards that will actually be a part of that Standard-legal set – and this cast of five spideys will surely look familiar to any <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse">Spider-Verse</a> fans out there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flip through the slideshow below to see all five Spider-Man cards</strong>, as well as an alternate comic book art style for the titular webslinger himself.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering x Spider-Man - First Look at 5 New Cards</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering developer Wizards of the Coast <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-magic-the-gathering-crossover-reveal-card-spoilers">previously told IGN</a> that it wasn't limiting this set to a single comic run, and that's made quite clear with this early look. All five cards are different versions of Spider-Man depicted as legendary creatures: at Uncommon you have Spider-Man Noir and the robotic SP//dr piloted by Peni Parker, at Rare are Spider-Man 2099 and the delightfully goofy Spider-Ham, and finally at Mythic Rare is the man himself, Peter Parker, who flips over to become the Amazing Spider-Man.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last card is especially interesting as it is double-sided. The front is simply Peter Parker, while the back is his Amazing Spider-Man alter ego, and you have some flexibility in how to cast him. Magic has had what are called "modal double-faced cards" before that allow you to cast either side from your hand, but this is the first I know of that <em>also</em> allows you to pay a cost to flip it while the front side is already in play - in this case, you can play Peter Parker for two mana, and then pay four more on a later turn to have him transform. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you do, you get access to his very flavorful ability called web-slinging, which allows you to pay just three mana to cast Legendary spells if you also return a tapped creature to your hand. This card is sure to be a popular leader in Magic's most popular format, Commander, as it will let you cheat all sorts of big and expensive legendary creatures into play far earlier than expected. And because this card will also be legal across Magic's regular competitive formats, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lci/185/ghalta-stampede-tyrant" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">giant dinosaurs</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/120/valgavoth-terror-eater" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">terrifying demons</a> alike could be swinging onto the table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the cast here is a clear nod to Sony's excellent Into the Spider-Verse animated films, only missing a take on Peter B. Parker and Spider-Gwen to complete the first movie's main cast (though there's plenty of time for those to potentially be revealed themselves before the set launches in September). But before you get too excited, this was almost definitely just a nod to their reveal as part of this year's Comic-Con, as these cards and this set in general are not actually tied to that series in any direct way. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel's Spider-Man x Magic: The Gathering - First Card and Packaging Reveal</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And while we may not have a second version of Peter to show here, we do have an alternate art treatment for this one – one that is sure to excite any comic book fans out there. This secondary version shows off what's called the "Iconic Moments" Booster Fun treatment for this set, and all of the cards that use it will feature art from the pages of Spider-Man's adventures. This first one is taken straight from the cover of 1963's The Amazing Spider-Man #1, complete with artist credits for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prolific-marvel-creator-jack-kirby-honored-by-new-york-city-with-two-streets-named-for-him">Jack Kirby</a> and Steve Ditko. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you happen to be in the San Diego area yourself, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/magic.wizards.com/post/3lu6j5n5puv2g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wizards of the Coast is hosting a Spider-Man event</a> at the Hard Rock Hotel where fans will be able to go hands-on with the set's Welcome Decks – smaller preconstructed decks themed around Spider-man that are meant to be an intro point for new players as they learn the ropes.

It was the fastest-selling expansion in Magic: The Gathering history, per Hasbro. Its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-secret-lair">Secret Lair collaboration drops sold out in record time</a>, and while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-where-to-buy-in-stock">stocks of the boosters, starter kits, and decks have improved</a>, there was a period there where it was difficult to get your hands on anything Magic x Final Fantasy-related. The set's popularity even pushed a bunch of non-Final Fantasy cards to higher prices, just <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-cards-spike-thanks-to-new-final-fantasy-synergies">because of their excellent synergy with the set</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And on top of all that, it apparently earned $200 million in a single day - the same amount that Magic's Lord of the Rings set earned in <em>six months.</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Hasbro in its Q2 earnings call</a>, which revealed the figure alongside a report that Magic: The Gathering revenue grew 23% year-over-year in large part thanks to the Final Fantasy release.  Per CEO Chris Cox, it brought in more new players in stores over two weeks than any other set has in 12 weeks. And in the investor Q&amp;A during the earnings call, Cox answered a question about how Final Fantasy's demand correlated to the company's expectations with the following quote (<a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-hasbro-beats-q2-2025-estimates-but-stock-dips-93CH-4148568" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">courtesy of Investing.com's transcript</a>):</p><blockquote>In terms of Final Fantasy and how it met expectations, I’ll give you a comparison between two of our biggest universe at the onsets. Lord of the Rings took six months to deliver $200,000,000 of revenue.</blockquote><blockquote>Final Fantasy took one day. And we left demand on the table. So we couldn’t produce enough. I think we increased production runs on it four times pre release. It was substantially, by many, many very high double digit percentages, ahead of any other production run we’ve ever done.</blockquote><blockquote>And we left the market wanting more. And our expectation is there’s going to be a nice long tail of backlist for the product. Likewise, we’re still selling Lord of the Rings product today. So, even though we hit $200,000,000 in December ’2 for Lord of the Rings, We sold a substantial percentage of that in the several years following. We expect Final Fantasy to be no different.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s partially what’s powering our backlist, which already in five and a half months in the year did more than we’ve ever done in any year prior. So, I think that’s a little bit on what our bullishness is on Final Fantasy. What drove success for it? I think it’s a couple of things. I think first and foremost, it’s finding the right IPs that are great adjacencies to what Magic fans might appeal to or what Magic might appeal to another fan base.</blockquote><blockquote>Lord of the Rings was fantastic because it’s kind of the granddaddy of fantasy. It invented the genre, major books, major movies, major animation and games. Final Fantasy, I think, is almost as strong as Lord of the Rings in terms of IP strength, if not stronger in some regions. I think it has stronger cross regional appeal, and it has probably more of a sweet spot in gaming than Lord of the Rings has, because it was kind of born from gaming. So, I think potentially the overlap of fan bases was stronger than you might have even seen for something like Lord of the Rings.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In a follow-up question, Cox also noted that he feels "pretty good" about future collaborations and first-party sets coming next year "in terms of being Final Fantasy like in terms of the types of players, the size of community, and the adjacencies we have." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last remark bodes well for fans of the Final Fantasy set. We just saw a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-magic-the-gathering-crossover-spoilers-secret-lair">Sonic: The Hedgehog Secret Lair crossover</a> debut, and already know about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-magic-the-gathering-crossover-reveal-card-spoilers">Spider-Man</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-aang-magic-the-gathering-cards-reveal-early-look-at-upcoming-the-last-airbender-set">Avatar: The Last Airbender themed sets in September</a> and November, respectively, so with success like this, more crossovers are likely to make sense to the folks at Hasbro. In the meantime, at least this means Hasbro will keep the Final Fantasy cards stocked for a good while, for those who haven't been able to get their hands on them yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

These are games that pit players against one another as heroes and villains, and those that let you work together to stop some dastardly villains.

One of the things that sets Sentinels apart is how the game also factors in the environment, with each environment also coming with its own deck and effects that further expand the game's replayability. To keep things manageable, players will only have to worry about their own hero's deck, with the "game" handling the villain and environment decks.

For fans of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aeons-end-board-game-buying-guide">Aeon's End</a>, this game will feel familiar, as it is a reimplementation of that game's systems.</p></div><p id="hellboy-the-board-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Hellboy: The Board Game">Hellboy: The Board Game</h2></p><div catalogid="6f356180-4c85-45aa-b073-38137310f203" id="225744"><div id="225744" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hellboy: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hellboy: The Board Game is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">dungeon-crawling</a> adventure where you and your friends move detailed minis of members of the BRPD like Hellboy, Abe Sapien, or Roger, as you work to solve different cases, taking down any bosses and enemies that get in your way. Each playable character comes with a set of skills and attacks that are unique to them, which you will need to use if you have any hope of succeeding in the game's included scenarios. Besides simply navigating around the modular board that you set up before each game, players also need to adjust on the fly as the Deck of Doom throws wrenches in your way at every turn, helping keep things exciting. This game can be played both as one-off sessions or as a strung-together campaign, and with a bunch of expansions released, there is plenty of Hellboy goodness out there for fans of the Dark Horse Comics series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.
