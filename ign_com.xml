            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Scarlet and Violet prices are taking off</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet and Violet base set prices have been anything but steady lately, with some Illustration Rares climbing fast while SIRs cool off just as quickly. I’ve been tracking a handful of cards that stood out this month, with some pulling in surprising gains and others dropping harder than expected. Here’s a quick look at which Pokémon TCG cards are crashing and climbing ahead of the final Scarlet and Violet sets release in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed">Black Bolt and White Flare</a>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/14/pixel-9-55-1752506840543.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been keeping an eye on Scarlet and Violet base set prices lately, and the Psychic-type Illustration Rares seem to be the ones pulling ahead. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXBEO?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ralts 211/198</a> has been quietly climbing. It's sitting around $38.99 now, which is up about 28% this month. For a Basic card with simple art and a single Psyshot attack, that's not something I saw coming. Same goes for <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yDxGw?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kirlia 212/198</a>. It's up to $27.99, mirroring Ralts's percentage jump. That evolution line seems to be gaining popularity as a set, more than just individual play value.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of evolutions, <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpW7v?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gardevoir ex 245/198</a> is definitely riding that same wave. It’s hit $54.99 recently, up from $41.19 just a month back. I don’t play Gardevoir myself, but the Psychic Embrace ability keeps showing up in deck lists, so the price hike makes sense when you look at both collector and competitive demand feeding into each other. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObrgE?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Miraidon ex 244/198</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3Gr1m?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koraidon ex 247/198</a> are seeing their own upticks, both sitting around $23.99 now. Not massive jumps compared to Gardevoir, but steady enough to notice if you’ve been following these since launch. Miraidon especially, thanks to that Tandem Unit ability, looks like it’s still holding value in Lightning-heavy builds.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/14/pixel-9-53-1752506866583.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other end of things, some cards are definitely cooling off. <a href="https://zdcs.link/a03015?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fidough 213/198</a> took a 15% hit, now hovering around $13.74. Cute card, but it doesn’t exactly have a standout ability or attack, so this feels more like a natural correction. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXB57?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Armarouge 203/198</a> dipped too, though only about 11%. I could see it regaining some ground later if Fire decks make a comeback, but for now, it’s sliding. <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEg28J?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pachirisu 208/198</a>’s price drop caught my attention more, which is currently down 19%. I feel like that’s tied to Lightning deck meta shifting around; its no-Paralysis ability isn’t moving the needle price-wise anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/znxNBq?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dondozo 207/198</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpW8r?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Starly 221/198</a> both saw the sharpest drops, each now at $9.99. Dondozo lost 30% this month, and Starly even more at 37%. I never really saw much hype for either of these beyond early Scarlet and Violet excitement, so the fall-off doesn’t surprise me. It feels like folks are figuring out what’s actually playable or collectible long-term.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Mega Evolution Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is it, the beggining of a new expansion for Pokémon TCG. Best Buy have gone live with their preorder allocation for Mega Evolutions today, which mean Target and Walmart won't be far behind. Here's all the links you need and good luck trainers!</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Price Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't believe I'm writing this, but Amazon has quite a bit of sealed Pokémon TCG product for under market value. Whilst that unfortunately means it's still way above MSRP, some of these sets are at the best prices they've been in the last month.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Last Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As newer Pokémon TCG sets grab the spotlight, Paradox Rift is seeing its high-rarity SIR ex cards drop in value while several Illustration Rares quietly climb due to shifting collector interest and low inventory. Cards like Altaria ex, Gholdengo ex, and Steelix have dropped between 16% and 25%, while Illustration Rares including Morpeko, Plusle, Minun, Groudon, and Iron Valiant ex are climbing fast, with Morpeko leading at a 43% increase. This mirrors earlier trends where less flashy cards gain traction as availability tightens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon's Prime Day sale this year was pretty good overall for casual board game and puzzle enthusiasts. There were discounts on quite a few popular games and many <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">popular jigsaw puzzle brands</a> had all-time low prices. But if you happened to have miss all of those deals, Woot is currently having a small sale of its own that gives you a second chance at savings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There aren't a ton of options in this sale, but there are enough to make it noteworthy. Some of the best deals available here are on 3D puzzles and some lesser known board games, so I'd suggest checking those out first. The popular<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-awesome-board-game-and-lego-mash-up-is-steeply-discounted-for-prime-day"> LEGO board game that was on sale during Prime Day</a> was also included, but has already sold out.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Puzzles and Board Games on Sale Today</h2><div catalogid="94d95da3-c3b8-4ab3-9937-c0c55f9b6dd3" id="225302"><div id="225302" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>See All Puzzle and Board Game Deals</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Woot has a landing page for all of the discounts currently offered in its sale, and I recommend you just peruse it yourself to see if there's anything of interest to you. Like I mentioned above, there aren't <em>that</em> many things available in this sale. The board game side of the discounts are especially lacking in some of our favorite options, but there are still some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family games</a> worth picking up in here. The overall best deals are on 3D puzzle builds that are collaborations with popular franchises like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Marvel, and Star Wars. These types of puzzles are excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-alternatives">LEGO alternatives</a> that were already fairly affordable before getting extra discounted here.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What is Woot?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you aren't familiar with Woot, the easiest way to learn more about it is through the <a href="https://www.woot.com/about" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about page on its website</a>. In a nutshell, Woot is a daily deals site that was founded back in 2004 and later purchased by Amazon. They offer deals on just about everything that many other retailers don't often have. The products themselves are always high-quality and backed by Amazon, so it's legit. Prime members even get free standard shipping on anything they buy on Woot, so you don't need to worry about hitting a minimum price or total shipping costs if you already have Prime.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 14, 2025 4:41 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/woot-is-having-a-post-prime-day-sale-on-puzzles-and-board-games]]></content:encoded>
