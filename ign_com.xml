            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A collectible statue apparently due for release alongside the unannounced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> remake has popped up online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft is yet to make its Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake official, but the game's arrival has long been expected <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-confirms-multiple-assassins-creed-remakes-are-on-the-way">following a constant series of leaks</a>. Now, fans have seemingly gotten a first look at merchandise for the game, in the shape of a new statue designed by collectible maker Pure Arts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lavish design features Black Flag hero Edward Kenway sat on a treasure chest that's spilling gold coins, leaning back against his ship's wheel, a cutlass and pistol in each hand. The statue is then topped off by a large billowing flag featuring the game's logo: the Assassin's Creed sigil with a skull in the middle.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="fr" dir="ltr"><p>⚠️ LEAK BLACK FLAG REMAKE ?</p><p>Un gars sur Vinted vend une toute nouvelle figurine de Edward Kenway et prétend qu'elle sortirait cette année. </p><p>En sachant que le remake de Black Flag était censé sortir dans moins de 2 mois, serait-ce la figurine officielle du jeu ? <a href="https://t.co/ctVWiavA6c" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ctVWiavA6c</a></p></div>— j0nathan (@xj0nathan) <a href="https://twitter.com/xj0nathan/status/2016167642046849488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 27, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">If Ubisoft has made any change to Kenway's character design for its remake, there's no evidence of it here. That said, any alteration to the now-iconic pirate assassin's look would have been a surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What is curious, though, is how this statue has seemingly come to light. Unboxed and with no mention of its origins, the item was reportedly listed via used clothing resale app Vinted. Numerous fans spotted the item pop up, including notorious Assassin's Creed leaker <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/2016167642046849488" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">j0nathon</a>, who quickly realized this was not a statue that had been publicly released already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The item's listing states that it is 35cm tall and features a 20cm width, and due for release in 2026. A detailed close-up of the statue's base shows logos for Ubisoft and Pure Arts, with a copyright mark registered for 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-swirl-as-collectible-maker-admits-there-is-something-going-on">Pure Arts hinted it had something in the works for Black Flag</a>, and suggested this would surface in the not-too-distant future as "there is something going on." Reports detailing the remake have  since suggested that the game has gone through substantial changes to modernize its visuals and gear system in line with more recent franchise instalments. Another report has also claimed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stop-removing-the-modern-day-assassins-creed-fans-react-as-black-flag-remake-reportedly-cuts-everything-outside-the-animus">the game will also no longer feature any content outside the Animus</a>, with extra pirate missions added instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most notable confirmation of the project came from Edward Kenway's own voice actor, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-edward-kenway-actor-alleges-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-for-hinting-at-black-flag-remake">initially teased the project</a> before later suggesting he'd been told by Ubisoft in no uncertain terms to stop talking. Finally, last month, the game popped up on the PEGI European ratings board website revealing what looks to be its final title: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft itself previously said it would release an unannounced game before the end of its current financial year on March 31, though this launch has now been delayed into the coming financial year (ending March 31, 2027) due to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure">company's major recent reshuffle of teams, projects and studios</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
