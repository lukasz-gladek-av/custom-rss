            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blade-ball-thanksgiving-event-ushers-in-the-holidays-with-festive-quests-and-activities<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox’s stylish dodgeball minigame, <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/13772394625/Blade-Ball" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blade Ball</a>, is cutting into Thanksgiving 2024 with a brand-new Thanksgiving Event that adds holiday-themed activities for players to feast on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The festive event arrived alongside a stuffed V6.4 update that originally made its way to players last weekend. Although the event itself kicked off a few days ago, there’s never been a better time to dive in and see what turkey-themed activities there are to enjoy.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/28/blade-ball-roblox-1732789550437.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Blade Ball brings Thanksgiving Event to Roblox players for two weeks.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox Blade Ball players can access the Thanksgiving Event themselves by keeping an eye out for the turkey NPC in the lobby. Those who manage to spot a turkey in their games can be granted Turkey Coins and unlock unique rewards. It’s an event filled with distractions to keep competitors busy with additional quests, daily rewards, a shop, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">V6.4 also introduces a few other changes to keep players bouncing back. Crown Clash, for example, is a game mode that can be voted for every five rounds and sees players trying to survive while carrying a crown for as long as possible. Win Streaks are another addition that will allow users to show off their win streak with a counter above their heads. Of course, developer Wiggity also introduced a few bug fixes and balance adjustments, including nerfs for Dragon Spirit and Phantom.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Blade Ball Thanksgiving Event started on November 23 and runs for two weeks. That means you’ve only got until December 7 to enjoy everything it has to offer.

It’s a Thanksgiving smorgasbord that will only continue to pile on, as new weapons are scheduled to be added every week for the next month and a half.

Players will find a new Energy Bundle in the shop, for example, with three new Wraps and six new Charms now available to obtain when completing specific challenges. Rivals fans will also find that the team has tweaked the Flamethrower, Revolver, Slingshot, and Grenade weapons to help make the overall experience more balanced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to various bug fixes and map changes, Nosniy promises to unveil even more content with a Winter update that is set to arrive in “just a few weeks.” The Massive Weapons Update patch notes also touch on the long-awaited Ranked Mode, saying that it has “evolved” and is now set to arrive as part of a larger update sometime in early 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to make sure Ranked is an amazing experience on release,” Nosniy explains, “but we've been backed up with these necessary holiday updates.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-black-friday-deals-on-thanksgiving-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I arrived here quite by accident—one moment I was in the year 1619, the next, standing amidst a cacophony of lights, an endless sea of goods, and this strange entity called IGN dot com. At first, I feared I had been ensnared by sorcery, but now I have access to something far more wondrous: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-black-friday-2024-deals">Black Friday shopping</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What is this curious holiday where people queue in droves to trade their coin for treasures I could scarcely dream of? As I learned of these deals and contraptions, I vowed to document my findings. For if you, too, were a time traveler, these are the marvels you'd surely wish to bring home—these marvels (the best Black Friday deals to shop on Thanksgiving, by the way) would astonish any soul, no matter the century.</p><p id="gaming-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Gaming Deals">Gaming Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I would keep up the whole 17th century pilgrim theme but I'm short on time and lacking in creativity after writing about Black Friday deals for a month! Anyway, here are the absolute doorbusting deals you should come to expect from a Black Friday sale, including some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-video-games-black-friday-deals">major discounts on top games</a> like Star Wars Outlaws, Sonic X Shadow Generations, Persona 3 Reload, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not satisfied? Fine, have a look through the best console deals for Thanksgiving as well. With discounts on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-playstation-console-deals-black-friday-2024">PS5 console bundles</a> (now down to just $375 for the digital edition), along some of the best ever discounts we've seen for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-best-black-friday-deals-2024">Nintendo Switch</a>. These bargains won't last forever, and some are even going out of stock as I write this (blast!). </p><p id="home-and-hearth-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Home and Hearth Deals">Home and Hearth Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Have you ever considered the modern miracle that is the Air Fryer? It's a wonder of science and feels very much like magic in a small to medium container. It can cook sausages, chicken, falafel, and pretty much anything you can think of. Expect oatmeal, don't try making oatmeal in your air fryer. </p><p id="apple-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple Deals">Apple Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever contraption you're eyeing, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-apple-deals-black-friday-2024">Black Friday Apple deals</a> are a good place to start. AirPod Pro (2nd Gen with USB-C) are <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7b3jy?object_uuid=a7ce8b62-e625-4ec6-93f1-5ef08543298b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D1XD1ZV3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on sale at Amazon</a> for $153.99 right now. I'd say it's safe to grab them if you're in the market, as that's the best price we've ever seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for standard AirPods, both Amazon and Target are offering a $10 off the new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-airpods-4-with-anc-review">4th gen AirPods with active noise cancellation</a> and the model without. I personally prefer the Pro model because the silicon ear tips work well for me, but some people don't like them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has just dropped prices across the board on various <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-ipads-early-black-friday-deals-2024">Apple iPad models for Black Friday</a>, including the the <a href="https://zdcs.link/NMoYd?object_uuid=a7ce8b62-e625-4ec6-93f1-5ef08543298b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">10th gen Apple iPad</a>, which is now down to $249.99 after you clip a $29.01 off coupon on the product page. This is the best price we've seen ever since it was launched back in 2022, and I am pretty certain it won't drop again for Black Friday.</p><p id="tech-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tech Deals">Tech Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay there's a few more excellent gaming deals rolled into one here, but you can't deny how excellent some of these offers are? Steam Deck on sale, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-meta-quest-3s-deal-2024-bonus-best-buy-target-gift-card">Meta Quest 3S with probably the best deal we've ever had on the VR headset</a>. I mean $75 <em>free </em>Amazon credit sounds a little too good to be true, but it's not! The deal is real and well worth picking up ASAP. Still hungry? Well go have some more turkey. I kid, or do I?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't. Check out even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-devices-echo-kindle-black-friday-2024">more great tech offers on Amazon devices</a>, perfect for improving your smart home experience in the short and long term. My favorite offer here? It's the Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $33, a new low of the streaming stick, which is also now Xbox Game Pass enabled. Get rolling, as these deals really are the cream of the crop this Thanksgiving. </p><p id="streaming-black-friday-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Streaming Black Friday Deals">Streaming Black Friday Deals</h2></p><div catalogid="08f6102b-d1c3-4715-b3e4-b7fe53fe7888" id="191844"><div id="191844" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hulu (Ad Plan)</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Get 12 months at $0.99 per month, offer ends December 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-x-terraria-coming-in-2025-december-update-set-to-add-huge-new-island<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair has teased a major update for the game coming in December as well as a crossover with Terraria.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking to the Palworld Discord, Pocketpair said the December update adds the “largest, harshest, and most mysterious” island yet to Palworld. This new island is about six times bigger than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Sakurajima:_New_Pals_and_How_to_Access">Sakurajima</a>, which hit Palworld in June.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Don't miss it!” Pocketpair teased alongisde the screenshots, below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld December 2024 Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Pocketpair teased a surprise crossover with indie smash hit Terraria. There are no details yet, but artwork, below, shows characters from both games clasping hands. Expect whatever this is to arrive in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this comes, of course, as Pocketpair works to defend itself in a high-profile patent lawsuit filed by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. After Palworld’s huge launch earlier this year on PC and Xbox, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have gone down the patent route. They want 5 million yen (approx $32,846) each plus late payment damages, as well as an injunction against Palworld that would block its release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-reveals-patents-at-the-heart-of-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-lawsuit-and-how-much-money-its-being-sued-for"><u>Pocketpair confirmed the three Japan-based patents</u></a>, which revolve around catching Pokémon in a virtual field, that it's being sued over. Palworld <em>does</em> include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, similar to the mechanic seen in the 2022 Nintendo Switch exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus"><u>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</u></a>. One of the three patents in question is about riding on top of Pokémon (Palworld also lets players ride Pals).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One patent expert has suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-may-end-up-getting-help-from-an-unlikely-source-in-its-nintendo-patent-lawsuit-an-8-year-old-gta-5-pokmon-mod">a GTA 5 mod dating back to 2016 may be recognized as a precedent by the court</a> because it included the catching Pokémon mechanic long before Pokémon Legends: Arceus. If that happens, it could work in Palworld’s favor.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/28/gduzmzzaoamf-7t-1732804325873.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Palworld gets a Terraria crossover at some point in 2025. Image credit Pocketpair.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC earlier this year, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, signing a deal with Sony to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patent experts have said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-lawsuit-shows-just-how-seriously-nintendo-views-the-threat-of-palworld-patent-expert-says"><u>Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s lawsuit against Pocketpair is evidence of the threat posed by Palworld</u></a>, which has since gone on to launch on PS5. Pocketpair has vowed to take on Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in court, saying: “We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The sheer number and quality of the deals outclasses the ones we found on Amazon, Walmart, or Target so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A big advantage you get for shopping at Best Buy over online-only retailers like Amazon is that you have the option of buying online and picking it up in store. Chances are there's a retail location within driving distance of your home. Not only do you avoid the hassle of shipping, especially during the busy holiday season, but returning your order can be a lot easier, especially on larger items like computers and TVs.</p><div catalogid="028a145e-5dc2-4e3c-a711-702c006350a6" id="211413"><div id="211413" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sony PlayStation 5 Slim Disc Console Fortnite Cobalt Star Console Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony released their entire set of Black Friday PlayStation deals last week and most major retailers have followed suit. The best deal is definitely on the consoles themselves: the PS5 Slim Disc Edition has dropped to $424.99 (originally $500) and the PS5 Slim Digital Edition has dropped to $374.99 (originally $450). I would choose the Disc Edition because it's only $50 more and then I have the option to buy (and later sell or trade) physical disc media. But if you want to save some money and go the Digital Edition route, I would suggest getting the NBA 2K25 bundle, which also includes a game. Although the Fortnite Cobalt Star bundle has a fancy looking box, no actual game is included.</p></div><p id="playstation-5"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="PlayStation 5">More Playstation Black Friday Deals</h3></p><div catalogid="56b24fb1-b74e-4b45-8835-20eee9ba9746" id="211427"><div id="211427" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Metaphor: ReFantazio</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://howl.link/fmaa2am0vzacr" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> was released on October 11, so it's nice to see a nice 29% off discount so soon after launch.

We rated it the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-soundbar">best soundbar of 2024</a>. This is a premium soundbar and it shows. This 45" soundbar houses 11 precisely engineered internal speakers, including two dedicated height channels. It's Dolby Atmos ready, and there's enough power here that you can probably get away without a subwoofer. However, the Sonos Arc can be wirelessly paired up with other Sonos speakers and subs to add even more sound distribution. The Arc also has a built-in microphone for voice control so it is Alexa and Google Assistant compatible.</p></div><p id="sonos-deals"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Sonos Deals">More Black Friday Sonos Deals</h3></p><h2 data-cy="title2">When Is Black Friday 2024?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re in the home stretch: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> falls on November 29 this year.
