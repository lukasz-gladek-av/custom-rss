            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A reliable leaker has revealed Sony's main PlayStation Plus Monthly offering for February, more than a week before it becomes available. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boxing game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/undisputed">Undisputed</a> will headline next month's lineup, according to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-voici-le-titre-phare-de-la-selection-de-fevrier-2026-60911" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dealabs</a>' billbil-kun, who says that the liscensed punchup title will be the month's main game available. So, while other titles are expected, Undisputed will be February's main addition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Undisputed is expected to become available on February 3, for PlayStation Plus subscribers across all tiers from Essential upwards. As ever, it should remain available for a month, until March 3. We'll follow up with February's other PlayStation Plus Monthly games whenever Sony announces them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">January's PlayStation Plus Monthly games are of course currently still available to claim, including Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, Core Keeper and Need for Speed Unbound.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally launched in October 2024 for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, Undisputed is notable for being the first major licensed boxing video game in over a decade, since the EA-published Fight Night Champion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Developer Steel City Interactive's approach to boxing in Undisputed is on the right track, but there's a long road ahead of it," IGN wrote in its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undisputed-review">Undisputed review</a>, which returned a 6/10 score. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Its emphasis on realism, preparing for fights using RPG-like mechanics, and creating an adrenaline-filled experience in the ring are significant building blocks. Still, the fluidity of its gameplay animations and reactiveness of its commentators don’t come close to living up to the high bar that was set by the Fight Night series back in the late 2000s, and its realistic fighting can be a little dull if you’re in the mood for a KO instead of a TKO."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-where-to-buy-2026">Lorwyn Eclipsed</a> now out, our attention will soon sharply be turning to the next Magic set of 2026, which is also the first "Universes Beyond" release of the year: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-where-to-buy-2026">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, if you’re already sold on meeting up with cardboard versions of the Heroes in a Half Shell, their friends, and their foes, then good news - Amazon is once <em>again</em> discounting booster boxes, which are <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8YwG?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>now down to their lowest ever price</u></a>. (And while we're at it, the retailer has also recently <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN3XYy?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">restocked preorders for the popular TMNT Draft Night Box, now listed for $119.99</a>).</p><div id="229417"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="229417" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>TMNT Booster Box (30 Packs)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now down to just $124.99, and containing 30 of your finest Play Boosters (each containing 14 cards), this is a certified $84.71 in savings compared to its original $209.70 list price. That's also just over $4 for each booster ($4.17, to be precise), which is more than a couple of bucks off what you’d usually pay when buying them individually. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In comparison, the market price for these is still sitting around <a href="https://zdcs.link/aA8lWq?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$139, according to data at the trusted resale marketplace TCGplayer</a>. While this will likely continue to drop (fallen 45.71% in the past three months), you're certainly ahead of the trend if you pick up the preorder at Amazon right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, just a heads up, as it's important for those looking to buy: Amazon doesn't charge until dispatch (so your card won't be charged until closer to release on March 6. Plus, the retailer also has a preorder price guarantee, so if it drops even further or somehow goes<em> back up </em>in price, you can be absolutely certain that you're paying the lowest price possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magics-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-set-is-months-away-but-play-boosters-are-discounted-already"><u>This is also even better than the deal we saw just before Christmas</u></a>, and now even lower than the next best price at Amazon from earlier this month ($148.20). Although it does make you think, is the discount indicative of Wizards of the Coast’s expectations for the set? Let's hope not!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December, the price dropped to $159.99, bringing the Universes Beyond box of Play Boosters to around the standard price of a Universes Within box, but dropping even further to just $125, this seems like a mighty good deal for what is already looking like a very popular set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We saw similar drops for <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrJe7m?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spider-Man</a>, which would be a little worrisome if <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qm8mKK?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Avatar</a> hadn’t got the same treatment - and that set was great.
