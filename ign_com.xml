One year removed from the infamous in-game liberation of Malevelon Creek, Helldivers 2 is sending its players back to the planet to hold it against surging Automaton forces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a recent Major Order failure, players were worried about a return to the Creek, as reports indicated the Automatons — pushing forward with their fiery new Incineration Corps — were targeting the Severin Sector. The sector, and Malevelon Creek in particular, was the center of one of Helldivers 2's earliest and most notable collective moments in the game. Helldivers converged on the planet to try and keep the Creek under Super Earth control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The combination of jungle terrain and extremely dangerous foes led to Malevelon Creek being dubbed things like "Robot Vietnam." After the fight concluded and the Creek was securely under Helldiver control, Arrowhead released a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-gives-all-players-a-special-commemorative-cape-for-malevelon-creek-memorial-day">special cape to commemorate the fight</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, over the weekend, a new Major Order confirmed Helldivers <em>will</em> be heading back to Malevelon Creek. The offensive, led by the Incineration Corps, is on its way, with Malevelon Creek as the target. Already, invasions and skirmishes are underway across the sector, with lines pushing towards the Creek.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through the in-game briefing, Super Earth is urging its Helldivers to protect the resting place of many "Creekers" who fell in the push to free the planet. This is all to prevent the "greatest net desecration" of the upcoming Malevelon Creek Memorial Day.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Helldivers Alerts (@HelldiversAlert) <a href="https://twitter.com/HelldiversAlert/status/1906316365507748312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 players are, predictably, amped for this Major Order.

Those who experienced the Creek back then, with its swarms of bots and lasers filling the air, are geared up for round two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New players who joined after the original fight for the Creek <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1jnguoi/wake_the_f_up_helldiver_we_got_a_creek_to_liberate/mkn0lse/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also seem eager</a> to jump in and experience this particularly memorable locale. There's a lot to be said for these communal efforts, where Helldivers start logging on and building towards big moments together. When it ties into the long-running story and a feeling of a shared experience in a universe, it can be really incredible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, concerns are already rising that Arrowhead hasn't fully tipped its hand yet. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1jnz8re/this_mo_is_going_well_too_well/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One post notes</a> that while the defensive efforts are going well and Malevelon Creek is currently safe, there are still five days left on the Major Order. Teams are <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1jnz8re/this_mo_is_going_well_too_well/mko9wui/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working to target specific goals</a> as the sector remains a hotbed for Automaton incursions. It's fascinating to see it unfold in real-time, and will no doubt make this week an exciting one for Helldivers players as the war for the Creek picks up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-is-having-its-halo-moment-with-the-dark-ages<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The last thing I expected Doom: The Dark Ages to remind me of was Halo 3. And yet, half way through a recent hands-on demo with id Software’s gothic prequel, I was mounted on the back of a cyborg dragon and unleashing a salvo of machinegun fire across the side of a demonic battle barge. With the vessel’s defensive turrets destroyed, I landed my beast atop the ship and proceeded to charge through its lower decks, turning the entire crew into a few gallons of red slop. Seconds later, the warmachine was toast and I burst through its hull, leaping onto my dragon to continue my crusade against the machines of Hell. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those familiar with Bungie’s landmark Xbox 360 shooter will instantly recognise the shape of Master Chief’s assault on the Covenant’s scarab tanks. The helicopter-like Hornet may have been swapped for a holographic-winged dragon and the giant laser-firing mech for an occult flying boat, but the core of the experience is all here: an aerial assault that transitions into a devastating boarding action. Surprisingly, this wasn’t the only moment in the demo that reminded me of Halo. While the combat core of The Dark Ages is unmistakably and singularly Doom, the campaign’s design seems to have a very “late-2000s shooter” spin thanks to its love of elaborate cutscenes and a greater push for gameplay novelty.    </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/28/doom-the-dark-ages-dragon-1743152759607.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A dragon assault on Hell's battle barge. | Image credit: id Software / Bethesda</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Across two and a half hours I played four levels of Doom: The Dark Ages. Only the first of them, the campaign’s opener, resembled the tightly paced, immaculately mapped design of Doom (2016) and its sequel. The others saw me piloting a colossal mech, flying the aforementioned dragon, and exploring a wide-open battlefield dotted with secrets and powerful minibosses. It’s a big departure from Doom’s usual pursuit of mechanical purity, instead feeling akin to the likes of Halo, Call of Duty, and – weirdly – old James Bond games like Nightfire, all of which thrive on scripted setpieces and novelty mechanics that guest star for a mission or two. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a fascinating direction for Doom to head in, because once upon a time the series made something of a U-turn away from this. The cancelled Doom 4 was set to resemble Call of Duty, not only due to its modern military aesthetic but also thanks to an increased emphasis on characters, cinematic storytelling, and scripted events. After years of work id Software concluded that such ideas simply weren’t a good fit for the series, scrapping them in favour of the much more focused Doom (2016). And yet, in 2025, here they are in The Dark Ages. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The campaign’s rapid pace is punctuated with new gameplay ideas that are reminiscent of Call of Duty’s biggest novelties.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo opened on a long and elaborate cutscene, (re)introducing the realm of Argent D'Nur, the opulent Maykrs, and the Night Sentinels – the knightly brothers-in-arms of the Doom Slayer. The big guy himself is depicted as a terrifying legend; a nuclear-level threat on two legs. While all of this lore will be familiar to Doom obsessives who poured over the prior games’ codex entries, the deeply cinematic approach with which it’s now presented feels very new. Very different. Very Halo. That continues into the levels themselves, with NPC Night Sentinels scattered about the environment akin to UNSC Marines. While they don’t fight alongside you (at least not in the levels I demoed) there’s certainly a greater sense that you’re part of an army – like Master Chief, you’re the invincible spearhead of a large force. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot of character work in the introductory cutscene and it remains to be seen if this is something Doom really needs. I’m a big fan of the prior games’ slight approach to story, and part of me would rather The Dark Ages continued to tell the Slayer’s tale through environment design and codex entries, reserving cinematics only for the big reveals à la Eternal. But while I have my reservations, the cutscenes thankfully know their place: they tee up a mission and are never seen again, refusing to interrupt Doom’s signature intense flow. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are interruptions in other forms, though. After that opening mission, which starts with pure shotgun slaughter and ends with you parrying Hell Knights using the Slayer’s incredible new shield, I was thrown into the cockpit of a Pacific Rim-like Atlan mech and asked to wrestle demonic kaiju. After that, I was soaring through the skies on that cybernetic dragon, taking down battle barges and picking off gun emplacements. These tightly scripted levels create a significant gear shift, punctuating the campaign’s rapid pace with new gameplay ideas that are reminiscent of Call of Duty’s biggest novelties, such as Modern Warfare’s AC-130 gunship sequence or Infinite Warfare’s dogfighting missions. The Atlan is slow and heavy, and the skyscraper-high perspective makes Hell’s armies look like Warhammer miniatures. The dragon, meanwhile, is fast and agile, and the shift to a wide-angle third-person camera results in a very different experience that feels a dimension away from classic Doom. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/28/doom-the-dark-ages-mech-1743152796190.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The mech battles are Pacific Rim-scale punch ups. | Image credit: id Software / Bethesda</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the best FPS campaigns thrive on this kind of variety. Half-Life 2 and Titanfall 2 are the gold standard for it. Halo has endured so long partly because its mix of vehicular and on-foot sequences provides it with a rich texture. But I’m unsure if this will work for Doom. As with Eternal, The Dark Ages is once again a wonderfully complex shooter to play – every second demands your complete attention as you weave together shots, shield tosses, parries, and brutal melee combos. In comparison, the mech and dragon sequences feel anemic, stripped back, and practically on-rails – their combat engagements so tightly controlled they almost resemble QTEs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Call of Duty the switch to driving a tank or firing from a circling gunship works because the mechanical complexity of such scripted sequences isn’t that far removed from the on-foot missions. But in The Dark Ages there’s a clear gulf between gameplay styles, so much so it’s akin to a middle school guitar student playing alongside Eddie Van Halen. And while I know Doom’s core combat will always be the star, when I’m beating the snot out of a giant demon with a rocket-powered mech punch I shouldn’t be wishing I was back on the ground using a “mere” double-barrelled shotgun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My final hour of play saw The Dark Ages shift into another unusual guise, but one built on what feels like a much sturdier foundation. “Siege” is a level that returns its focus to id’s best-in-class gunplay, but it opens up Doom’s typically claustrophobic level design into a huge open battlefield, its geography shifting between narrow and wide to provide a myriad of pathways and combat arenas. The goal, to destroy five Gore Portals, has the same energy as Call of Duty’s multi-objective, complete-in-any-order missions, but I was reminded once more of Halo – the grand scale of this map versus the tighter routes of the opening level evokes the contrast between Halo’s interior and exterior environments. And, like Halo, the novelty here is that the excellent core shooter systems are given new context in much larger spaces. You must rethink the effective range of every single weapon in your arsenal. Your charge attack is employed to close football field-length distances. And the shield is used to deflect artillery fired from oversized tank cannons. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Were these ideas always a bad idea for Doom, or were they just a bad idea when they looked too much like Call of Duty?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The downside of expanding Doom’s playspace is that things can become a little unfocused – I found myself backtracking and looping through empty pathways, which really does kill the pace. It’s here I’d like to have seen The Dark Ages veer even closer to Halo by throwing the dragon into the mix and using it like a Banshee; being able to fly across this battlefield, raining down fire before divebombing into a miniboss battle, would have helped maintain the pace and make the dragon feel more integral to the experience. If such a level exists beyond what I’ve seen, I’ll be very happy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of the overall shape of the full campaign, though, I am fascinated that so much of what I’ve seen feels like a resurrection and reinterpretation of ideas that were once considered an ill-fit for the series. Very little of the cancelled Doom 4 was released for the public to see, but a <a href="https://kotaku.com/five-years-and-nothing-to-show-how-doom-4-got-off-trac-468097062" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotaku report</a> from 2013 paints a distinct picture. “There were a lot of scripted set pieces,” a source told the publication, among them allegedly an “obligatory vehicle scene.” And that’s exactly what we’ve got in the Atlan and dragon sections – mechanically simple scripted sequences that hark back to the novelty vehicle levels of Xbox 360-era shooters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://youtu.be/PS6SBnccxMA?t=812" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talking to Noclip</a> in 2016, id Software’s Marty Stratton confirmed that Doom 4 “was much closer to something like [Call of Duty]. A lot more cinematic, a lot more story to it. A lot more characters around you that you are with throughout the course of the gameplay.” All that was scrapped, and so it’s genuinely fascinating to see so much of it return in The Dark Ages. This is a campaign set to feature big boarding action setpieces, lusciously rendered cinematics, a much wider cast of characters, and huge lore reveals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is: were those ideas always a bad idea for Doom, or were they just a bad idea when they looked too much like Call of Duty? Part of me is just as skeptical as the fans who once decried “Call of Doom”, but I’m also excited at the idea of id Software finally making that approach work by grafting it on to the now-proven modern Doom formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The beating, gory heart of The Dark Ages unquestionably remains its on-foot, gun-in-hand combat. Nothing in this demo suggested that it will not be centre stage, and everything I played affirms it's another fantastic reinvention of Doom’s core. I think that alone is strong enough to support an entire campaign, but id Software obviously has other designs. I’m surprised that a couple of the studio’s new ideas feel so mechanically slim, and I am concerned that they will feel more like contaminants than fresh air. But there’s still a lot more to see, and only in time will these fractured demo missions be contextualised. And so I eagerly await May 15th, not just to return to id’s unrivaled gunplay, but to satisfy my curiosity. Is Doom: The Dark Ages a good late-2000s FPS campaign or a messy one? </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/when-will-gta-6-trailer-2-come-out-take-two-boss-says-its-better-to-provide-marketing-materials-relatively-close-to-the-release-window<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It might be a while yet before we get Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 2, after comments from the boss of Rockstar’s parent company revealed his preference for releasing marketing materials relatively close to a release window.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-rockstar-officially-unveils-first-trailer-early-after-leak"><u>Rockstar released GTA 6 Trailer 1 to record-breaking viewership</u></a> in December 2023, but it hasn’t released a single asset since. The 15-month wait for more information has fueled increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories about when Rockstar will release GTA 6 Trailer 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These have included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/on-the-gta-6-trailers-1-year-anniversary-fans-are-debating-youtube-playlist-updates-and-batting-away-misleading-ai-generated-images"><u>counting the holes in Lucia’s cell door net</u></a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/were-now-at-the-bullet-holes-and-braille-stage-of-gta-6-fan-theory"><u>bullet holes in the car from Trailer 1</u></a>, and even registration plates. But chief among the conspiracy theories is GTA 6’s ongoing moon watch, which was, remarkably, proven to have accurately predicted the date Rockstar announced when it would release GTA 6 Trailer 1, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-community-devastated-by-gta-6-trailer-announcement-no-show-after-moon-theory-proved-incorrect"><u>debunked as a hint at the release date for Trailer 2</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the big question right now is, when <em>will</em> GTA 6 Trailer 2 be released? We’re no closer to finding out, but based on comments from Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick, fans may have to wait until much closer to GTA 6’s actual release date for their next look at the most anticipated video game in the world.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/0M53-LKlECk?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Zelnick was asked straight up: why is GTA 6’s release date such a carefully held secret?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I’ve ever seen for an entertainment property," Zelnick replied. "And I’ve been around the block a few times and I’ve been in every entertainment business there is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement. And we do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance. And we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation. We don’t always get it exactly right, but that’s what we are trying to do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few things worth digging into here. The first is Zelnick’s comments about keeping GTA 6’s release date such a carefully held secret “to maintain the anticipation and the excitement.” That’s something fans and the media alike have assumed to be true, and indeed former Rockstar developers have tried to explain is true.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Key Art's Hidden Map..?</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mike York, who worked as an animator at Rockstar New England for six years helping to build Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 before leaving the company in 2017, said on <a href="https://youtu.be/TnTIV8AFs2o?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>his YouTube channel</u></a> that Rockstar is playing up to the conspiracy theories, deliberately avoiding saying anything about the game or when Trailer 2 will be released in order to fuel even more speculation within the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They're reaching and pulling and trying to come up with these really cool theories to decipher when the next trailer will be,” he said of fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Specifically Rockstar, they're very secretive about what they do, and this is a really cool tactic because it creates allure and it creates mystery and it creates people talking about it without them having to do anything. The more they're silent the better it is, because the more people will be antsy and want to talk about it and have this feeling of not knowing what's going to happen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">York went on to say that Rockstar is likely resisting pressure from its army of fans to announce the GTA 6 Trailer 2 release date for this exact reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They could easily release the trailer date and be like, ‘Hey this is when the trailer's coming out,’ but they don't do it. And they don't do it on purpose because it's a really, really good marketing tactic. If you think about it, it creates these really cool theories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This brings the fans together. This is a really cool way to get fans to talk about your game when you’re not releasing anything yet, in-between the times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“All these theories are great. They only create hype, they create talk, they create mystery behind the games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second thing worth pulling out of Zelnick’s quote is the suggestion that GTA 6 Trailer 2 won’t be released until we’re closer to the game’s actual release date in fall 2025 (assuming it’s not delayed). If that’s true, it may be half a year before we get another look at GTA 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you wait for GTA 6 to come out, check out IGN’s coverage of an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, Take-Two boss Strauss <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6"><u>Zelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

More Than Just Pals, a dating sim set in its massively popular monster-catching universe — and no, it’s not an April Fools’ Day joke (this time).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team behind 2024’s Pokémon-like survival experience revealed its plans to inject a bit of romance into its catalog today, March 31. It’s an announcement that, on any other day of the year, fans would accept without question. However, April Fools’ Day gags, fake games, and more strange announcements from game developers will surely flood the internet as soon as the new month rolls in tomorrow, so most fans are already taking Palworld! More Than Just Pals with a grain of salt.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair wants to <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1906694803632644593" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>be clear for the non-believers</u></a>: Palworld! More Than Just Pals is indeed a real video game. The idea was seemingly born out of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep4kasLrZug&amp;t=2s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>its 2024 April Fools’ Day stunt</u></a>, which saw the team announcing More Than Just Pals as a fake game for little more than a quick laugh. Well, now it’s real, and it’s coming to PC via Steam at an unspecified point in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld! More Than Just Pals sounds like an especially out-there addition to Pocketpair’s popular universe. Its description teases an experience that allows players to befriend and fall in love with a cast of student Pals who attend Palagos Private Academy. The project’s official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3620480/Palworld_More_Than_Just_Pals/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam page</u></a> highlights characters like the “cute” and “mysterious” Katress and the “timid” Chillet, with many names pulled directly from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a>’s library of creatures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You, the protagonist, enroll as a transfer student in the prestigious Palagos Private Academy,” an official description from Pocketpair said. “You will meet unique friends (pals) and enjoy school life through friendship and romance. It's up to you whether you stay friends with the pals, develop romantic relationships with them, or even dismember and eat them.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">This doesn't concern April Fools :)</p>— Bucky | Palworld (@Bucky_cm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1906694803632644593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 31, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair’s Palworld celebrated its one-year anniversary this past January as it continues development with more updates. Its string of content will surely help with the wait for the Palworld dating sim, as players most recently got their hands on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-update-050-adds-crossplay-across-all-platforms-blueprint-upgrading-photo-mode-and-more"><u>an update that added</u></a> crossplay support, Blueprint upgrades, photo mode, and more.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-weve-played-it</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-weve-played-it.1149837/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-weve-played-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I went into my hands-on with Doom: The Dark Ages I was prepared for intense violence and high volume heavy metal, but what I didn’t count on was such an exhilarating amount of demon-killing variety. By the end of my two-hour demo I’d used a saw-toothed shield to slice through demons like it was Beelzebub’s Beyblade, stomped around a war-ravaged city as a colossal Mecha-Slayer, and even brought a snarling Cyberdemon to an explosive end by breathing fire directly down its throat with my faithful dragon steed – which seemed as though it had come to life from one of the sketches I used to draw in the margins of my high school maths books. In fact, every aspect of it looked and felt incredible. It may take place in the dark ages of the Doom timeline, but the Slayer’s latest slaughterfest might well represent the peak of the series’s modern era.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with the most crucial new change: the shield. While 2016’s Doom was focussed on run and gun, and 2020’s Doom Eternal evolved into jump and shoot, the core combat principle of Doom: The Dark Ages is to stand and fight. That’s not to say I wasn’t immediately strafing through the strife as I met each new wave of Satan’s soldiers, but the Doom Slayer’s new shield allowed me to hold my ground and block or parry enemy attacks, and even deflect projectiles back at them whenever I managed to nail the timing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to which enemy attacks can be deflected and which can’t, it’s basically traffic light rules – red means stop and green means go. Or for Star Wars fans, red is bad and green is good. The point is, you must constantly stay on the move to weave your way through the red waves of enemy fire, but the moment you see a green burst you need to dash towards the danger in order to perfectly bat back everything from searing bolts of energy fired by enemy archers to the deadly volleys launched by the hulking Hell Tanks.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Dark Ages’ shield makes the new Doom feel like the greatest unofficial Captain America game ever made.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It introduces a welcome new test of your timing and positioning on top of the already high intensity gunplay – which has also been revitalised by an awe-inspiring arsenal that includes a machine gun that crushes skulls and spits out shards of bone and just might be the most heavy metal weapon ever conceived – but the shield isn’t there simply to block and deflect. It can also bare the brunt of a powerful lunging bash that instantly closes the distance between you and your target, and you can even rev up its spinning saw-toothed edge like a chainsaw and hurl it. The shield will pinball through crowds of weaker enemies like the Imps, or it can be lodged straight into the sternums of the beefier Imp Walkers to stun-lock them in place while you mop up the lesser minions around them. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Doom: The Dark Ages - Preview Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Slayer’s shield can also work in tandem with your bulging bag of boomsticks in some incredibly satisfying ways. Come up against a platoon of soldiers marching behind seemingly impenetrable steel shields of their own? Just pump a few super shotgun rounds into their metal mobile cover to heat it until it’s visibly molten, before frisbeeing your shield straight at them to ignite the entire group and shower yourself in valuable armour pickups from the resulting explosion.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dark Ages’ shield is perhaps the most devastating interpretation of the phrase ‘the best offense is a good defense’, and it makes the new Doom feel like the greatest unofficial Captain America game ever made. Only, instead of fighting an army of Nazis you’re battling the most evil villains that Hell has to offer. Which, I suppose, are both one and the same.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At any rate, no sooner had I settled into The Dark Ages’ sensational new shield-wielding combat system, than I was suddenly whisked into the cockpit of a massive Mecha-Slayer to take on the tallest terrors to ever emerge from a Hell portal. The Atlan assault mechs have only been teased in the past couple of Doom games, but in The Dark Ages they’re finally pilotable, and I was absolutely thrilled to get behind the controls of one of these green-helmed goliaths in order to raise some hell. Or should I say, raze some hell, as I stomped out tiny tanks and crashed through bridges lined with troops on my way to going toe to towering toe with each Titan demon trying to take me down.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best of First-Person Shooter Campaigns</h3><p>It’s easy to immediately think of classic multiplayer matches and modes when thinking about the history of first-person shooters, but the genre is full of captivating campaigns and memorable stories.  From the far-reaches of the galaxy to the literal pits of hell – and everywhere</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Doom: The Dark Ages takes the series’ signature ultra violence and literally elevates it into Kaiju-sized carnage. Its Atlan combat is simple in setup but seriously satisfying in execution, as you repeatedly pump the right trigger to unleash combos with a pair of school bus-sized fists, with each successful blow you land filling up a special meter consisting of two halves. Fill it halfway and you can deliver a powerful stomp that sends a shockwave through the earth below and opens up cracks of damaging lava that stagger your opponent. Fill it completely and you can deal a devastating finishing move to force Lucifer’s leviathans to go in peace. Or more specifically, in freshly shredded pieces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like your 50-storey-tall fisticuffs with a side order of gargantuan guns then fear not, because midway through the level a whopper of a weapon drop gave my mech access to a machine gun so large it could use an aeroplane hanger for a holster. Performing perfect dodges on incoming enemy attacks powers up both barrels of this not-so-mini-gun, and I was soon blasting gloriously gory chunks of flesh off each Titan’s torso that showered on the soldiers below. You don’t normally see this much raining blood without buying a ticket to a Slayer concert and sticking around for the encore.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You don’t normally see this much raining blood without buying a ticket to a Slayer concert and sticking around for the encore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately I was only given the smallest taste of these supersized shootouts, since my hands-on quickly switched tracks from Godzilla to Game of Thrones as I slipped out of the Atlan’s cockpit and into the saddle of a cybernetic dragon, complete with twin cannons and a pair of dazzling laser wings. Soaring through the skies above a humungous holy city, I took the fight to a series of Hell Carrier airships, again performing perfect dodges to power up my attacks to demolish the artillery along their sides and the deadly assault cannons atop their hulls. With each airship’s defenses down, I was then able to swoop down to its exposed landing zone, leap off my dragon to briefly blast through Hades’ hordes on the flight deck, before shield-bashing into its central power core and forcing the whole thing to erupt like a Hellspawned Hindenburg, as I flew to safety aboard my scaly skybound steed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both the Atlan and cyberdragon sections proved to be propulsive palette cleansers rich with spectacle, but I was itchin’ for more of that bitchin’ shield and shoot ’em up action. Thankfully the Slayer was soon brought back down to earth to unleash further terror on terra firma as my hands-on finished with a taste of one of Doom: The Dark Ages’ sprawling sandbox levels. While the previous gameplay stretches were dynamic but somewhat directed action set pieces, this bumper battlefield level dubbed The Siege gave me the freedom to tackle its objectives in any order and progress through it entirely at my own pace.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thus, in between exhilarating encounters with waves of heavily armoured Mancubuses and shield-based slugfests with super heavy Cyberdemons, I was also able to scour the landscape in all directions for gold to spend on weapon upgrades, collectible toys, and even brand new guns to add to my growing arsenal of demon-destroyers. This included the Reaver Chainshot, which delivered powerful charged up attacks that basically allowed me to fire a cannon ball to instantly mulch a monster, before retracting it on a chain and firing it again to crush their minion mate beside them. Kind of like a Chain Chomp but not nearly as adorable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The expanded map also provided plenty of nooks and crannies to hunt through for health and armour pickups, including melee ammo for the Slayer’s new flail and electrified gauntlet attacks. That’s right, as if the Slayer wasn’t already badarse enough, he now manually reloads his punches like he’s Henry Cavill in the bathroom brawl scene from Mission: Impossible - Fallout. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The overall impression I got from The Dark Ages’ Siege map is that, although it’s large in size, it’s still dense with breathtaking discoveries and diverse encounters. Some open-field fights locked mini-bosses behind a morale meter, keeping them immune to my attacks until I’d hustled to take out a few dozen of their underlings. Other caves I explored featured almost no combat at all, instead challenging me to use my shield for environmental puzzle-solving, either as a grappling hook to launch me to otherwise unreachable areas or a tool to manipulate the controls of a variety of arcane machines. There were wonderful surprises almost everywhere I looked, but also some not so wonderful ones… like the giant tentacle that suddenly emerged from the ground beneath my feet in a swamp area and turned me from unstoppable beast to recently deceased in an instant.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that, my time in the Slayer’s combat boots was up, and what a brief but utterly brilliant ride it had been. If this small taste is anything to go by, then I'm pretty sure that the only reason id Software is calling this one Doom: The Dark Ages is because the title of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-ultimate-doom">The Ultimate Doom</a> was already taken three decades ago. From its satisfying shield-based combat shake-up and enticing sandbox level structures, to its Pacific Rim-rocking skyscraper-sized beatdowns and its dazzling dragon-riding dogfights, the team behind Doom: The Dark Ages is seemingly throwing everything but Hell’s kitchen sink into making this the biggest and best campaign seen to date in the seminal shooter series.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Doom: The Dark Ages seems to have the flexibility to allow any level of player to become a god tier Slayer.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also set to be the most accessible. If you’ve ever wanted in on the wanton demon destruction but have previously been too intimidated to try, Doom: The Dark Ages looks to have you covered. Not only is there an expanded number of difficulty settings to choose from this time, with six different levels of challenge from the exceedingly gentle Aspiring Slayer to the absolutely mental Ultra Nightmare, but there are also tools to tweak almost every aspect of the experience. That includes sliders to adjust everything from parry timing windows to the damage dealt from each attack, and the overall speed of the action. Whether you want it to be a friction-free power trip or a synapse-straining punishment, Doom: The Dark Ages seems to have the flexibility to allow any level of player to become a god tier Slayer. What’s more, since it’s a prequel to the 2016 reboot, you can go in completely fresh even if you have NFI what a BFG is. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom: The Dark Ages is set to arrive on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on May 15th. Until then, if you want a daily dose of doom, you could just spend a few minutes scrolling through social media. But if you want more Doom: The Dark Ages, be sure to check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/doom-the-dark-ages-developers-discuss-the-future-of-doom">interview with the team at id Software</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/doom-the-dark-ages-gameplay-overview-xbox-developer-direct-2025">gameplay overview trailer</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tristan Ogilvie is a Senior Video Producer at IGN's Sydney office.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-exclusive-ghost-of-ytei-gets-new-story-info-commits-to-2025-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">We haven’t heard much about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> in recent months, but after fans spotted a morsel of new story information published to the game’s website, they’re having fun speculating about how Sucker Punch’s hotly anticipated PlayStation 5 exclusive will actually play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official website</a> includes the following story snippet:</p><blockquote>300 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima, a new warrior – Atsu – rises from the ashes of her homestead.</blockquote><blockquote>Filled with fury and determination, Atsu will hunt down those responsible for the death of her family and exact her revenge. Every odd job and bounty will provide the coin she needs for her journey. But how she fights, survives, and evolves the legend of the Ghost, will be up to you.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">We already knew Ghost of Yōtei’s setting and the time period, and that Atsu was on a revenge mission of some kind. But what we didn’t know was that she’s hunting down those responsible for the death of her family after her homestead is destroyed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s the mention that “every odd job and bounty will provide the coin she needs for her journey. But how she fights, survives, and evolves the legend of the Ghost, will be up to you.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are speculating that Ghost of Yōtei will have a bounty hunting mechanic in which Atsu takes on jobs to earn money needed for other things in the game. There’s the potential here, then, for an actual in-game economy, where Tsushima didn’t really have any sort of money mechanic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If true, this may tap into Sucker Punch’s stated goal of giving players more control over Atsu's story. Creative director Jason Connell has said that one of the changes compared to Ghost of Tsushima will be a less repetitive open world: “One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the  repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again. We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ghost of Yotei</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, the website retreads old ground, mentioning new weapon types (ōdachi, kusarigama, and dual katanas), “massive sightlines that let you look far across the environment, skies of twinkling stars and auroras, and vegetation that sways believably in the wind,” and “enhanced performance and visuals on PlayStation 5 Pro.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s the crucial point: the website lists 2025 as the release window for Ghost of Yōtei. There’s been much talk about Sony maybe waiting for Rockstar to announce GTA 6’s release date so it can make sure Ghost of Yōtei doesn’t clash. GTA 6 is currently set for a vague fall 2025 launch, but some are wondering if parent company Take-Two will delay the game into the winter or potentially beyond. With that in mind, perhaps Ghost of Yōtei will release this summer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever the release date, it does feel like things may be ramping up for Ghost of Yōtei. Hopefully we'll hear and see more soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
