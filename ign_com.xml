            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo fans now know who developed Switch 2 launch title Welcome Tour — the mini-game collection that also acts as an interactive instruction manual for the new console, which many have suggested should have been included for free.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> doesn't state it within the game itself, Mario Party studio Nintendo Cube, formerly NDCube, has now updated its <a href="https://www.nintendo-cube.co.jp/works/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> to confirm the game is its work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Cube is a Tokyo-based subsidiary of Nintendo founded in 2000 that frequently handles the company's various mini-game collection projects. It developed the so-so Wii Party (not to be confused with the better Wii Play, which came with a packed-in Wii Remote), as well as the disappointing Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival on Wii U. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, Nintendo Cube released the functional Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics for Switch 1, before the infamous Everybody 1-2 Switch — a party game sequel launched with little fanfare that earned Nintendo some of its worst review scores in recent memory. ("Everybody 1-2-Switch might be the first party game I’ve played where I ended up with fewer friends afterwards," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everybody-1-2-switch-review">IGN wrote in its 4/10 appraisal</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's for Mario Party that Nintendo Cube is best known, having taken over as the hugely popular party game series' main developer beginning with 2012's Mario Party 9 onwards, and continuing with Mario Party 10, Mario Party Star Rush, Mario Party: The Top 100, Super Mario Party and Mario Party Superstars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Cube's next launch is (deep breath) Super Mario Party Jamboree: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV, a Switch 2 update for Super Mario Party Jamboree that makes use of the new console's mouse controls and optional camera peripheral, due to arrive on July 24.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While a budget-priced release, criticism was levelled at Welcome Tour for the sheer number of its mouse-control games, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-which-everyone-thinks-should-be-free-requires-95-of-accessories-and-a-4k-tv-for-100-completion">the need to have a camera peripheral, a Switch 2 Charging Grip or Pro Controller, and a 4K TV to see everything it had to offer</a>, and complete the game with gold medals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Even if Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour were the pack-in game it feels like it was meant to be, the execution of its charming concept is a muddled collection of quaint tech demos and boring factoids dressed up as an uncompelling completionist checklist," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-review">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

"A very sad day for one of the best car racing video games. I loved my time there."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Responding to a comment regarding Turn 10's future overall, Russell noted that "the studio is open to support the Horizon side" and that Microsoft had "shuttered the Forza Motorsport side only."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chris Harding, another former Turn 10 Studios employee, suggested that "120 people" were "gone from FM side." IGN has contacted Microsoft for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Turn 10 Studios' original Forza Motorsport launched for the OG Xbox in 2005, and established the series as one of Microsoft's core gaming brands, as well as a serious rival to PlayStation's Gran Turismo. Seven Forza Motorsport sequels have launched since, spread across every Xbox console generation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the series' original sim racing side has increasingly been eclipsed by the success of Forza Horizon, the franchise's newer, open-world spin-off that first launched on Xbox 360 in 2012. Following a positive reception, the following decade saw four Forza Horizon sequels follow. </p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-teases-return-of-halo-in-2026-and-its-reportedly-a-halo-combat-evolved-remaster">Xbox boss Phil Spencer recently confirmed that the next Forza title would arrive in 2026</a>, it was widely assumed that this meant a new entry in the Forza Horizon series, rather than a follow-up to 2023's most recent Forza Motorsport, which was set up as something of a series reboot but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-motorsport-players-frustrated-with-lacklustre-developer-statement-addressing-the-games-issues">launched to a mixed response</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Forza Motorsport is reportedly no more, with no one at Turn 10 Studios left currently working on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The legacy will stay," Russell concluded, "even if there is no future for the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A developer who worked on Microsoft's now-cancelled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled">Perfect Dark reboot</a> has addressed the claim that last year's gameplay demo was "fake," and said the glimpse was a vertical slice of the project running "in-engine."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perfect Dark was one of several projects canned by Microsoft this week as part of the company's latest devastating cuts to Xbox staff and games. Developed by The Initiative, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">a studio Microsoft is now shutting down</a>, alongside Tomb Raider studio Crystal Dynamics, Perfect Dark had rarely been glimpsed since its initial <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-perfect-dark-announced-from-the-initiative">announcement back in 2020</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That all changed last year when a "gameplay reveal" video aired as part of the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2024. And it's this video that has since sparked questions over how much of what it shows corresponds to actual, working game systems. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Kotaku writer Ethan Gach <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lsypye2edk2v" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> on social media that he had been told last year's demo had been "basically fake." The question of the gameplay demo's legitimacy was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adammcdlt.bsky.social/post/3lt23bz2dwk2z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussed</a> in more detail by former Perfect Dark developer Adam McDonald, who now works as a senior game designer at Cuphead maker Studio MDHR.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It is actually in-engine," McDonald said. "I was one of three level designers that worked on it. It worked best if you played it the way the person playing in the video plays it, but it still worked even if you didn't hit the marks perfectly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's some fake stuff in it," he continued, "and the real gameplay systems shown off worked juuust enough to look good in this video. We were rapidly making real design decisions so as to not knowingly lie to players about what the game will be. The parkour is all real, the hacking/deception is mostly real.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The combat is 'real' in that someone had to really do all that stuff in the video, but it's set up to be played exactly that way and didn't play well if you played it a different way."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Perfect Dark Reboot Gameplay Reveal Screenshots - Xbox Games Showcase 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What McDonald is saying then, is that there's nuance here. Like many vertical slices meant to showcase a project that's still in development, it was made to work just enough, and to give a sense of how the final game would have appeared, had the project survived until launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">McDonald's suggestion here seems to be that the team behind it intended to show something that gave as accurate a sense of what Perfect Dark would be as was possible. That said, some elements clearly still sound like they were a work-in-progress, even if they were meant to be representative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm seeing big controversy over 'THIS WHOLE THING WAS FAKE' and it's annoying me, so I wanted to say something," McDonald concluded. Then, in a reply to another user, McDonald said "it was a pretty typical vertical slice" and "I don't think we were particularly deceptive with it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: "It's probably more real than you think. We were figuring stuff out on the fly in time to include it in the demo, doing our best not to 'lie' to players. There's some fakery but quite a lot of it was legit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After the cancellation of Perfect Dark, Rare's long-awaited Everwild, an MMO from Bethesda's The Older Scrolls Online team and cuts to other projects, it's believed that every game featured at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced">the Xbox Games Showcase presentation in June</a> this year will continue on. But what about the others?
