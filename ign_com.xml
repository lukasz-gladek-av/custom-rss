As noted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wwe-2k24-now-the-only-game-in-the-series-with-online-functionality-as-2k23-servers-go-dark" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a>, WWE 2K23 goes dark today, January 6, 2025, when the servers are discontinued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This includes all online functions, such as online matches and Community Creations. Players will no longer be able to access any online game mode after this point. However if you already own the game you will be able to continue to play offline modes. The game itself and all VC (Virtual Currency), as well as DLC/Add-Ons, were pulled from sale in November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This also means WWE 2K23's PS5 and PS4 Platinum Trophy is unobtainable, the latest to fizzle out of existence with a server shutdown. Gamers have long called on the platform holders to mandate achievement and trophy changes upon a server shutdown so customers can still complete those challenges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k23-review">WWE 2K23 review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Though the Showcase mode isn’t as super as its subject, John Cena, the sharp focus on refinement instead of reinvention helps keep WWE 2K23 as the gold standard of wrestling sims."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">WWE 2K23’s server shutdown leaves last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wwe-2k24">WWE 2K24</a> as the only game in the series with online functionality. The expectation is WWE 2K25 launches around March this year, but some fans are now debating the value in investing time in these games if they fail to last even a couple of years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher 2K has form when it comes to shutting down its sports games in the immediate years after release. 2022's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k23-next-gen-version">NBA 2K23</a>, for example, shut down in December 2024. Rival sports video game maker EA tends to keep the online portion of its games running longer than 2K, with FIFA and Madden servers often up and running years after launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
