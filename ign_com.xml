Dozens of major video games were on sale this year, especially for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-mario-games-on-nintendo-switch">Nintendo Switch</a>. If you're on the hunt for a new Switch game still on sale, look no further than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>. Walmart has the masterpiece available for $39.39 today, and it's hard to beat this price, as Nintendo rarely puts its first-party games on sale. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Grab Super Mario Odyssey for $39 at Walmart</h2><div catalogid="f5eb8ae2-57bf-4d14-8f8d-fb017cf92af0" id="225206"><div id="225206" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Super Mario Odyssey - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario Odyssey stars Mario and his newfound companion Cappy as the two travel across numerous Kingdoms to stop Bowser's plans of marrying Princess Peach. It's an adventure filled with countless gameplay mechanics, challenges, and charm. The star of the show is Cappy, as he allows Mario to take control of enemies and objects in the environment thanks to the Capture mechanic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I spent over 140 hours in my initial playthrough of Mario Odyssey, as I hunted down every single Moon available in the game. Even almost eight years later, Super Mario Odyssey is still one of my favorite Nintendo Switch games. Between Moons and Purple Coins, there is no shortage of content to discover, so you'll be occupied for dozens of hours after the credits roll.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

For $149, you are getting some of the best and most convenient earbuds out there, which are perfect for taking calls, listening to music, and so much more. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake for $34.99</h2></div><div catalogid="f5eb8ae2-57bf-4d14-8f8d-fb017cf92af0" id="225203"><div id="225203" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> was one of the most enjoyable RPGs of 2024, featuring a gorgeous remade HD-2D world and voice acting. If you haven't had the chance to check this one out yet, Amazon has Nintendo Switch copies available for only $34.99. In my opinion, the Switch has to be the definitive way to experience this classic, and now is the perfect time to catch up before Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake this Fall.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save Big on Samsung Gaming Monitors</h2></div><div id="224045" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="10b6cd8c-a865-48f5-bfb6-27093bf89254"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>SAMSUNG 32‚Äù Odyssey QD-OLED G8 (G80SD) Series 4K UHD Smart Gaming Monitor</h3></p></div><div catalogid="10b6cd8c-a865-48f5-bfb6-27093bf89254" id="224046"><div id="224046" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>SAMSUNG 49-Inch Odyssey G9 (G95SD) Series OLED Curved Gaming Monitor</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Woot has two excellent Samsung gaming monitors on sale this weekend, and you can save up to $900! The first monitor we recommend is the 32" Samsung Odyssey G8, which is fitted with a QD-OLED panel and supports a refresh rate of 240Hz. This monitor is best for the richest visuals, as the OLED technology allows for true blacks. On the other hand, the Samsung G9 49" Curved OLED Gaming Monitor is a beast that will instantly transform any setup. While this monitor is normally $1899.99, you can score it for just $999.99 this weekend. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Batman: Arkham Trilogy for $29.83</h2></div><div catalogid="f5eb8ae2-57bf-4d14-8f8d-fb017cf92af0" id="225205"><div id="225205" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Batman Arkham Trilogy - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-games-in-order">Batman: Arkham games</a> are some of the most beloved superhero games out there, and the ability to play them on the Nintendo Switch is a treat in itself. Arkham Knight notoriously ran poorly on the Switch, but the Switch 2 has ironed out most of these issues seemingly thanks to its increased power. For $29.83, you can pick up the trilogy for under $10 a game, which is a pretty great deal considering this was a $60 release. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Donkey Kong Bananza Out This Week</h2></div><div catalogid="3cd545c5-1d5f-4eb7-be84-a6f92ed62e6d" id="222943"><div id="222943" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Donkey Kong Bananza - Nintendo Switch 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-exists-because-yoshiaki-koizumi-asked-the-mario-odyssey-team-for-a-3d-donkey-kong-game">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is out this week, so now is the time to lock in your copy. Bananza is set to be DK's biggest adventure yet, and this time, he's joined by a young Pauline. The two are tasked with heading to the very core of the planet, where wishes are supposedly granted. If you are looking for the next big game on Nintendo Switch 2, this right here is sure to be it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ghost in the Shell 4K for $12.49</h2></div><div catalogid="f5eb8ae2-57bf-4d14-8f8d-fb017cf92af0" id="225204"><div id="225204" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ghost in the Shell [4k + Blu-ray + Digital] [4K UHD]</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">1995's Ghost in the Shell is still one of the most influential anime films ever. Amazon has the 4K Blu-ray available for only $12.49 this weekend, and it's hard to beat that. If you've never seen this beloved film, you owe it to yourself to check it out.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Request A Nintendo Switch 2 Invitation on Amazon</h2></div><div id="224535" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="43f764a1-8692-437c-8614-00fd94472924"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>"Request invite" is now available.</p></div></div><div catalogid="43f764a1-8692-437c-8614-00fd94472924" id="224536"><div id="224536" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has at last listed the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and you can request an invite to purchase the console now. Once you are selected, you will receive an email that will allow you to add the system to your cart and purchase it. There is no telling when these invites will run out, so I recommend requesting one, even if you might purchase the Switch 2 elsewhere.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Super Mario Odyssey for $39</h2></div><div catalogid="f5eb8ae2-57bf-4d14-8f8d-fb017cf92af0" id="225206"><div id="225206" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Super Mario Odyssey - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review">Super Mario Odyssey</a> is one of the best games of all time, and it's well worth it even at $39. We rarely see this game go on sale, so it's an easy recommendation each time it does. With Nintendo Switch 2 enhancements already live, now is the time to jump in and explore various Kingdoms with Cappy if you haven't already.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Apple Watch Series 10 for $279</h2></div><div catalogid="f5eb8ae2-57bf-4d14-8f8d-fb017cf92af0" id="225208"><div id="225208" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple Watch Series 10 [GPS 42mm case] Smartwatch</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, you can score an Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm) for $279.99. That's $120 off the MSRP, and the lowest price we've seen this device at so far. Series 10 includes features like Sleep Apnea detection, a wide-angle OLED display, a temperature sensor, and more. If you don't have interest in the Apple Watch Ultra, this model will bring most of its features for just a third of the price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.
