            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony will hold a PlayStation State of Play broadcast this week offering a deep dive into Ghost of Yōtei's gameplay, the company has announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect a 20-minute look at the upcoming highly-anticipated sequel to Ghost of Tsushima, from 2pm Pacific / 5pm Eastern time this Thursday, July 10. In Europe, that's 11pm CEST, or 10pm BST.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gameplay will be introduced by Sucker Punch's two <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> creative directors, Jason Connell and Nate Fox.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ghost of Yōtei got only a brief mention during Sony's main PlayStation Showcase event last month, though promised it would focus on it more fully into a dedicated show sometime in July, ahead of the game's launch in October.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation's description of this week's State of Play teases that fans will hear more of main character Atsu's quest for vengeance, get a tour of her weaponry, plus "new ways to personalize your journey at the edge of Japan, new special modes, and much more."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Watch the Ghost of Yōtei State of Play gameplay deep dive on Thursday, July 10!

"They killed her family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree outside her home. But Atsu survived. She learned to fight, to kill, and to hunt, and after years away she has returned to her home with a list of six names: The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"One by one, she’s hunting them down to avenge her family, armed with the same katana used to pin her to that burning tree all those years ago. But while Atsu’s story begins with vengeance, she’ll find there’s more to her journey than just revenge. As she explores Ezo, Atsu will meet unlikely allies and forge connections that help give her a new sense of purpose."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a big year for blockbuster open world video games set in Japan dealing with protagonists on a quest for revenge with a list of cryptic targets to track down. Ghost of Yōtei will arrive just six months after Assassin's Creed Shadows, Ubisoft's own effort, that is set to receive a major DLC expansion at some point before the end of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help with the wait for more details, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-gameplay-story-latest-news">everything we know about Ghost of Yōtei</a> right here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
