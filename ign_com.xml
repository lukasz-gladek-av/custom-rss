            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong 64 fans celebrate! Nintendo will pay tribute to a pair of classic N64 characters via an upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> Emerald Rush DLC challenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After years left in the wilderness, both Chunky Kong and Lanky Kong will return in the DLC as "exclusive in-game statues", Nintendo has today <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1990389457187455057" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a>, as part of the upcoming So Strong It's Funny in-game challenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event, set to run from November 25 to December 2, will be set on the game's Hilltop Layer. As of yet, there's no word on exactly how may points players will need to rack up to earn these latest cosmetic items used to decorate DK Island.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/17/16x9-nswitch-donkeykongbananza-sostrongitsfunny-1920x1080-gb-en-image1280w-1763384530128.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">They're finally here! It's Lanky Kong and Chunky Kong.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, long-term Kong fans are simply celebrating the fact that Nintendo has referenced these long-lost characters at all, after only a handful of glimpses over the past few decades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Brawny but gentle Chunky Kong (cousin of Dixie Kong) has only made three video game appearances since his 1999 debut in Donkey Kong 64. He cameos in a Donkey Kong Country 3 mini-game on Game Boy Advance, then pops up as a sticker and spirit in Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Ultimate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eagle-eyed fans also spotted a split-second appearance by Chunky Kong in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-bros-movie">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, standing alongside an equally-brief appearance for Diddy and Dixie — though you'll need to pause the film to really know it's him. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans had hoped that this appearance, and the fact Nintendo had gone to the trouble of slightly tweaking his design, suggested more appearances for Chunky Kong in future. And indeed, Bananza's upcoming statue seems to feature this same slightly-tweaked look. Could we see more of him in the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, or perhaps even that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-has-filed-a-copyright-notice-for-an-untitled-donkey-kong-motion-picture">long-rumored upcoming Donkey Kong movie</a> spin-off? Time will tell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The long-armed Lanky Kong, meanwhile, is similarly little-seen. He didn't get a Super Mario Bros. Movie cameo, but did appear as an unlockable character in 2007 Wii racer Donkey Kong: Barrel Blast. Could we be seeing more of him in the future too?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you haven't picked it up already, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush-first-hands-on-impressions">Bananza's DLC</a> is stuffed full of references to Donkey Kong 64 and other past classics, with appearances from Diddy, Dixie, Cranky, Squawks the parrot from Donkey Kong Country and DK's house from Donkey Kong Country Returns. Other Kongs referenced (but not seen) include a poster for Candy Kong (don't ask) and a pair of Donkey Konga bongo drums to bounce around on top of. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So now, who's next for a return?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has issued takedown notices for videos showcasing a fan-led project that's bringing doomed PlayStation live-service game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord"><u>Concord</u></a> back to life. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation's quickly-binned hero shooter Concord was one of the biggest flops in the compay's history. Amid disastrously low player numbers, Sony pulled the game offline just two weeks after launch, with one estimate suggesting it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"><u>sold just 25,000 copies</u></a>. It proved a costly failure for Sony, with hundreds of millions of dollars wasted. Its developer, Firewalk Studios, closed shortly thereafter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite its brief life, or perhaps because of it, Concord remains of interest — with a dedicated group of players dedicating "months" of work to getting the game back online again, reverse-engineering the code and using private servers to host online matches of Clash Point. And now, it seems, Sony has taken notice.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"After a long time of reverse engineering [and] server development, we just managed to play a match of Concord!" the team announced on Discord (thanks, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-cracks-down-concord-custom-servers-dmca-takedowns/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Game Post</u></a>). "The project is still WIP, it's playable, but buggy. Once our servers are fully set up, we'll begin doing some private playtesting, if anyone here wants to join those playtests, let me know (include what region/time zone you are in for convenience)." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the volunteer developers admitted the build could be "buggy," the team managed to get the main menu, character select screen, and matchmaking working again, with one team member <a href="https://discord.gg/q9Q2N52agh" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>saying</u></a>, "the project is still a [work in progress but] it's playable."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around this time, volunteers began sharing videos and images of their project in action and posted them to YouTube. But news of the project gained traction, it also appears to have caught the eye of Sony, which has seemingly begun striking down the videos with copyright notices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans behind the rebuilt game appear keen to make clear their attempt only provides server access to players who had legitimately bought the game, rather than anyone using or sharing "copyrighted files." In a message on the fan project's Discord: "I know this sucks for people who got forcefully refunded, but lawyers are most likely already watching everything we do and I want to ensure this project stays as legal as we realistically can do. We will be removing any posts containing links to copyrighted files."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite this, however, the group leaders have now paused invitations, stating they had received "worrying legal action."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Concord Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In February 2022, Jim Ryan, then-PlayStation's boss, announced that the company would launch more than 10 new live-service games by<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-by-2026"><u> March 2026</u></a>, and spent big on studio buyouts as part of the drive, bringing in Destiny developer Bungie, Jade Raymond's Haven Studios (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-woes-continue-as-playstation-executive-jade-raymond-exits-fairgames-developer-after-external-test-sparked-concern"><u>Raymond has since left the company</u></a>), and the now-shuttered Firewalk Studios. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, however, Sony has cancelled a slew of projects, including a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>live-service God of War title in development at Bluepoint</u></a>, and another live-service title being made by Days Gone developer Bend.
