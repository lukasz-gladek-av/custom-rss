            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/delta-force-black-hawk-down-preview-a-solid-job-of-reviving-a-classic-military-fps-campaign</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/delta-force-black-hawk-down-preview-a-solid-job-of-reviving-a-classic-military-fps-campaign.1113294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/delta-force-black-hawk-down-preview-a-solid-job-of-reviving-a-classic-military-fps-campaign<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Jade’s Delta Force: Hawk Ops revival was always planned to be an ambitious attempt at the modern military shooter in three distinct flavors: large scale tactical team-vs.-team multiplayer; Escape from Tarkov-inspired extraction shooter; and a focused, high-energy single-player campaign. The Warfare and Operations modes launched last year to mostly positive reception, but the single-player campaign – a remake of the original Black Hawk Down game inspired by the 1999 book that inspired the 2001 movie – was still in the oven cooking up a lot of intrigue. I finally got some hands-on time with a small selection of missions ahead of its launch, and while I can confidently say that it does genuinely capture the spirit of an old-school, turn-of-the-century shooter campaign, there are still enough unanswered questions that being guardedly optimistic is the only answer I could come up with after my time with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s going to be pretty tough for people who didn’t play the original game 20 years ago to compare it to Team Jade’s modern interpretation directly, since it’s not currently available digitally and physical copies of the old PC, PS2, and Xbox versions are becoming more and more scarce every year. But I was one of those people who was wading in the waves of the military shooter revolution at the time – the first Call of Duty launched the same year as Black Hawk Down, and Battlefield 1942 dropped the year prior. But I distinctly remember Black Hawk Down having some standout gameplay features that really raised the bar for the genre as a whole. It featured big, sprawling level maps that offer multiple ways to approach objectives. Some mission sequences would change dramatically depending on the current task, taking you from the back of a humvee to an on-foot stand-off with ambushers to a hurried escape via helicopter, all in the same chapter. And bullet physics and gun handling, specifically the more realistic projectile speeds, bullet drops, lethality, and recoil, made skirmishes less arcadey and more dangerous. Mixed with absolutely arid checkpointing, NovaLogic’s Black Hawk Down was one of the toughest games in the genre.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Delta Force Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Jade’s Black Hawk Down certainly comes from a place of reverence for the old game, obvious in the way it tries to capture this old style of shooting in its missions, and also in the effusive praise game director Shadow and designer Novak laid on the other old work. “When we played the original in cafes so many years ago, it was mind-blowing,” said Joe Meng, PR Manager of Team Jade, translating on Shadow’s behalf. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This Black Hawk Down certainly comes from a place of reverence for the old game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing the initial mission, where we infiltrated the city in search of the enemy stronghold via a rooftop from a building nearby, the tense exchanges of fire between my squad of four (all played by other humans in co-op) and the enemies proved that keeping bullets dangerous was a top priority in their translation. It didn’t take much to drop us to dangerously low health, and that health did not restore itself after being out of combat for a bit. Only specific health restoratives could get us back to ship shape, and only medics – one of the four classes available to choose from – could provide them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once we got out to the street, progress became slightly less linear. This isn’t an open-world map, and there was a clear target that we had to infiltrate, but the path there felt open-ended. My squad, split into pairs, tiptoed down both sides of the street, following some NPC teammates in clearing buildings we passed on our way to the objective, in this case a hotel under control of rebels who were holding hostages somewhere in the building. We entered the building through the front, where the heaviest fire was being exchanged from the lobby plaza to our entrenched spot in the entrance. We could have found a side door and attempted to flank the lobby shooters as well, I found out later, and though you don’t have Hitman-levels of freedom, it is refreshing to know that if this Black Hawk Down has difficult chokepoints, the answer may lie in just finding a safer route. Shadow mentioned that the feeling of relief and reward for overcoming stacked odds was a driving sensation in the design, and this was a great example of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This mission was a little more linear than the next one we tried, which saw us sprinting through a claustrophobic shanty town attempting to get to the crashed Black Hawk helicopters. The mission’s pace and setting was very reminiscent of the original’s Valiant Heroes mission, which features a maze of buildings players had to navigate while freeing stranded friendly soldiers from incoming militia. Both used the labyrinth as an advantage for the enemies, who could pop out from around corners without warning, but where the original made you differentiate between hostile militia members and disgruntled civilians (penalizing you for harming the latter), this updated mission treated everyone in the branching alleyways or dusty markets that wasn’t you as an enemy. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Jade’s take does add snipers who can shoot at players from long distances from the relative safety of a clock tower several blocks away, uses modern environment design trends to make the city dense with small, open shacks and streets to navigate, and checkpoints that bottleneck the sprawling neighborhoods into points of entrenched resistance where more direct assault is required to continue. This was where the difficulty was its most intense, as enemies appeared from all directions, constantly moving while obscured by buildings and searching diligently for angles to take us by surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I did miss the detail of having to show some semblance of trigger discipline under these conditions, though. It was certainly engaging and fun, but even in the face of the obvious danger, it felt like a step backwards from the kind of provocative design of the original. And in our limited test, we only tried out two of the seven total missions in the campaign, but neither gave the sense of dynamic scenario switching like the original’s River Raid, which starts as an on foot trek across the desert, turns into a frantic car chase through a minefield, then transforms into a Metal Gear Solid 3-esque tiptoe through the a Somalian river full of crocodiles, and then finally finishes with a multi-stage raid on a village. Of course this, or something equally as energetic, could be in the full three- to four-hour campaign, and I won’t discount the remake’s dedication to the original’s boldness of mission design before deploying myself when it launches on February 21st.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-monster-hunter-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-10-best-monster-hunter-games.1113288/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-monster-hunter-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">For the last 20 years Capcom's Monster Hunter series has captured fans' hearts with its exhilarating mix of careful strategy and heart-pounding monster battles. From its humble beginnings on the PlayStation 2 in 2004 to topping the charts in 2018 with Monster Hunter World, the series has evolved a lot in the last two decades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While every Monster Hunter game is unique in its own way, we’ve ranked the entire list of games plus the biggest DLCs, to determine which is the very best. One note to consider – given that Capcom has released multiple versions of some of the games, our ranking only takes into consideration the Ultimate versions of each of these. So with that cleared up, let’s kick things off…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Monster Hunter</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-1-1739896860712.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Monster Hunter laid the foundation for everything to come in the 20 years that followed. Its obtuse directions and control scheme might make it harder to revisit than most of the other games on this list, but the core pillars of what makes Monster Hunter great are still present. Taking on larger-than-life beasts with nothing but a weapon and a knack for survival helped set it apart in 2004, even if its steep learning curve made it a somewhat frustrating experience for players at the time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed as part of an initiative at Capcom to focus on online games for the PlayStation 2, Monster Hunter's primary focus is through its online event missions. While it's a bummer that official servers are no longer online outside of Japan, the single-player still lets players experience the hunts that kicked off a new genre.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Monster Hunter Freedom</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-freedom-1739896890820.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Freedom released on the PlayStation Portable in Japan in 2005, and followed everywhere else a year later. It was the first handheld game in the series and is an expanded and re-tuned version of Monster Hunter G.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Freedom includes everything from Monster Hunter G and adds in a number of quality of life improvements, the biggest jump was giving Monster Hunter a new home on a portable device. It was the catalyst that pushed Monster Hunter to a whole new audience, putting co-op front and center and bringing together millions of players as they teamed up to hunt, no matter where they were.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite its clunky controls and wonky camera – which really demonstrate how far the games have evolved – Freedom is still a lot of fun to play. True, it's not the best Monster Hunter game but it’s certainly one of the most important, and became the blueprint for the future of the series’ handheld games. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Monster Hunter Freedom Unite</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-freedom-unite-1739896906136.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Freedom Unite is an expanded version of Monster Hunter Freedom 2, which itself is an expanded version of Monster Hunter 2, which was only released in Japan. It was easily the largest game in the series when it was released and introduced new monsters that have gone on to become high points for the series, including black panther-cross-lizard wyvern,  Nargacuga. It was also the first time the much-loved Felyne companions joined you on the battlefield, and while they might not have helped overcome some of Freedom Unite’s tougher challenges, they made the journey a lot more enjoyable. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-1739896920149.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate was built off of the bones of 2010's Monster Hunter Tri, but with a restructured story and difficulty curve to create a more streamlined experience that included new monsters and quests to keep things fresh. Furthermore, Ultimate 3 brought back the Hunting Horn, Bow, Gunlance, and Dual Blades – which were missing from Tri – to give a more rounded roster of weapons for players to wield. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s therefore no surprise that Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is the definitive Monster Hunter 3 experience. New encounters like underwater fighting added a lot of variety to keep everything feeling fresh, even if you had to wrestle with the camera to make it work properly. And while online multiplayer on the Wii U was not as advanced as it was on other consoles, co-op is so integral to the Monster Hunter experience that its inclusion was a must.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is the natural evolution of everything that came before it and is a strong contender for one of the better monster hunting experiences. It’s showing its age now though, leaving room for other games…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-4-ultimate-1739896935456.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate marked an important turning point for the series. While local co-op was always Monster Hunter’s bread and butter on handheld consoles, dedicated online multiplayer finally arrived in 4 Ultimate, delivering a true leap forward for the series. Now it didn’t matter where your friends were – as long as everyone had access to wifi you could party up and take on a hunt from anywhere in the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Capcom debuted Apex Monsters to give skilled players true endgame challenges to test their mettle against, and these are easily some of the toughest fights in the series to date. Other improvements included a huge roster of monsters to hunt and the addition of vertical movement, which transformed how the game played and almost doubled the size of the map. Monster Hunter 4 really was a leap forward for the series, but it’s still not the best the series has to offer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Monster Hunter Rise</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-rise-1739896953774.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">2021's Monster Hunter Rise brought the series back home to handhelds after jumping to consoles and PC with Monster Hunter World in 2018. Originally exclusive to the Nintendo Switch, Rise took what Capcom learned from making bigger-scale Monster Hunter games on consoles and refined them for handhelds, delivering a faster-paced game with more streamlined features for a smoother overall experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Rise introduced Palamutes, the rideable dog companions that allowed for easier and speedier movement around Rise's maps. It was a welcomed addition that Capcom seems to be repeating, by bringing back Seikrets in Monster Hunter Wilds. Combined with the new Wirebug mechanic, which unlocked new weapon attacks and let you grapple high up into the air like your favorite anime protagonist, Rise brought a sense of scale previously only found on the console versions of Monster Hunter games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it was decimating monsters with acrobatic stunts or soaking up the serene vibe of Kamura Village, Monster Hunter Rise proves that, after scaling up for Monster Hunter World, all those big design ideas could be scaled down to create one of the best handheld Monster Hunter experiences in the entire series. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-1739896973922.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The follow up to Monster Hunter Rise was a massive expansion called Sunbreak, which added an all new location, ferocious new monsters, and a revised weapons system that added freshness to the fights. While Sunbreak doesn't reinvent the wheel, it makes Rise’s already amazing experience even better. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most memorable thing about Sunbreak is how Capcom delivered full-fledged gothic horror vibes thanks to the new Citadel castle location and fascinating monster designs inspired by vampires and werewolves. It also addressed the series’ previous lack of endgame content by adding super tough hunts designed to challenge even the most experienced players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sunbreak’s gothic setting might be one of the most beautiful locales ever introduced in the series but the true brilliance of this monster-sized expansion remains the final fight against the vampiric flagship monster, Malzeno, and the horrors of its life-stealing abilities. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-generations-ultimate-1739896995204.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In many ways, Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate is Capcom’s swansong to the last decade of Monster Hunter games. Alongside a hugely satisfying customization suite for hunters, Generations Ultimate also features the largest roster of monsters across the entire series. With 93 large monsters, Generations Ultimate is like a greatest hits from your favorite band.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike most other Monster Hunter games, Generations Ultimate features Hunter Styles, which can radically change the way you play. In addition to the usual weapon types, Hunting Styles gave every weapon four unique movesets to choose from, dramatically increasing the fighting styles on offer. Veteran players could stick with the standard Guild style they’re familiar with, or experiment with new styles like Striker, which let players chain together Hunting Arts, turning them into special moves to learn and master. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This deep level of customization was hugely experimental and tremendously fun. Combined with endless hours of hunts, Generations Ultimate is a victory lap for the series, a triumphant showpiece of the iconic monster designs and the joys of playing with friends and family.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-1739897014045.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom followed up the hugely successful Monster Hunter World with the large-scale expansion, Iceborne, and to this day it remains our second-favorite Monster Hunter experience in the entire series. Iceborne’s massive new campaign and long list of hunts makes it feel like a proper sequel to World rather than just an expansion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Guiding Lands – a hodgepodge of previous zones mashed together – created an entirely seamless experience that felt like a highlight reel of all the best parts of Monster Hunter World in one area. It also added countless quality-of-life improvements to what was already one of the best games in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it was Iceborne’s new monsters that really stuck with fans, and Savage Deviljho, Velkhana, and Fatalis are considered by many to be some of the best monsters in any game in the series. Indeed, Iceborne could’ve made it to the top spot in this list if it wasn’t for the original game that came before it…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Monster Hunter: World</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-world-1739897030227.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">2018's Monster Hunter: World kicked off a global frenzy for Monster Hunter like no other game in the series. After years of primarily being a handheld game and labeled with the caveat “Big in Japan”, World brought the series back to its console roots on PlayStation and Xbox, and rocketed it to an entirely new audience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter: World's foundation was rock solid because it offered players some of the largest open zones in the series and emphasized the pure excitement hunters have while tracking and hunting enormous monsters. Indeed, it’s Monster Hunter: World’s sense of scale that sets head and shoulders above its peers. Whether it’s seeing a Rathalos swooping down and flying away with a weakened Anjanath, or witnessing a Diablos burst in on your hunt, Monster Hunter: World didn’t just create a breathtaking setting to play around in, it made you feel like you were in the middle of a sophisticated ecosystem of apex predators all fighting for supremacy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the dense jungle to the high cliffs of the Coral Highlands, exploring World’s diverse environments felt like traveling the globe, bolstered by unique monsters designed to perfectly compliment its surroundings. There is a sense of place for everything, including the endemic life that makes Monster Hunter: World almost like a nature documentary, except, y’know, fun. What’s more, Monster Hunter: World’s story was given a much needed facelift thanks to high quality cutscenes made possible by running on more powerful home consoles, which only added to the brilliant sandbox world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So World is not only a must-have for both fans of Monster Hunter and newcomers alike, but it’s an all-time great video game period.  </p><div id="the-10-best-monster-hunter-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">The 10 Best Monster Hunter Games</h3><h3>The 10 Best Monster Hunter Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That's our ranking of the 10 best Monster Hunter games of all time.

To release and support The Last of Us Online we’d have to put all our studio resources behind supporting post launch content for years to come, severely impacting development on future single-player games. So, we had two paths in front of us: become a solely live service games studio or continue to focus on single-player narrative games that have defined Naughty Dog’s heritage.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naughty Dog went on to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-heads-to-space-with-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-the-game-awards-2024">announce single-player adventure Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet at The Game Awards 2024</a>, its first new franchise in over a decade.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Naughty Dog Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, speaking to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sacred-symbols-122597374" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacred Symbols+</a> (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/yoshida-i-played-the-last-of-us-online-and-it-was-great" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Square</a>), Shuhei Yoshida touched on the internal decision-making that led to The Last of Us Online’s cancelation, saying feedback from Destiny developer Bungie, which Sony had acquired, helped to convince Naughty Dog to scrap the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The idea for The Last of Us Online came from Naughty Dog and they really wanted to make it,” Yoshida said. “But Bungie explained [to them] what it takes to make live service games, and Naughty Dog realised, ‘Oops, we can’t do that! If we do it, we can’t make Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.’ So that was a lack of foresight.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This tallies with prior reports that indicated Naughty Dog had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-needs-more-time-naughty-dog"><u>scaled back</u></a> development of The Last of Us Online due to an internal review from Bungie. In October 2023, Naughty Dog reportedly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dogs-troubled-the-last-of-us-multiplayer-spin-off-reportedly-on-ice-amid-layoffs"><u>suffered a round of layoffs</u></a> and that the multiplayer project was “put on ice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cancelation of The Last of Us Online came as part of a sweeping pull back from live service at Sony Interactive Entertainment following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstations-10-live-service-games-will-be-from-different-genres-and-for-different-audiences">a huge internal push to make more of these types of games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Arrowhead’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> was a breakout hit, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, Sony’s other live service games were either canceled or suffered disastrous launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s live service hero shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a> is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history, lasting just a couple of weeks before it was brought offline amid eye-wateringly low player numbers. Sony later decided to kill the game entirely and shut its developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord's initial development deal was around $200 million according to a report by <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kotaku</u></a>. It said the $200 million was not enough to fund Concord's entire development, nor did it include the purchase of the Concord IP rights or Firewalk Studios itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And just last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony canceled two unannounced live service games</u></a>, one a God of War title in development at Bluepoint, the other in the works at Days Gone developer Bend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a prior interview, Yoshida, who was President of SIE Worldwide Studios for Sony Interactive Entertainment from 2008 to 2019, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-wouldve-tried-to-resist-sonys-live-service-push">said he would have tried to resist Sony’s controversial live service video game push</a> and that Sony always knew its investment in live service games was risky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, speaking to Sacred Symbols+, Yoshida said that as far as he was aware, no first-party PlayStation Studio was forced to make a live service game. Rather they saw an opportunity to successfully pitch a live service game given Sony’s video game strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“From my experience, when studios see the company has a big initiative, [they realise] riding on that gives them a better chance of getting a project approved and supported,” Yoshida said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s not like [current PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst] is telling teams they need to make live service games, it’s likely mutual.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of Sony’s live service push and pull is hundreds of millions of dollars wasted, widespread layoffs, studio closures, and years of work that will never see the light of day. Developers face enormous gaps in their CVs with nothing to show for it, and PlayStation 5 looks set for a light period for first-party games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there are a number of PlayStation Studios live service games Sony has yet to cancel, including Guerrilla’s multiplayer Horizon project, Bungie’s extraction shooter Marathon, and the multiplayer heist game Fairgames.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
