            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-will-shut-down-anthem-in-january">announced it would shut down BioWare's Anthem</a> on January 12, 2026. And now, after a rocky six years for the game, its executive producer Mark Darrah has come forward to share details on exactly how Anthem came to be, and what went wrong in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_QY8F8z_4c" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">part one of a planned multi-part video series</a>, Darrah spends an hour walking viewers through Anthem's development as he understands it from 2011 through the moment he took over as executive producer in 2017. Admittedly, his perspective isn't 100% complete, as Darrah was not working directly on the game throughout much of this time. But as a higher-up at BioWare and eventual executive producer, he was nonetheless positioned to see a lot more than most.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah was only executive producer for the final 16 months of the game's development. Even so, he opens the video by taking ownership of Anthem's failings and struggles:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Some of this video is going to look like I'm trying to shift blame around, but ultimately the responsibility for this game does mostly rest on me," he says. "I have a list of people that I won't share that I also feel share blame on this project. Almost everyone on that list is more senior than me. The team worked really hard on this game, the team put a lot of excellent work on this game, and there are things that are amazing in this game even now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah goes on to walk through the first six years of development, outlining a number of pitfalls Anthem ran into along the way. He talks about Anthem's original conception at a time within EA where its executives believed single-player games were no longer desirable, leaving BioWare in a challenging position as an historically single-player-focused studio. BioWare lead Casey Hudson's early vision of Anthem, he says, was to do BioWare storytelling in a live service, always online format, and he proposed they come up with a new, never-before-seen business model to do it. That's how Anthem initially got momentum internally among EA's executive leadership. As Darrah puts it, "What if BioWare game, but it could do FIFA numbers?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, early on, Anthem ran into trouble because it struggled to get personnel to actually work on it. At one point, BioWare workers were shown a presentation intended for executives that outlined the game's more live service-y vision, and this put many developers off the idea. Additionally, as BioWare shipped Dragon Age: Inquisition, staff kept being moved to Mass Effect: Andromeda, leaving Anthem without the staff Hudson wanted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another trouble with Anthem highlighted by Darrah was the repeated shifting of what the game actually was. While the original pitch was to make something wholly unique, Darrah talks about how difficult that actually is when you can't offer reference points to developers or explain it to executives via familiar touchstones. So over time, Anthem did actually become more like familiar games such as Destiny and Borderlands.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In an early design document, Anthem was going to have six javelins. Where did this number come from? It got pulled out of someone's ass.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet another issue, says Darrah, was the level of secrecy involved. While he acknowledges it's important to keep things locked up to avoid leaks, there's a certain level to which he believes it's good to share details more widely. In the early days, he recalls Hudson would strategically share certain elements of Anthem within the wider organization, which allowed him to create excitement and gather feedback. But when Hudson left, no one stepped into that role, and Anthem became aggressively secretive. As a result, Darrah says, it was easier to hand-wave issues, tailor messaging to a very small group of people who were more susceptible to groupthink.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah also tells a pretty pointed story about how being too specific about expectations too early on can lead to disaster. Here's his full recounting of why Anthem didn't have six javelins when it launched:</p><blockquote>In a pretty early design document, Anthem stated that it was going to have six javelins. Where did this number come from? It basically got pulled out of someone's ass. I guess to be more fair, it was effectively broken down like this: We're going to have light, medium, and heavy javelins, so we're going to have two of each kind...and unfortunately this number, six, got presented in early 2017 to EA executives, that Anthem was going to have six javelins.</blockquote><blockquote>Pretty close to that presentation, the team realized that it couldn't do six javelins, for two primary reasons. One, because it couldn't completely figure out how to differentiate six different kinds of javelins, but also because it realized that it didn't have time to make six entirely different archetypes of gameplay. So now, the team is forced to present that no, in fact they're going to have four javelins at launch, and even though that six was based on nothing, was based on a number we said because it kind of seemed pretty logical at the time, but there's nothing behind that, became a source of immense pressure and anxiety from the executives.</blockquote><blockquote>I wouldn't be surprised to find out that one of the reasons that everything came to a head in 2017, with the massive changes that occurred on the project in 2017, culminating in me taking over the project, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that this was triggered by this change from six javelins to four. Again, that number six was based on nothing, but it was seen as the team falling apart.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah goes on to say that he remembers one of the cut javelins was a tanky paladin javelin that was more of a support class, while the other was a medium-class that he cannot remember at all — highlighting how nebulous the idea was to begin with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Toward the end of his video, Darrah talks about a push at EA in 2016 for all its AAA franchises to be "billion-dollar franchises", which would have involved Dragon Age releasing a game every two years. This push is also what sealed Anthem's fate as a live service game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah also cites three different occasions where he told leadership he thought they should push Anthem's release date out further, let Anthem define itself more, ship Andromeda first, and then bring Andromeda people over to finish Anthem. All three times, he says, he was turned down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_QY8F8z_4c" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can watch Darrah's full video here.</a> He says he has at least a part two, and perhaps also a part three planned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anthem eventually launched in February of 2019 to middling reviews, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/21/anthem-review">with our own reviewer giving it a 6.5/10</a> and criticizing the grindiness, lack of polish and variety, and mismatched story. It fell short of EA's sales expectations, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anthem-development-ceases-bioware-to-focus-on-dragon-age-mass-effect">EA ceased active development in 2021.</a> EA will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-will-shut-down-anthem-in-january">shut the game down entirely</a> on January 12, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">RTA in Japan, a well-established charity speedrunning contest, has removed Nintendo games from its upcoming Summer 2025 event, despite showcasing them for the past nine years. This is because they suddenly received a warning from Nintendo about using games without permission. The non-profit hopes to feature Nintendo titles again in future events, likely having to lodge individual applications on a per-game, per-event basis. But why has Nintendo suddenly done this now?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First held in 2016, RTA in Japan is a charity speedrunning event. Contestants apply to play through all or part of their chosen game, aiming to break records or just smash their personal best in front of an audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, a huge number of games have been featured in previous events, ranging from NES classics to recent titles. Their upcoming event, RTA in Japan Summer 2025, takes place in Tokyo from August 9-15, with proceeds going to Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières). The line-up includes Cuphead, Castlevania Dracula X, Final Fantasy IX, Silent Hill 2 remake and Wattam, to name a few. However, all the Mario and Kirby titles that have been part of the event in previous years are glaringly absent.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/gettyimages-2217743482-1754500679089.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Don't expect Nintendo games at Japan's biggest charity speedrunning event. Photo by RICHARD A. BROOKS/AFP via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On August 4, RTA in Japan posted an <a href="https://rtain.jp/rtaij/nintendo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official announcement</u></a> on their website, explaining exactly why the Summer 2025 event will not feature any Nintendo titles. According to the announcement, Nintendo pointed out to the non-profit organization on June 13 that “organizations require prior permission to use Nintendo games,” adding that RTA in Japan’s previous use of Nintendo titles was “unauthorized,” as permission was not obtained in advance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon receiving this notification, RTA in Japan began negotiations with Nintendo, in the hopes of using the Japanese game giants’ titles again for future events. As of August 4, it has been decided that RTA in Japan will apply for permission on a per-event, per-game basis, basically having to ask Nintendo every single time one of their contestants wants to play through a game (even if it has been featured at a previous RTA in Japan event). In their announcement, RTA in Japan revealed that they were unable to establish clear guidelines on this process in time for the Summer 2025 event, hence the decision to omit Nintendo titles this time round.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RTA in Japan also apologized to those who had applied to speedrun Nintendo games for the Summer 2025 and had their hopes dashed. Considering the number of Nintendo titles including classic games like Super Mario 64, in previous RTA in Japan event line-ups, it seems likely that many applicants were disappointed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At first glance, this seems like over-protective Nintendo picking on a small charity event. However, the majority of Japanese-speaking users commenting on the matter via Twitter / X took a balanced view of the situation or even sided with Nintendo, with many saying they understood why Nintendo had taken this action now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RTA in Japan started off as a small, volunteer-run effort. However, over the past few years it has grown into a large public event with major sponsors, and the organizer is now registered as a general incorporated association, with all the bureaucracy and responsibility that brings. The event’s growing prominence is likely what made Nintendo sit up and take notice. Some <a href="https://x.com/wsSe4nneZyMWvW1/status/1952515228874559675" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commenters</u></a> even said RTA in Japan should have been more responsible and proactively taken measures to ensure that they had Nintendo’s permission to avoid disruption to speedrun events (comments archived on <a href="https://togetter.com/li/2585429" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Togetter</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a side note, with the Summer 2025 event, RTA in Japan will be doing <a href="https://x.com/englishrestream/status/1949258455589548514" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>restreams of speedruns with English commentary</u></a> for the first time, making the event more accessible to viewers overseas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by RICHARD A.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tekken spinoff <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tekken-tag-tournament">Tekken Tag Tournament</a> won over a generation of fans not just for coming out alongside the PS2 in the year 2000 (and having an amazing Tekken Bowl minigame built in), but for being a quality Tekken game in its own right. A sequel followed in 2011, but since then Bandai Namco has remained quiet on the prospect of a series return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But is now the time, given tag fighting games are back in vogue with the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/invincible-vs">Invincible VS</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/2xko">2XKO</a> in the works, for Tekken Tag Tournament to finally return?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We asked Kohei Ikeda (Nakatsu), game director on Tekken 8, Katsuhiro Harada, Tekken Project director, and Michael Murray, Tekken 8 producer exactly that. Harada’s response makes for interesting reading for fighting game fans. He said, essentially, that a new Tekken Tag Tournament would be too much for casual fighting game fans to contend with because it would force players to learn multiple complex characters and how they work together. And so, it’s far more likely for Tekken Tag Tournament to pop up as a separate mode within a standard Tekken game, should Bandai Namco ever decide to return to it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Back in '99 when I made the original Tag Tournament… each character has so many moves in a 3D fighter, right, compared to these other games that there's so much to learn just for one character,” Harada began.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then to pair that with two, even though back then in Tag 1, a lot of the characters were called compatible or you'd have versions that look different, but they share a similar type of move list. Whereas the Tekken series progressed, the characters became more unique in their move sets, etc. So it's even more involved to try to learn and master a character, and then another one on top of that. And then when you throw in the combination of the two and your opponent's characters, there's just so much more knowledge that's necessary to enjoy the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So the hardcore, they ate it up, for example, in Tag 2. But for your average player, it was very hard to gain a more casual audience, I guess you could say. So if we were to do it again rather than have a standalone game, it would probably be better to have it as some kind of a separate mode within a normal Tekken franchise, right?”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/gettyimages-2221602697-1754482065283.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Harada has thoughts on a potential Tekken Tag Tournament return. Photo by Sia KAMBOU / AFP.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Michael Murray, Tekken 8 producer, chimed in to agree with Harada’s point about tag fighters being harder to learn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nakatsu and myself, we probably grew up in the arcades playing while he was making Tag 1, so we really enjoy the game,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I guess we're more on the hardcore side of being able to use several characters and such, and we loved Tag 2. But we are fully aware that there were just so many people that couldn't get a handle on it because of all the knowledge that's involved.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, it seems Tekken Tag Tournament is consigned to history. But Tekken 8 continues. It’s worth reading the interview in full to get an idea of what’s to come, and what Harada and co have up their sleeve for the coming years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A group of rhythm game genre veterans has re-established the RedOctane Games brand, via a new studio set to launch a fresh Guitar Hero-style title. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the name RedOctane sounds familiar, that's because it was the original studio that partnered with Harmonix to create Guitar Hero back in the early 2000s. That earlier version of RedOctane was then quickly acquired by Activision (which also ultimately shut it down).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, this new incarnation of RedOctane has been established as part of Embracer, and will be led by Simon Ebejer, who worked as production director on various Guitar Hero titles during the franchise's Neversoft heyday, before later moving on to Vicarious Visions and Blizzard.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"This game won't be Guitar Hero, DJ Hero, Guitar Freaks or Rockband," RedOctane teased in a <a href="https://www.redoctane.games/https/redoctanegamessquarespacecom/news/blog-1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> today. "This is something new. A rhythm game built with love, by people who care, with the community at its core in this fast-changing modern world we live in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We firmly believe the expert here is the community and a new generation of development talent, the folks that have kept the lights on these last few years."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Staffed by a mix of new and veteran developers, RedOctane's rhythm project will be overseen by brothers Charles and Kai Huang, founders of the original RedOctane, as part of a special advisory board. Further details on the game, including a name and project release date, currently remain under wraps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this isn't the first attempt at a rhythm genre revival. Back in late 2023, Epic Games launched <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite-festival">Fortnite Festival</a>, a Guitar Hero-style mode developed by Harmonix (now a part of Epic) that allowed players to tap along via standard controllers or more recent instrument accesories. The offering is still kept updated with weekly tunes, but has not attracted the same player numbers as Fortnite's main battle royale modes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Music has done extraordinarily well in Fortnite, but ironically, not so much in music games," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-sweeney-says-fortnites-biggest-challenge-is-convincing-people-its-the-everything-game-and-not-just-a-battle-royale">Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney told IGN earlier this year</a>, "more just in Battle Royale and elsewhere.

One of the people it inspired was horror fan and board game designer <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/114290/judson-cowan" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Judson Cowan</a>, and he set about riffing on its inspiration to deliver a cardboard equivalent, a marriage of theme and delivery as yet untapped on tabletop. </p><div catalogid="38514f7c-d341-458a-a4e6-6515bd2c8acb" id="226461"><div id="226461" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Deep Regrets</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is Deep Regrets, and we’ve climbed aboard and sailed it out so we can check whether all’s shipshape and Bristol fashion. We also wanted to see how it compares to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games"><u>top horror board games</u></a> on the market. </p></div><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box">What’s in the Box</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/pxl-20250729-192418469-1754491160356.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Deep Regrets comes in a small box but it’s heavy with contents. Lifting the lid reveals a number of small player boards. There’s a main one to track the fish swimming in the three different depth levels available to dredge, a port board for when you sail back to dry land to sell your catch and equip your boat, the ocean madness board that tracks each player’s state of mind, and a number of double-sided player boards for tracking the status of your game. The sides are functionally identical, it’s just that one side has a sinister-looking old sea dog and the other side has... an even more sinister-looking old sea dog. That tells you a lot about what kind of game this is going to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of the weight comes from various decks of cards. There are three decks of fish, one for each depth, plus a deck of “dinks,” tiny fish you can gain if your main catch gets away. There are also decks of rods, reels and “supply” that you can buy at port. The biggest deck of all is the deck of regrets which you pick up for undertaking regrettable actions at sea. There’s also a cloth bag of custom dice shaped like fishing floats, various chunky wooden tokens and a metal “fish coin” used to flip and resolve some card effects. Finally there’s a paper pad for tracking your catches in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo</a> variant.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest deck of all is the deck of regrets which you pick up for undertaking regrettable actions at sea.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to overstate just how evocative the visual design of the game is. Everything is decorated with art by the game’s designer, even the inside of the box lid. He’s a talented artist, creating detailed, imaginative visuals that strike a pitch-perfect stylistic balance between fun and creepy. Once you start flipping the fish cards, the chance to see new ones, or re-examining familiar ones for details that you missed becomes a major draw to replay the game alongside the fun of dice-rolling and decision-making.</p><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How it Plays</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/pxl-20250725-101709531-1754491251318.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The game is normally played over six days from Monday to Saturday.

You then make one of the game’s key decisions, whether you’ll spend the day at sea or head to port. Everyone starts at sea, so we’ll go through the possible actions as you plough the waves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of your turns at sea involve trying to catch fish. Each depth has three card piles, called shoals, and the card backs indicate whether the card represents a small, medium, or large fish, with bigger fish generally taking larger dice values to catch. You pick which shoal you want to fish in and flip the top card. Some fish have effects when revealed, such as the whiptail stingray, which allows you to reroll one die. All fish have a value in “fishbucks” in one corner and a difficulty value in the other. To catch a fish, you’ve got to spend dice equal to the difficulty. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/pxl-20250729-192131139-1754491385922.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This makes flipping fish a calculated gamble, as it’s possible you won’t have enough dice to reel in whatever horror you’ve hooked. If you can’t, you get to take a dink card as a consolation prize, which generally gives you a small bonus like the shrimp, which reduces the difficulty of a fish by one. In addition, not all fish are created equal. Some have values that are significantly different from their difficulty, while others can have both good or bad effects on you or other players when caught. They also come in two flavors: fair, which are normal, real-world fish, and foul, which are body parts, repulsive mutants, occult creations and worse.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>They come in two flavors: fair, which are normal, real-world fish, and foul, which are body parts, repulsive mutants, occult creations and worse.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However you fare in the fish lottery, the process is almost always enormously fun. For starters, there’s the big reveal, not only with the anticipation of matching the difficulty against your dice but of seeing what kind of freakish thing you’re up against and enjoying the art. There may be a reveal effect to resolve, many of which affect all players or otherwise mix up the expected catching process. Then, you may have an awkward decision about whether you want to spend multiple dice on it, whether you even want it at all, or whether it’s better to sacrifice a die and take the relative safety of a dink draw instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spending days at port allows you to sell fish for their value and buy equipment. Rods, reels and supply cards all help your fishing efforts in various ways, and you can also buy additional one-use dice to roll, meaning you can land more and more difficult fish. But be careful with what you sell, because the value of your unsold fish is your score at the end of the game. You can also mount fish into one of three slots while in port, which multiplies their value by two or, in the top “prize catch” slot, three. Choosing which days to spend in port rather than at sea is a key strategic decision in which you’re torn between wanting better fish to sell or mount, and wanting to spend as much time on the waves for a bigger catch.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/pxl-20250729-192035419-1754491715291.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Landing foul fish generally leads to you drawing regret cards. Each of these has a numeric value between zero and three as well as a narrative tagline which varies from bleakly funny – “got a bad tattoo” – to seriously sinister – “partook of human flesh.” Depending on the number of regret cards you’ve accumulated, you may go increasingly mad, slowly reducing the value of fair fish, boosting that of foul fish and raising the maximum number of dice you’re allowed to use in a day’s fishing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s a major catch. While the number of cards you have is public knowledge, the values on them are not, and the player with the highest total value at the end of the game must discard one of those precious mounted specimens and the multiplier that goes with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dice aren’t just spent on catching fish but can also be discarded to allow you to fish in deeper waters, which have more difficult targets and a higher proportion of foul fish. This allows you to manipulate an overall strategic curve. You can save dice, stay in safe waters, maximizing the value of your fair fish and resting safe in the knowledge you won’t be the one discarding when the game ends. Or you can dredge the depths, catching more and more appalling abominations, revelling in the horror and crossing your fingers that you’ll have fewer bleak regrets than your fellow fishermen when the game ends. Or try to chart a course between the two extremes, adjusting carefully depending on other player’s decisions.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/pxl-20250729-192659428-1754492137500.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">On a tactical level, the game gathers momentum towards the finale. Initial fishing trips are fairly bland but as you begin to gain dinks, equipment, and a collection of fish, some of which can be eaten for an immediate ability, you can start to look for combo effects between the different cards. This snowballs as you get more and more of each, meaning you can pull off some pretty spectacular fishing turns late in the game, once you’ve learned to spot them. But each of these is laden with various risk vs reward decisions, most obviously that eating a fish means you no longer benefit from its value. In particular, once the regret deck runs out, additional regrets must be taken from other players, making for some very swingy turns. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are definite strategic and tactical choices of this kind in the game, it’d be overselling things to make too much of them. Fundamentally, this is a push-your-luck game where you’re eternally hoping for the highest dice rolls, the best fish card reveals, and for the fish-coin flips to always go your way. Experience and planning help, but anyone around the table can win, with that hidden regret value being particularly punishing. This cuts both ways, as it can make the game feel over-long at high player counts, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games"><u>hardcore strategy hounds</u></a> may find the game too lightweight to satisfy, but newer players will enjoy rolling with the punches in the knowledge that they’re in with a chance to win right up until the bitter end.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/pxl-20250606-212534925-1754492525443.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/92x8de?object_uuid=8372a7e5-a6bd-4935-b2a4-c3482f52e613&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAyKm?object_uuid=8372a7e5-a6bd-4935-b2a4-c3482f52e613&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Game Nerdz</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRypK?object_uuid=8372a7e5-a6bd-4935-b2a4-c3482f52e613&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Tettix</a></li></ul></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 6, 2025 4:12 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Given that our real-world deep ocean trenches are full of nightmarish life forms, horror fishing isn’t an especially new idea in games. However, rarely has it been delivered with such a delightful balance of horror and humor, nor strategy and randomness. The result is a game that’s simply fun, thanks to its engaging artwork and push-your-luck mechanics, and what it fails to deliver in demanding strategy, it makes up for in thrilling moments and entertaining discoveries. Your sinister fisherman alter-ego might be piling up the regrets from time spent on the waves, but you’ll sail home to port with little buyer’s remorse at all.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/deep-regrets-board-game-review-like-bringing-dredge-to-the-tabletop]]></content:encoded>
