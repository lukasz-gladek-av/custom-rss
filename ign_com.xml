            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 players aren't happy after EA and Battlefield Studios' changes to two of its most controversial cosmetics failed to live up to expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-to-alter-2-controversial-cosmetics-after-fans-accuse-ea-of-ai-generated-content-and-call-of-duty-ghosts-inspiration"><u>promises to address fan feedback</u></a> last week, the Battlefield community was quick to see how update 1.1.3.6 adjusted the Objective Ace skin and Winter Warning sticker when the patch went live this morning. The problem is the changes are almost too small to notice.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— DETONATED (@DETONATEDcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/DETONATEDcom/status/2018712937670627367?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 3, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s first take a look at Objective Ace. The skin drew criticism through Season 1 when players noticed it bore a striking resemblance to the Call of Duty: Ghosts logo, with both sharing even a few finer details, such as cracks and paint streaks. The Assault skin also caught flak related to the large white armor piece located on its chest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The updated version of the cosmetic received the more noticeable facelift of the two impacted, with its updated look now featuring new details and a slimmer design overall. Still, it’s not enough for the players who were expecting more significant changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“[I] think the damage has already been done,” one <a href="https://x.com/BABYBLUBERRYZ/status/2018723941251256755?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>player commented</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Why did they copy COD in the first place?” <a href="https://x.com/Negan259/status/2018713351526748283?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another added</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">AI Sticker Before VS After Patch <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Battlefield6</a> <a href="https://t.co/Srfjhp7ZHj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Srfjhp7ZHj</a></p>— Battlefield Intel (@BattlefieldInte) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldInte/status/2018666389972902043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 3, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Winter Warning sticker, on the other hand, was the center of controversy when players noticed details that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-fans-accuse-ea-of-selling-ai-generated-image-after-spotting-what-looks-like-an-m4a1-with-two-barrels"><u>suggested it may have been created using generative AI</u></a>. Battlefield 6 update 1.1.3.6 seems to have brought no change to its design, with its soldier finger placement and double-barreled M4A1 still plainly in view despite being two of the bigger talking points amongst fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been cause for concern for those who feel EA and BF Studios may have misled fans. However, the developers have since <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2018746377569013844?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stepped in</a> to say the timing relayed in last week’s patch notes, which promised to adjust Winter Warning with the February 3 update, was “incorrect.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The latest update notes communicated that a change would be made for the Winter Warning Player Card Sticker to bring it more in line with Battlefield’s visual identity,” a message shared today says. “This timing was incorrect. Winter Warning will be updated when Season 2 launches on February 17th.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear what the new version of the sticker will look like when it launches with Season 2 in about two weeks. For now, players have taken to social media to call attention to both the delay and the relatively small changes to the cosmetics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Show what ur doing with it," one <a href="https://x.com/DANNYonPC/status/2018746669802692706?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fan suggested</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Stop using AI generated Art and cosmetics and we will trust this statement and future ones," <a href="https://x.com/LordVonTiger/status/2018747014855430637?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another added</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-was-the-best-selling-console-of-2025-in-the-us-and-is-still-outpacing-the-nintendo-switch"><u>a strong start</u></a> when it released October 10, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S but has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/losing-steam-3-months-after-launch-its-time-for-a-check-in-with-battlefield-6-and-its-community"><u>faced backlash in recent weeks</u></a> as players hope for fundamental changes to how BF Studios is handling post-launch content. The fallout from a disappointing end to Season 1 reached a boiling point in early January, with the team eventually announcing that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-to-february-as-ea-tackles-community-feedback-with-an-extended-season-1"><u>Season 2 had been delayed</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following an extended Season 1, Season 2 will launch February 17.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The CEO of Take-Two Interactive has denied ongoing rumors that Grand Theft Auto 6 will be a digital-only release upon its initial launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Variety, which spoke to CEO Strauss Zelnick today ahead of the company's Q3 2026 earnings release. When asked if subsidiary Rockstar would delay the release of physical copies of GTA 6 until 2027 to avoid leaks, he replied, "That's not the plan."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rumors of such a physical delay <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/grand-theft-auto-6-may-not-have-a-physical-version-on-day-one-to-avoid-leaks-report-claims/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emerged late last month</a>, when an alleged insider industry source shared that Take-Two had no plans for a physical edition of the game at release due to concerns about physical copies falling into hands early and leaking online.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, the report suggests that physical copies could be delayed into 2027, or delayed just a few weeks, which would make Zelnick's answer somewhat unclear. IGN reached out to Take-Two to get more clarity on what his statement meant, and was informed that Zelnick's statement was denying any delay plan at all, not just a move to 2027 specifically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 is still set for release on November 18, 2026, a date that Zelnick <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-marketing-will-kick-off-this-summer-as-take-two-confidently-reaffirms-november-release-date">reaffirmed confidently to us today</a>, alongside plans for Rockstar to spin up its marketing machine this summer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto VI's November 19, 2026 release date is drawing nearer. And while the game has now suffered multiple delays, Take-Two Interactive is starting to sound more confident than we've ever heard them that this time, it's really happening. So confident, in fact, it's announced that Rockstar will be spinning up its marketing beats this summer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Take-Two's Q3 2026 earnings results, which were just released. In those earnings, Take-Two reaffirms that GTA 6 is indeed still planned for November 19, 2026. That on its own would be exciting news after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">two</a> separate <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">delays</a>, but even better is a sentence at the bottom of the release sent to IGN. "Our execution throughout Fiscal 2026 has been extraordinary and we are highly confident as we approach Fiscal 2027 – which promises to be groundbreaking for Take-Two and the entire entertainment industry – led by the November 19th release of Grand Theft Auto VI with Rockstar’s launch marketing set to begin this Summer. "</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's sounding pretty confident, to me! Speaking to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick earlier today, I asked him how he felt about the release date at this time, to which he replied, "I feel good about it. Very good about it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, we've asked Zelnick this before, and he said he felt "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">really good</a>" about the fall 2025 release date that was originally announced, ahead of two delays. So I asked him if this time was different in some way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course," he said. "Because any time you're getting closer to marketing beats, you're obviously in a place where your confidence level is as high as it can be."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 is one of the most anticipated games of all time, with many already suggesting it as a potential Game of the Year contender despite us not having seen any gameplay footage of it yet, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/increasingly-convincing-ai-generated-gta-6-gameplay-leaks-are-getting-millions-of-views-on-social-media">leaks and AI fakes</a> going viral all over social media late last year, and its delays having <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-the-gta-6-delay-also-delay-next-gen-consoles">potential industry-shaking impacts</a>. So far, we've seen two cinematic trailers for the game, which have shown the dual protagonists Duval and Lucia Caminos, and the setting of Leonida, Florida, including the infamous Vice City.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even without GTA 6, GTA as a franchise had a great quarter. It "vastly outpaced" Take-Two's forecasts, with GTA+ membership levels nearly doubling year-over-year. We asked Zelnick for insight as to the cause of GTA 5's excellent quarter, and he pointed to the Safehouse in the Hills update for GTA Online doing especially well. GTA 5 has now sold over 225 million units.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, Take-Two brought in net bookings of $1.76 billion for the quarter. The company is raising its expectations in light of a better-than-expected quarter on multiple fronts, with total annual net bookings expected to range between $6.65 billion to $6.7 billion, representing around 18% growth year over year. Take-Two expects that nearly half of its full-year earnings, which it will report next quarter, will come from its mobile business, Zynga.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
