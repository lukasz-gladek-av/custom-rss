"I know some fans have expressed concerns, but please rest assured, we’ll be able to deliver a proper, high-quality third instalment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The concern revolved around the suggestion that the scope of Part 3 might have been scaled back as a result of Rebirth's disappointing profits. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-failing-meet-expectations-launch-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-shoots-no3-us-charts-with-steam-debut">But Rebirth has enjoyed a comeback of sorts after debuting strongly on PC via Steam</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hamaguchi also took the opportunity to assure the community that development on Final Fantasy 7 Part 3 is going "extremely well," adding: "The game is shaping up nicely. A lot of the content is already playable, and the game’s direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now, the team is united around refining everything."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">RPG fans have been on the hunt for news about the next entry in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy  since its last installment, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a>, launched in early 2024. We know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-in-development"><u>development started as early as June 2022</u></a>, with Square Enix saying last year that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-hoping-to-release-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-finale-by-2027"><u>its goal was to see it launch by 2027</u></a>. Excitement for the third and final chapter in the trilogy grew even more when the team revealed that it had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-a-completed-story-at-square-enix"><u>completed its story earlier this year</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And though he was still being a little coy with the details, in a separate interview with German outlet <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/hamaguchi-ueber-das-schluesselwort-zum-dritten-teil-der-remake-trilogie-zu-final-fantasy-vii/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>JPGames</u></a>, Hamaguchi revealed that the "key words [...] that underpin the design philosophy and then the theme for each game" were "reunion" for Remake, and "bonds" for Rebirth. The third instalment also has a key term, but Hamaguchi's keeping that to himself for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In terms of development [of Part 3], we’re working on that right now," he added. "We’ve got builds running where you can actually experience what that theme is through the gameplay. And we know where we’re going with it. It’s looking like it’s going in the right direction, and we’ll keep working on it and make it even better. So hopefully in the near future we’ll be able to reveal some of that. </p><div id="best-mainline-final-fantasy-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3><h3>Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"And yeah, this is going to be the climax, the finale of the series. And we’re going to make it a suitable finale, a really great send-off for the game. It will be something ideally we hope will please fans, will delight the fans of this much-loved series, and really reward everyone for sticking with us to the end. So look forward to that. More information in the not too distant future. It’s all in safe hands!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Co-director Tetsuya Nomura similarly acknowledge he'd heard the cries for updates on Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iv"><u>Kingdom Hearts 4</u></a> earlier this month, and happily reported that development was “progressing really smoothly.” While we wait, you can read up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-we-will-not-cheat-with-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-airship"><u>why the Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 team “will not cheat” when it comes to Final Fantasy 7’s iconic airship</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

The tech experts at Digital Foundry have said their <a href="https://youtu.be/2v1ST5qMoaY?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>initial analysis of Borderlands 4 on PC</u></a> showed significant stutter problems, and advised against running the game on its ‘Badass’ graphics setting.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Responding to the increased stutter issues reported by PC gamers, Gearbox issued a statement on social media, below, calling on players to give the looter shooter 15 minutes of gameplay to continue to compile shaders in the background, by which time those stuttering issues should resolve. If that doesn’t work, Gearbox suggested manually clearing your shader cache via your video card manufacturer’s approved method. And, if all else fails, Gearbox pointed to its support ticket process.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We've received reports that some players are experiencing reduced stability after downloading today's update.</p><p>Stuttering issues should resolve over time as the shaders continue to compile in the background while playing.

But this process doesn’t appear to catch all the shader compilation that might have to be done during gameplay, causing stutter. At least, that’s the running theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox’s latest statement echoes previous advice it issued on Steam that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-asks-pc-gamers-to-keep-playing-for-at-least-15-minutes-after-they-tweak-settings-to-see-how-performance-has-changed-as-negative-steam-reviews-pile-up"><u>to me read like an effort to prevent players from making knee-jerk reactions to the game's performance as soon as they changed their settings</u></a>: “Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile. Please keep playing for at least 15 minutes to see how your PC's performance has changed.” This latest advice reads much the same to me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, some players are recommending traveling to certain zones in the game to brute force shaders to compile before moving on to what they actually want to do in-game. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>To expand on this: quit the game once after launching and relaunch it. Now travel into a zone and back out (Idolator Sol’s or a Vault will work) this should compile a BUNCH of shaders and start improving the smoothness. </p><p>Shader compiling is rough.</p></div>— Ki11er Six (@Ki11ersix) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ki11ersix/status/1971286391964434615?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without an updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.
