            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/every-noteworthy-character-in-gta-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A who's who of Vice City.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar may have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">delayed Grand Theft Auto 6 to May 26, 2026</a>, but the studio has surprised everybody with a new trailer loaded with story and character details. While we knew from the first trailer that GTA 6 would feature two protagonists, it mostly set the stage for a return to Vice City. But with the newest trailer, Vice City gets a little more full thanks to a bevy of new faces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While their full roles and personalities might still be a mystery, the new trailer and the updated official GTA 6 website shares just enough that we now have a rough outline of who some of these friendly faces are. So read on for every GTA 6 character we’ve seen so far.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Every Important GTA 6 Character We’ve Seen So Far</strong></h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Jason Duval</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/jason-duval-04-1746540363699.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Jason Duval. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first protagonist in our Bonnie and Clyde duo is Jason Duval, a man who’s looking for the easy life but can’t seem to catch a break. After serving time in the Army, he’s in the Leonida Keys working odd jobs for the local drug runners. The only thing keeping him going is his love for Lucia.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Lucia Caminos</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/lucia-caminos-06-1746540461266.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lucia Caminos. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the start of the trailer, we meet Lucia just as she’s released from Leonida Penitentiary, having served time after fighting for her family. We know her father taught Lucia how to fight from a young age and that their family moved to Leonida from Liberty City (GTA’s version of New York City). With Jason by her side, it seems Lucia has a plan to give both of them a new start towards a better life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like past GTA games, GTA 6 is led by a couple of streetwise toughs hoping to find the score of a lifetime. What’s unique is that unlike the trio from GTA 5, and the lone wolves of older GTA games, Jason and Lucia seem to genuinely love each other, and that might allow them to reach new heights – or fall even harder than past main characters.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Brian Heder</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/brian-heder-03-1746540941114.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Brian Heder. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Brian is Jason’s landlord and one of the aforementioned local drug runners in Leonida. By day he runs and operates Brian’s Boat Works and Marina, but this serves as a legitimate front for his drug business for which he hires Jason to act as some additional muscle. He sounds suspiciously like the actor Stephen Root, but Rockstar isn’t sharing its voice cast for GTA 6 just yet (we asked).</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Cal Hampton</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/cal-hampton-03-1746540562480.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Cal Hampton. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Jason’s friend and drinking buddy at The Rusty Anchor, Cal is described as having “casual paranoia” and seems somewhat prone to conspiracy theories… but also having a good time, so maybe it all balances out for him? If Rockstar’s penchant for American satire continues, we can expect Cal to exhibit some of the worst, if funniest, parts of Leonidian society.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Boobie Ike</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/boobie-ike-01-1746540641301.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Boobie Ike. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A local Vice City legend, Boobie Ike is now a legitimate entrepreneur and business mogul, a far cry from his life on the streets. Boobie runs everything from real estate, a strip club, and even a recording studio which he is using as a launch pad for a new music empire with his associate, Dre’Quan. Keep an eye out for Only Raw Records’ first hit.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Dre’Quan Priest</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/drequan-priest-02-1746540704532.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dre'Quan Priest. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Boobie, Dre’Quan is a businessman whose primary job is gangster and drug dealer. He’s hoping to use his partnership with Boobie Ike and the talents of his first music signing, Real Dimez, to promote himself to the Vice City elites. It remains to be seen how much of Dre’Quan’s ambitions will end up helping or hurting him in his climb up the power ladder.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Real Dimez</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/real-dimez-04-1746540816790.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Real Dimez. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Musical duo Real Dimez comprises Bae-Luxe and Roxy, high school friends who turned their street toughness into a hip-hop and social media career. They’ve signed on with Dre’Quan Priest and Boobie Ike to capitalize on the success of their first hit, DWNPLY, to become Only Raw Records’ breakout stars.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Raul Bautista</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/raul-bautista-04-1746540887820.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Raul Bautista. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It wouldn’t be Grand Theft Auto without a few criminal masterminds, and Vice City’s got theirs with Raul Bautista. A veteran bank robber, his tendency to up the stakes during a heist means that his crew often has to deal with more than they planned for. Maybe one of his best-laid plans will be something Jason and Lucia sign on for to get their big break?</p><h3 data-cy="title3">And More (Various Gangsters, Cop in Body Armor, Influencers)</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/ambrosia-03-1746541721202.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Leonida Man and Woman. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of faces that get a brief appearance in the trailer who aren't named. From various gangsters who Lucia and Jason seem to have run-ins with, to, of course, cops looking to bring down Vice City's criminals. And in between are all manner of partying influences, gun store owners, and other Leonida denizens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the main characters we know about so far in GTA 6. Has anyone caught your eye yet? How do you think the two protagonists will stack up to past GTA anti-heroes?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/all-time-wrestling-all-or-nothing-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pile drivers, clotheslines, and – time travel? In the board game All Time Wrestling: All or Nothing, an immensely wealthy wrestling fan from the future uses the power of time travel to bring together some of the most iconic wrestlers from the past, present, and future to compete against one another. The game, designed by Mohamed Al Qadi and Jad Yammine and published by Cation Arts, offers players a fun time, whether or not you're familiar with pro wrestling and its pantheon of characters.</p><div catalogid="d55f387f-9d55-466a-a73e-98f67d3532b9" id="218897"><div id="218897" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>All Time Wrestling: All or Nothing Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyone who grew up in the ‘90s like I did knows the WWF (as it was called back then, before the World Wildlife Fund won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE#Lawsuit_and_renaming_(2002)" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trademark dispute</a>) was all the rage among kids. So, while I opted to get my spandex fix with Power Rangers, I still had enough folks in my circle to know who the Macho Man and the British Bulldog were. While ATW’s subject matter may not be a big selling point for me, its balancing act of managing your resources and knowing when to push your luck kept me coming back round after round.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In ATW, much like in actual wrestling, players attempt to exhaust and weaken each other, with the end goal being to pin their opponent and take home the win. Each selectable wrestler – including legends like Macho Man Randy Savage and the British Bulldog, alongside ATW original characters – features unique abilities and varying levels of health and stamina, which adds some lovely variety to the game and helps keep matches exciting from one to the next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat plays out with the player holding “initiative” playing cards from their hand and rolling dice to deal damage. Successful hits push the Momentum Track in that player’s favor, replicating the crowd hyping up the wrestler. The higher the momentum, the easier it becomes to land hits and gain other bonuses, which incentivizes continued aggression. Initiative only switches when an attack misses, the defender blocks, the defender uses their once-per-game “Reversal” ability (which instantly stops the combat), or the attacker voluntarily passes to regain some stamina and cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between the different attack bonuses and the ability to combo cards together, there is a pleasant amount of depth and strategy in ATW without being overly complex. What I found most interesting, though, is how <em>initiative</em> is handled – it's done in a way I haven’t encountered in other games before. I really enjoyed this “press your luck” approach, and it made managing my hand of cards, stamina, and momentum more exciting. It often left me with a tough choice: do I push hard and risk leaving myself in rough shape for a chance to cinch a pin, or do I pass and forfeit the attack to try and weather the next assault, hoping I’ll be in a better position to strike back?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of cards, this is perhaps where my biggest issue with ATW lies. Instead of relying on text, the game heavily uses symbols and icons to denote things like damage, stamina requirements, special attributes, and other modifiers. As a general rule of thumb, if a game <em>can</em> employ icons, it should – so long as they are both readable and not overwhelming. Luckily, I never found there to be too many icons to decode in ATW, but the readability leaves a lot to be desired.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The action cards, which you use the most, feature colorful artwork of various wrestlers performing everything from jabs and punches to German suplexes and signature moves. However, this can make picking up on all the symbols more of a hassle than it should be – especially if you're on the receiving end and viewing them upside down or from a distance. More than a few times I encountered situations where finishers or dice modifiers were missed, or cards were mistaken for others, due to duplicate artwork being used for attacks with different stats. Perhaps it’s because of my long history with games like Magic: The Gathering, but I wish the information was presented atop a slightly opaque background, rather than directly over the art. It’s not a finisher on the game, but it’s certainly a bit of a jab to the chin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The core game box offers players plenty of value and flexibility, providing not only standard 1v1 matches but also a tag-team-based 2v2 mode, a cage match variant with new rules, and a solo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign</a> mode that lets you improve your wrestler as you progress. The automated systems in solo mode are fine, but admittedly, as someone who has never quite gotten into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board games</a>, I spent far more time playing against others than diving into ATW’s campaign.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I personally prefer the more intense, head-to-head two-player experience.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for tag mode, the inclusion of specialty partner abilities and the ability to tag in my friend to continue combos added an extra layer of choice and strategy. Still, it didn’t quite hit as hard as the core 1v1 mode. Even with the new tag mechanic, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this mode simply adds more players at the expense of having more downtime, since only one attacker and one defender are active at any given time, with partners outside the ring. It’s still fun and led to some awesome team-up moments with friends, but I personally prefer the more intense, head-to-head two-player experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those wanting to dive even deeper into the All Time Wrestling universe, the creators continue to release new expansions – fully compatible with existing content – that add legends like Sgt. Slaughter and the Junkyard Dog, alongside new game modes like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four-player</a> free-for-alls and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-three-player-board-games">three-player</a>-specific Triple Threat matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All Time Wrestling is one of those games worth checking out even if the wrestling theme doesn’t grab you. With games clocking in at under 30 minutes for two players and around 45 minutes for tag teams, it's a great filler during game nights or something compact enough to take to a bar. I’d love to see this system adapted for other themes – like a shonen anime (think Dragon Ball Z) or something Power Rangers-inspired. There’s a surprising amount of depth here, while still being approachable for players of varying board game experience – even those coming to it purely for a love of wrestling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With All Time Wrestling, Cation Arts delivers a dramatic and faithful representation of the wild history of wrestling in a package that will delight fans of head-to-head games, regardless of whether you know what a DDT stands for or not.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aX2mge?object_uuid=1d3f2b21-42ca-46ea-a29d-eca2d1e54d62&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1e3g?object_uuid=1d3f2b21-42ca-46ea-a29d-eca2d1e54d62&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Cation Arts</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJpeE?object_uuid=1d3f2b21-42ca-46ea-a29d-eca2d1e54d62&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at The Wrestling Collection</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 6, 2025 7:15 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">All Time Wrestling is one of those games worth checking out even if the wrestling theme doesn’t grab you.
