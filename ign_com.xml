            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-protocol-gets-a-pseudo-revival-in-star-resonance-later-this-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/blue-protocol">Blue Protocol</a> may have been shut down last year, but it lives on in a new form now with Blue Protocol: Star Resonance. Publisher A Plus unveiled the new MMORPG today, and it's set for launch sometime in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blue Protocol: Star Resonance is an anime-inspired MMORPG, with action combat and an open world to explore, targeting PC on both Steam and the Epic Games Store, as well as iOS and Android. Currently, the game is set to launch in Europe, North America, and Latin America sometime in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/free-to-play-mmorrpg-blue-protocol-star-resonance-coming-west-in-2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gematsu</a>, Blue Protocol: Star Resonance was previously only announced for China. It was licensed to Bokura, the developer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namcos-cancelled-mmorpg-blue-protocol-is-coming-back-as-star-resonance" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">after the closure of Blue Protocol</a> and picked up some members of the original team in the process. Now, Star Resonance looks to be heading to new territories.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You'd be forgiven for thinking Blue Protcol: Star Resonance is the original Blue Protocol, as the gameplay and world <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI_qVWHiHnQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">look very similar</a>. The original Blue Protocol was a collaboration between Amazon Games and Bandai Namco. The MMORPG went live in Japan and was planned for a worldwide release. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-protocol-preview-living-out-my-anime-action-dreams">IGN even previewed it in 2023</a>, calling it "gorgeous" and "cool."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then in 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/worldwide-release-cancelled-for-amazon-games-live-service-mmo-blue-protocol">Bandai Namco announced it was cancelling the worldwide launch</a> and would discontinue service for Blue Protocol by January 18, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of Blue Protocol, and both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world,” Bandai Namco said in a statement at the time. “We have worked hard to prepare for the release; however, we have come to the conclusion that it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cut to now, and Blue Protocol: Star Resonance bears all the hallmarks of Blue Protocol. There's the anime-inspired aesthetic, action combat, character customization, and community events. This, in essence, may just be the return of Blue Protocol for those who were interested in seeing it arrive in the west.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this news might feel like seeing the ghost of old games past, it might be some good news for anyone who didn't get the chance to try Blue Protocol before its closure. Maybe the second time's the charm? We'll know for sure when Blue Protocol: Star Resonance arrives sometime this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
