            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It includes 10% raises, restrictions on mandatory overtime, and more.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Quality assurance workers at Raven Software, one of the developers of Call of Duty, have officially ratified their first union contract with Microsoft three years after they first unionized.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a press release, the union shared several highlights of the new contract, including a guaranteed 10% wage increase over two years plus additional raises through merit and promotions, significant restrictions on mandatory overtime, layoff protections, expanded disability accommodations, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“After more than three years of organizing and bargaining, seeing it finally pay off feels incredible,” said bargaining committee member and QA tester Erin Hall in a statement. “From day one, we made it a priority to include every voice in the room, and the contract we came out with reflects what we need—better pay, real career paths, and protection from burnout. It’s a contract that actually values the work QA does. I’m proud of what we accomplished, and I hope it shows other game workers that organizing works—and it’s worth it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raven Software's QA union has had a long road to get here. The inciting incident for its unionization was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-lays-off-at-least-a-dozen-raven-software-quality-assurance-contractors">a round of layoffs back in December of 2021</a> as a part of a studio restructure instituted by then-parent company Activision Blizzard. The following day, employees <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/raven-software-walkout-activision-blizzard-solidarity">walked out to protest the cuts</a>, garnering the support of employees at other Activision Blizzard companies. Raven Software continued to strike for weeks before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-strike-fund-350000-management-finally-replies">the company finally responded in January</a>, only to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-activision-blizzard-buy-acquisition-acquired">acquired by Microsoft</a> just over a week later. By the end of the month, Raven QA workers had announced the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/raven-qa-employees-activision-blizzards-first-union">formation of Activision Blizzard's very first union</a>. While Activision Blizzard <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/raven-software-qa-workers-strike-union">declined to recognize the union voluntarily</a>, the group <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/raven-software-qa-workers-vote-unionize">won its union election the following May anyway</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, a number of other groups under Microsoft Xbox have unionized, both within Activision Blizzard and in other subsidiaries such as ZeniMax. This past May, QA workers at ZeniMax Media <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-fallout-doom-qa-workers-union-reaches-tentative-contract-with-microsoft-after-nearly-two-years">reached a contract agreement with the company</a>, while many others are still at the bargaining table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The story behind KojiKOG's endless scream.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One pro fighting game player's reaction to losing at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</a> was so dramatic that it's going viral on social media and already showing signs of becoming a meme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve been looking at game-related sections of social media today, chances are you have stumbled across a picture or clip of Japanese player Kazuyuki 'Kojikog' Koji, mouth open in a scream and clutching his head, while fellow player Goichi "GO1" Kishida looks on with a mixture of concern and bemusement. A couple of stills were even shared by EVO2025’s official X account.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">A story in two parts.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Evo2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Evo2025</a> <a href="https://t.co/eo2pkg2Psg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/eo2pkg2Psg</a></p>— Evo (@Evo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Evo/status/1952120436810285238?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The player in question is KojiKOG, an esports pro from Japan who mainly specializes in fighting games like Street Fighter, the King of Fighters and Guilty Gear. This weekend, he took on fellow Japanese player GO1 (Goichi) in the Winners' Semi Final for Fatal Fury: City of Wolves at the Evolution Championship Series 2025 (EVO2025).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although GO1 won both rounds (and went on to win overall), the fights were very close. Upon being defeated, KojiKOG clutched his head with his mouth open in a continuous scream worthy of… well, Edvard Munch’s painting The Scream. This dramatic emotional outburst, plus GO1’s bemusement, resulted in a number of meme-worthy shots.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I swear to God I’m not making fun of this dude but NO ONE HAS EVER LOOKED LIKE THEY SUFFERED LIKE THIS IN HUMAN HISTORY <a href="https://t.co/JekIbl1F0a" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/JekIbl1F0a</a></p>— kayos (@kayos_o) <a href="https://twitter.com/kayos_o/status/1952115459094143151?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">KojiKOG eventually snaps out of his losing pose and can be seen chatting to GO1 and tidying up. It is clear from this that he was acting. However, shorter clips on social media have caused some who are unfamiliar with KojiKOG’s antics to worry that he was having a real breakdown. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The End of EVOgelion <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EVO2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#EVO2025</a> <a href="https://t.co/fZOHd1HmNF" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/fZOHd1HmNF</a> <a href="https://t.co/Ht0vzmHXd3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Ht0vzmHXd3</a></p>— Keith Ace (@Keith_Ace_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Keith_Ace_/status/1952151406544339104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">KojiKOG is known for being a bit of a comedian, often doing his screaming pose and pulling funny faces in interviews (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/82PbS1khSxY?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like at EWC2025</a>). His dramatic reaction to losing this weekend was likely a reference to when he previously faced off against GO1 at EVO15. As seen in the video below, he did a similar screaming pose- puzzling the Japanese commentators as his antics weren’t well known back then.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>10 years ago, GO1 went to EVO for the first time and won 4 side games—Melty Blood, Dengeki Bunko, UNI, and AQUAPAZZA, beating KojiKOG in the finals</p><p>Today, they meet again on the EVO main stage, recreating the 'leg cutting incident' meme <a href="https://t.co/p5whu1GNLB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/p5whu1GNLB</a> <a href="https://t.co/rfPVn2HJXg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/rfPVn2HJXg</a></p></div>— HiFight(ハイファイト) (@HiFightTH) <a href="https://twitter.com/HiFightTH/status/1952147416892981325?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Commenting on this, legendary pro fighting game player Daigo Umehara mused that KojiKOG’s reaction was like a character in the SAW movies having their leg cut off. This is why many Japanese fans colloquially refer to KojiKOG’s dramatic pained reaction as the “leg cutting incident” and the like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although KojiKOG lost against GO1 at EVO2025, he came in joint fifth place overall, winning 80% of his matches in Fatal Fury: City of Wolves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West. She has also written about Japanese culture and movies for various publications.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/fatal-fury-pros-dramatic-reaction-to-losing-at-evo-2025-goes-viral-but-it-was-actually-10-years-in-the-making]]></content:encoded>
