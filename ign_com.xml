So, in the meantime, the publisher said it had instructed Nintendo to pull the game instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Limited Run said it had faced Switch 2 backwards compatibility issues with a number of its games originally released for Switch 1, and while a recent Switch 2 firmware update had improved this situation for the "majority" of its titles, GEX Trilogy was still impacted. The company had then tried to solve the issue with a patch — and it is this patch the developer is still waiting to be approved for public release. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Since we do not have clarity on when GEX Trilogy on Switch 2 will be fixed in firmware, we submitted our own patch last week to correct the issue," Limited Run <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/limitedrungames.com/post/3lrxtpyajy22t" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>. "Due to the Juneteenth holiday, patch approval this week is delayed, but we expect to be able to issue the patch early next week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In the meantime, we have asked Nintendo to remove the game from the Switch 2 eShop. Thank you for your patience as we work with Nintendo to resolve these issues."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The publisher has suggested players check to see if other titles from the company are indeed now running as intended — a list of which you can see below: 
</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Clock Tower: Rewind</li><li>Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection</li><li>Tomba! Special Edition</li><li>River City Girls Zero</li><li>A Boy and his Blob Collection</li><li>Rocket Knight Adventures</li><li>Shantae</li><li>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Retro Collection</li><li>Xtreme Sports</li><li>Trip World DX</li><li>Felix the Cat</li><li>Rendering Ranger R-2: Rewind</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Gex Trilogy is a collection of all three of the wise-cracking, snarky gecko's platform adventures: Gex, Gex: Enter the Gecko, and Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko. It released for PC, PS5, Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, Xbox Series, and last-gen consoles on June 16. The original Gex first released all the way back in 1995 for the 3DO and later ported onto the original PlayStation, the Sega Saturn, and PC. It spawned sequels in 1998 and 1999, but publisher Square Enix hasn’t released any new entries since — hence the excitement for this remaster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Switch 2 is off to a strong start, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/has-switch-2-been-a-failure-so-far-for-non-nintendo-games-the-numbers-paint-a-mixed-picture"><u>with 3.5 million consoles sold</u></a>, but an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/has-switch-2-been-a-failure-so-far-for-non-nintendo-games-the-numbers-paint-a-mixed-picture">analysis on the console's launch week sales paints a mixed picture of how well games <em>not </em>made by Nintendo are now selling</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/possessors-gives-you-demon-magic-legs-and-plenty-of-fast-action-to-enjoy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Wield a computer mouse like a whip.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since developer Heart Machine burst onto the scene with its hyper-stylized 2D action game Hyper Light Drifter, every effort from the studio comes with the promise of visual splendor and tight gameplay, and Possessor(s) is no different. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If Hyper Light Drifter is Zelda-like, then Possessor(s) is the team’s take on the Metroidvania. Although their dev team will probably get mad at me for calling it that, as they prefer the original genre term of “search-action.” Regardless of which label you prefer, you’ll find the genre’s familiar hallmarks here. Possessor(s) drops you in a big open map full of powerful demon enemies and branching paths that aren’t all open to you just yet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Heart Machine’s past games with stylized, but masked or hooded, heroes, Possessor(s) is led by a cast of beautifully hand-drawn characters whose stories I’m curious to learn more of. Set in a fictional, Japan-inspired, city, the player controls Luca, who survives a devastating, apocalyptic event. But only just barely. She awakens to find herself without her legs, which were damaged during the attack. Luckily (or not), she makes contact with a demon named Rehm, who offers her the classic devil’s bargain. She can get her legs back, but only if she helps him get revenge on some unnamed but powerful demonic forces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, Possessor(s) feels heavily inspired by urban fantasy anime. Shows like Jujutsu Kaisen come quickly to mind as Luca and Rehm explore a ruined metropolitan city and fight off demon-possessed everyday objects like haunted searchlights and demon fridges. This extends to Luca as well. While she’s now powered by demon-magic legs, her weapons are also everyday objects. Things like kitchen knives or even a computer mouse she can wield like a whip.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this combines into a fast-paced action-adventure. Combat feels rapid-fast, which is great because there are a lot of enemies to cut through. And running through the devastated city, or jumping and grappling over obstacles, also feels fast and great, which is a plus because I get the sense this is a pretty big game. The portion of the map I played already felt quite large and I only played a 20-minute demo.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Possessor(s) Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"> Mechanically, I wouldn’t say Possessor(s) upends the search-action genre, or at the very least not in the early portion of the game I saw. But both narratively and in the design there’s tons more that I’m interested in learning more of. Possessor(s) has moments where the camera pans out into the ruined city, highlighting a cinematic sense of scale that Heart Machine has explored before in games like Solar Ash. And even in my short hands-on time there was a lot of dialogue and exposition between Luca and Rehm. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also likely more to the RPG element that I haven’t discovered yet. Luca’s character menu seemed to show empty slots for a variety of weapons and upgrades – way more than the couple I found during my demo. And having only been given a glimpse of the map, which was primarily a lot of abandoned and destroyed office buildings, there’s clearly a lot more under the hood in Possessor(s) than what I saw. I’ll be keeping an eye on this one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
