Is it his latest creation, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach (a game we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review"><u>rather enjoyed</u></a>), or would be it be one of his earlier creations? I would be willing to bet a large portion of folks would immediately think of Metal Gear Solid and the gravelly tones of David Hayter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-2025-sale-top-deals-live"><u>Prime Day</u></a>, the Nintendo Switch version (which will also run on the Switch 2) of the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 is the lowest it has ever been at only $16.99 – that's a whopping 58% discount.</p><p id="get-the-deal"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Get the deal">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1 (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="3566e46b-444b-47d6-b918-d96c51fe8444" id="224505"><div id="224505" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1 (Switch)</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>The Nintendo Switch Version of Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This collection contains a bunch of tactical stealth goodness from the original Metal Gear Solid that first called the PlayStation home, and its PS2 follow-ups, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, in addition to plenty of other goodies. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These three games alone are packed with memorable gaming moments, such as the emotional conflict between Boss and Snake in MGS3, to the back-of-the-box Codex number in MGS, that it’s hard to count just how many there are. Even if you are only familiar with Kojima from his newer games, for this sale price, even if you are only slightly interested or intrigued, you can’t go wrong trying this series out. If you are a longtime fan, you already know how good these games are. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just ask yourself, is having these games with you on the go worth the price of less than it costs to go see a movie and get some popcorn? Heck, even if you already own it on another platform, for 16 bucks, why not get another copy?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a note only Metal Gear (MSX), Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, Metal Gear (NES), and Snake’s Revenge are on the cartridge, with the other games requiring a download. </p></div><p id="more-prime-day-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More Prime Day deals">More Prime Day Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Day is one of the best times to buy pretty much anything.
