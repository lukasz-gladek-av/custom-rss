            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Publisher says Tencent deal closure still "imminent."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has celebrated a fresh set of financial results that it says has been driven by a "strong performance" for its Assassin's Creed franchise. But while there's an update on sales figures for 2023's Mirage, there's no new figure for how this year's Shadows has sold. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The French publisher's latest earnings report, published this morning, covers the company's performance over the first half of the current year: April through September. Last week, Ubisoft delayed the publication of these results at the last minute, prompting speculation that something had gone wrong with the company's big Tencent deal — though there's no suggestion of that today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has framed the results in a positive light, with net bookings for the past quarter "above expectations" and up 39% year-on-year. "The outperformance was driven by stronger-than-expected partnerships," Ubisoft noted, "and was supported by a robust back-catalog, both highlighting the strength of the Group's brands."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One back catalogue game seemingly doing very well is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, the series' return to a smaller, city-based adventure that launched a couple of years ago. Today, Ubisoft announced a new 10 million sales milestone for the title, and said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-mirages-saudi-backed-valley-of-memory-expansion-looks-a-generous-free-side-quest-though-not-one-many-fans-would-have-asked-for">its recent Saudi Arabia-funded free update</a> had received "very positive" feedback from fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But on the sales performance of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, the franchise's blockbuster feudal Japan entry launched in March, Ubisoft was less clear. Without providing a new sales total, Ubisoft simply said the game had "benefited" from the launch of its New Game+ mode and recent Claws of Awaji expansion, which seems obvious. The company then pointed to the game's upcoming Switch 2 launch as an oppurtunity for it to "reach a broader audience." Back in July, Ubisoft said Shadows had surpassed 5 million players, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-suffers-mixed-results-as-assassins-creed-shadows-hits-5-million-players-while-rainbow-six-siege-x-struggles">that its performance had been in line with expectations</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of Assassin's Creed, Ubisoft noted that Rainbow Six Siege's cheating issues were continuing to temporarily impact "activity and player spending versus expectations," following the game's previous move to an essentially free-to-play model.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft still expects to finalize its $1.16 billion deal with Chinese conglomerate Tencent in the near future, company boss Yves Guillemot said, noting that "all conditions precedent have been satisfied." The transaction will secure funding for Vantage Studios, Ubisoft's new self-contained subsidiary in charge of its biggest brands, including Assassin's Creed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Guillemot revealed that more of these companies, termed Creative Houses, will be detailed in January — a point at which the Tencent deal should presumably be sorted. After this, the future shape of the company should become clear, following years of internal turmoil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These Creative Houses will be autonomous, efficient, focused and accountable business units, each with its own leadership, creative vision and strategic roadmap," Guillemot concluded. "This Group-wide transformation reflects our ambition to renew how we create and operate in order to deliver great games for our players and lasting value for our partners and shareholders."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The sequel to Mutant Mayhem is still due out September 17, 2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First released back in 2020, The Last Ronin features a dystopian world in which all but one of the Turtles have perished, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-last-ronin-tmnt-game-god-of-war">drawing inspiration from God of War</a> among other works. It written by original creators Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, who said it was based on an outline from a story in 1987.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Last Ronin was a big success for the Turtles, earning the story a sequel featuring a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-last-ronin-sequels-new-generation-of-turtles-comic-con-2023">new generation of turtles</a>. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-the-last-ronin-is-perfect-for-a-tmnt-game">Last Ronin video game</a> is also in development, although we haven't had an update on it for some time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last live-action or live-action / animation hybrid Turtles movie was 2016’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, which flopped at the box office. Successful animated Turtles movies, including 2023’s Mutant Mayhem, followed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paramount has reportedly drafted in Neal H. Moritz, the producer of The Fast and the Furious and Sonic movie franchises, to lead this new Turtles charge in a bid to “fully unlock its potential,” THR said.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Movie, TV Series and Game</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Given the success of the Sonic films, you can see why Paramount would want to get the producer responsible to repeat the trick with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In January, Paramount hailed the success of the Sonic movie franchise after Sonic the Hedgehog 3 helped it pass $1 billion at the global box office. 2024’s Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which stars Keanu Reeves as Shadow, made nearly half a billion dollars during its theatrical run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It feels like early days for this new era of Turtles films, and there’s no indication when the first movie will come out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
