The casting call also dropped a hint about when filming will begin, saying the network would only "consider children who are aged 9-11 in April 2025" and listing the filming dates as 2025-2026 in the UK. That would track with Warner Bros. Discovery's previous announcement that the show would debut sometime in 2026. Daniel Radcliffe, who played Harry Potter, has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/daniel-radcliffe-doesnt-think-hell-cameo-in-upcoming-harry-potter-tv-show"><u>he likely won't appear in the show</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upcoming Harry Potter TV series <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-tv-series-officially-announced-for-max"><u>was officially announced last April</u></a> and is said to be a "faithful adaptation" of the novels by J.K.

Variety noted that “Rowling herself has become an obstacle to the future of the franchise because of the author’s anti-trans public statements,” and <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/fantastic-beasts-franchise-dead-jude-law-eddie-redmayne-1236193808/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jude Law has said Fantastic Beasts is likely dead</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, according to Haddad, Hogwarts Legacy’s blockbuster success gave Warner Bros. the confidence to make a major Harry Potter push. “The rest of the company was very curious about what we helped to unlock with Hogwarts Legacy last year,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Warner Bros. enjoyed a mega hit with Hogwarts Legacy, its gaming business has endured a tougher time this year following the disastrous launch of Rocksteady’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</u></a>.
