            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-series-is-definitely-not-done-insists-io-interactive-ceo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"They will be maybe in different shapes, but there will definitely be more Hitman in the future."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">007: First Light. Project Fantasy. MindsEye. IO Interactive has a lot going on in the coming days, months, and years. But one key franchise of theirs has been conspicuously quiet: Hitman.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not that IOI is doing <em>nothing </em>with Hitman — it did <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-hitman-co-op-mode-with-stone-and-knight-is-in-the-works-at-io-interactive" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just announce that a co-op mode is in the works</a> for the games and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-world-of-assassination-elusive-target-sees-mads-mikkelsen-reprise-iconic-casino-royale-role">Mads Mikkelsen will reprise his iconic Casino Royale role as an Elusive Target</a>. But as for new Hitman games, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-franchise-on-hiatus-as-io-interactive-focuses-on-james-bond-game">franchise has officially been on hiatus since 2023</a>. Updates aside, it seems like IOI might be getting a touch too busy to give Agent 47 more major work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I asked Hakan Abrak, CEO of IO Interactive, if that was the case when we sat down for an interview this past weekend following the reveal of 007: First Light. And he reassured me that Agent 47 was still on active duty.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Hitman series is definitely not done," Abrak said. "We're not done with Hitman. IO has been synonymous with Hitman, despite the other IPs we have done. We absolutely are proud, grateful, and happy with Hitman. But obviously doing another new IP, Project Fantasy, and doing Bond, it takes a lot of our resources and time. But as you saw, we announced the Hitman co-op, which is a big dream of mine. And they will be maybe in different shapes, but they will definitely be more Hitman in the future."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My question to Abrak was sparked by our prior discussion of the differences between Agent 47 and James Bond. Though IO Interactive's espionage pedigree is certainly what led to the studio being trusted with the Bond license [to kill], the two heroes are quite different in practice. Bond leans more toward action, with Agent 47 preferring stealth and disguise. And while Bond certainly has a classy sense of humor, the Hitman games are renowned for being... well, pretty silly! Agent 47 dresses up in a flamingo mascot suit at one point, for Pete's sake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So will 007: First Light still have that Hitman flavor? Yes, said Abrak, but it will have a tone all its own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It is very, very important to get the humor right. In Denmark, we love dark humor and the silliness because it takes away from the seriousness of being an assassin. Bond is different. Bond, the humor is first of all very British. And the humor there is to support the energy and his personality, which is much more front and center. So I would say less silly. It's not flamingo disguises, as you said, but still entertaining."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Abrak continued: "And it's a game that plays differently. It's emphasizing more action, for sure. And the structure of Bond is more like it's breathing more. Like there are more linear parts where you have the spectacle moments and exotic vehicles. And then we also give space in Bond to open up a bit and breathe a bit. So you have definitely glimpses of IO Interactive, as you would know from Hitman games as well, but it's more front foot. It's less of an analytical mind, chess play, where you sit and meticulously plan. All the clockwork things in Hitman where if you do this or do this, where Bond is more impulsive, more reckless sometimes. It's more like he's just taking things and acting and handling it more as they arise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So it's a different dynamism, because we want to make something that feels true for a Bond fantasy. So it's definitely not a re-skin of a Hitman kind of thing, but I feel that people will see IO Interactive, that is a game made by Interactive, but they will also see that this game is something else. It's something that's true to what we are hopefully going to deliver 360, an ultimate Bond experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll be publishing our full interview with Abrak later this week, including discussion of not just Hitman, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-isnt-part-of-the-james-bond-film-canon">also 007: First Light</a> and upcoming IO Interactive-published game MindsEye. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-spot-shigeru-miyamoto-missing-from-mario-kart-world-credits-but-it-isnt-too-much-of-a-surprise<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World's credits don't feature Nintendo's most famous designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of Mario himself. But as fans who complete the game spot Miyamoto's absence, others have pointed to his changed role of late as something of an explanation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In days gone by, Miyamoto's name was synonymous with much of Nintendo's gaming output. From Donkey Kong to Nintendogs, Pikmin to Pokémon, Miyamoto was in the credits for dozens of games each year. Indeed, video game credit tracking website <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/36620/shigeru-miyamoto/credits/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mobygames</a> has 20 credits for Miyamoto in games released within 2000 alone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Miyamoto's role has changed over the years, and increasingly so within the past decade after he adopted the more supervisory role of Creative Fellow at Nintendo in 2005. Once a familiar face during Nintendo Direct broadcasts, Miyamoto now most commonly appears in relation to the company's expanded reach beyond games — such as when there is news to share on Nintendo's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-bros-movie">Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, or its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/super-nintendo-world">Super Nintendo World</a> theme parks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Miyamoto's most recent game credits before the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/platform/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch are from 2024, where he is listed as a Senior Supervisor on Mario spin-off games Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership and Princess Peach: Showtime! And while Miyamoto is credited as a Supervisor on 2023's Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the company's last big Mario platformer, it was notably fellow Nintendo veterans Takashi Tezuka and Shiro Mouri who took charge of the game's development as its producer and director, respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, while Mario Kart 8 featured Miyamoto in its credits back in 2014, it's perhaps not surprising to see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> does not — and simply being the original creator of Mario isn't a factor. (Miyamoto wasn't credited for the more recent spin-off Mario Kart Tour, either.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another familiar name not in Mario Kart World's credits is voice actor <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/princess-peach-and-toads-veteran-voice-actor-says-nintendo-told-her-shed-been-replaced-on-switch-2-launch-day-as-mario-kart-world-released-without-her-in-it">Samantha Kelly, who discovered her 18-year tenure as Super Mario characters Princess Peach and Toad was over on Nintendo Switch 2 launch day</a>, when Mario Kart World released without her in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images.</em>
