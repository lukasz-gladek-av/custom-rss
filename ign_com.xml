The image on the Korean website essentially showed the same, but with one key difference: Odd Rock is missing, and a young Pauline is holding on for dear life to Kong's necktie.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/screenshot-2025-04-07-at-11-44-54-1744022715079.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">On the left is the usual key art; on the right, a young Pauline is holding onto Kong's necktie.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the first time Pauline's been acknowledged in any of the images, teaser trailers, or hands-on previews shown thus far, suggesting Nintendo was perhaps hoping to keep her appearance a surprise. Whoops!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More intriguingly still, Pauline's young age suggests Donkey Kong Bananza could be a prequel of some sort — although again, Nintendo's tight-lipped on that for now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think Bananza is on track to be one of the most gorgeous Nintendo games I’ve seen," we wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-first-hands-on-preview"><u>Donkey Kong Bananza first hands-on preview</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-april-7-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve got today’s top deals lined up and honestly, it’s a bit of a vibe. There’s a handcrafted MainGear rig that looks like it belongs in a design museum and crushes modern games, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon TCG</a> tin that leaves your pulls up to fate, and a Humble Bundle full of giant alien bugs and unapologetic chaos.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MainGear Custom RTX 5070 PC, Pokémon TCG, and a Skyrim Dragonborn Helmet</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Waiting on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders</a>? I've found a great deal on a Sandisk 256gb Micro SD Express card too . Oh, and if you’ve ever wanted to cosplay as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Dovahkiin</a> desk ornament, the IGN Store has something special. I think it’s a solid haul; useful stuff, actual value, no sketchy third-party sellers in sight (Although Amazon is getting a bit cheeky with their Pokémon TCG mark-ups). Let’s break it down.</p><p id="maingear-north-rtx-5070"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MainGear North RTX 5070">MainGear North RTX 5070</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218237"><div id="218237" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MainGear North RTX 5070</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this is one of the smartest ways to get your hands on an RTX 5070 without building from scratch or skimping on quality. MAINGEAR’s setup skips all the common bottlenecks — no mismatched parts, no airflow nightmares, no “good enough” corners cut. For $2,095, you’re getting a clean combo of a Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, 16GB of DDR5 RGB RAM, and a 1TB NVMe SSD, all assembled by people who care about things like cable management. It’s future-ready, quiet, and fast enough to leave your current rig feeling like a potato in comparison.</p></div><p id="pokemon-tcg-azure-legends-tin-5-p"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin - 5 P">Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin - 5 Packs</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218238"><div id="218238" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin - 5 Packs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This tin is pure Pokémon chaos in the best way. You get one random promo card—Kyogre ex, Xerneas ex, or Dialga ex—and five booster packs; 2 x <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a>, 1 x <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pull-rates-for-pokmons-new-stellar-crown-tcg-expansion-are-fantastic">Stellar Crown</a>, 1 x Temporal Forces and 1 x Obsidian Flames. It’s a fun, low-stakes gamble for collectors or casual players who want a shot at good pulls without needing to take out a second mortgage.</p></div><p id="humble-bundle-earth-defense-force-c"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Humble Bundle: Earth Defense Force C">Humble Bundle: Earth Defense Force Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218239"><div id="218239" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Humble Bundle: Earth Defense Force Collection</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pay less to get fewer items, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity Oceana.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">EDF is the kind of game where logic goes out the window and fun takes over, and this $25 Humble Bundle gives you the best of it — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/earth-defense-force-5">EDF 5</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/earth-defense-force-41-the-shadow-of-new-despair">EDF 4</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/earth-defense-force-world-brothers-2">World Brothers 2</a>, plus a ton of downloadable content. I think this is worth it just for the laugh-out-loud co-op mayhem alone, and it doesn’t hurt that part of the proceeds go to charity while you blast oversized bugs into space.</p></div><p id="sandisk-256gb-microsd-express-micros"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="SanDisk 256GB microSD Express microS">SanDisk 256GB microSD Express microSD Card</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218240"><div id="218240" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>SanDisk 256GB microSD Express microSD Card</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If your current microSD card loads like it's on a coffee break, or if you need to expand your <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-sony-and-more-japanese-game-companies-suffer-stock-market-plunge-as-trumps-tariffs-hit-hard">Nintendo Switch 2</a> storage on launch day, this one’s a serious upgrade. I want this SanDisk Express card purely for the ridiculous transfer speeds — up to 880MB/s read and 650MB/s write. It’s built for 4K video, gaming, and surviving every possible disaster short of lava, and it’ll likely outlive every other accessory in your bag.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-shining-fates-collectio"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collectio">Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218241"><div id="218241" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Shining Fates Pikachu V Box is a great grab if you’re chasing shiny cards or just really into oversized electric rodents. You get a Pikachu V promo, a jumbo card version for display, and four Shining Fates booster packs. It's pricey, but Shining Fates is out of print.</p></div><p id="the-elder-scrolls-skyrim-dragonbor"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Elder Scrolls Skyrim - Dragonbor">The Elder Scrolls Skyrim - Dragonborn Helmet - Replica</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218242"><div id="218242" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Elder Scrolls Skyrim - Dragonborn Helmet - Replica</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pre-order for September release</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skyrim-library-on-sale-amazon-spring-sale-2025">Skyrim</a> Dragonborn helmet replica isn’t going to protect you in battle, but it will absolutely level up your desk setup. At just under six inches tall, it’s small enough to display but detailed enough to show off. I think it’s a solid collectible if you’re still emotionally tethered to Skyrim and have no shame in displaying that fact proudly.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-shr"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shr"> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218243"><div id="218243" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-shrouded-fable-preview">Shrouded Fable</a> ETB is the kind of set that makes you feel like you’ve got your TCG life together.
