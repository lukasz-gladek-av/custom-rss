            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-review-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It only took an hour of playing Path of Exile 2’s early access version to know I’d soon be firing up an Excel spreadsheet and saying goodbye to all my loved ones for the foreseeable future. Just when I thought I was out, the heartless maniacs (in a good way) at Grinding Gears Games have pulled me back in with a sequel to one of my favorite action RPGs of all time – a game which has already consumed much of my life since it came out a decade ago. The gameplay, endgame mechanics, and insanely intricate buildcrafting all take massive steps forward, and even though it’s subject to many of the usual “early access jank” caveats and suffers from some seriously stingy loot drops right now, there’s already a lot to love about this fantastic, time-destroying ARPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per all the genre’s usual tendencies, you can expect to spend your time blasting your way through armies of enemies in search of loot, taking down big, gross-looking bosses, and teleporting back to town to sell off your spoils roughly every two minutes due to your insanely small inventory space. In its presently unfinished state, it takes about 60 hours of battling your way through the first three acts of the campaign (of a planned six) twice in a row (on a higher difficulty the second time) before you hit the impressively extensive endgame, where even more angry mobs and shiny gear waits for you. And although it has plenty of technical jank and placeholders labeled “coming soon” where features should be, the vast majority of my multi-day marathon to get there was overwhelmingly enjoyable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Needless to say, Path of Exile 2 doesn’t exactly rock the storytelling boat – it sticks with the usual tale of horrifying abominations which threaten to destroy the world and immortal beings treating mortals as pawns – but that doesn’t mean it’s boring or without the occasional twist and turn. Getting to know the cast of characters and unraveling the otherworldly culture and history featured in each act is a particular highlight. I grew quite fond of Alva, a treasure hunter who loves adventure almost as much as she loves making quick exits whenever danger shows up, and getting to know the Maraketh, a brutal group of desert survivalist nomads, was very compelling. We don’t know what the second half of that story has in store, so the jury’s still out on whether or not it’ll stick the landing, but so far it’s off to a decent, if not entirely original start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Path of Exile 2 plays it safe with the story, it swings for the fences when it comes to ambitious gameplay, and the result is one of the most irresistibly playable action-RPGs to-date. After picking one of the six classes currently available (Grinding Gear says there will be 12 eventually) you’ll start down the long, arduous path of making heads or tails of their incomprehensibly complex skill trees. They almost seem like they were designed to be sarcastically dense as you slowly piece together a build you like – it only takes one look at the main passive perk tree, which has over 1,500 perks to choose from, to realize you’re gonna be fogging up those nerd glasses quite a bit. Then you’ll bring those abilities and equipment to bear on all manner of zombies and weird lizard monsters in a relentless hunt for loot and XP that, if you’re as eager to smash the next fleshy pinata open to see what’s inside as I am, is prone to keep you up long into the night. Throw in the fact that maps are procedurally generated and offer a pretty high degree of replayability while also managing to not feel like they weren’t handcrafted, and you’re liable to lose yourself for the better part of a week like I did.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Each class offers a unique way to play that dramatically mixes things.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a plethora of gameplay improvements over Path of Exile 2’s predecessor that make slashing through hordes of monsters endlessly entertaining, including dodge-rolling that adds a much-needed skill component to keeping yourself alive, WASD support that makes movement so much better, and other quality-of-life improvements that bring Path of Exile 2 much more in line with its modern peers. But in a lot of ways it surpasses them, too, with action-packed combat that feels a lot less passive than, say, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-review"><u>Diablo 4</u></a>, where you might find yourself hypnotically using the same combination of abilities over and over again as you plow through enemies. You can certainly get to an insane level of power eventually, but the vast majority of the time enemies will at least put up a fight, especially during boss battles where you’ll need to learn your foe’s attack patterns to survive. This ends up making combat feel a lot more like a proper action game than most action-RPGs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It helps that each of the classes offers a unique way to play that dramatically mixes things up to a much greater degree than other ARPGs. For example, choosing the Dexterity-focused Ranger will have you keeping your distance, dancing around the map, and most importantly, focusing on your Evasion stat which gives you a chance to completely ignore attacks that land on you – but if you ever do manage to get hit by something big, like a boss, you’re toast. Alternatively, if you choose a Warrior, you’ll be running into close-quarters battle wearing the thickest armor you can find and focus on cleaving the enemy in two before they can whittle down your health. Meanwhile, the Mercenary trades a sword for a crossbow that effectively turns the entire adventure into a top-down shooter that feels very unlike any other character. For my part, I spent the majority of my time as a Witch focusing on a minions build that let my thrall do the fighting for me, so I often spent my time just supporting my undead homies and shouting words of encouragement. That’s a level of gameplay diversity I haven’t seen Path of Exile 2’s contemporaries achieve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between the eyebrow-raisingly complex passive perk trees, your skill and support gem loadouts, the Atlas perk tree and Ascendancy tree (which are two endgame trees with even more effects to consider), and your overall equipment loadout, there are about a dozen extremely convoluted systems to learn if you hope to master your character, and in this case that’s great news. When you decide to play them more than casually, ARPGs are all about burying your face into horrifyingly complicated menus searching for the most powerful possible combination of stats, and Path of Exile 2 delivers on this front even more than its predecessors. It might take a while (okay, actually <em>quite a long</em> <em>while</em>) to figure out how each piece of the puzzle works, especially if you’re diving in early before the hardcore crowd gets hold of it and creates step-by-step recipes you can follow, but doing so makes for an awesome time if, like me, you’re into that terribly nerdy business. The only thing that’s a bit irritating about playing the early access version now is that not every skill tree has been finished, so you might want to chase a specific build or power, only to find out that power is still just a twinkle in the designers’ eyes. That could, for example, mean you aren’t able to purchase support skills to complement your build and take it in a different direction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where Path of Exile 2 definitely falls short, though, is with its loot. That’s not because the items you get are bad (finding a sceptre that let my Witch summon even more undead minions was quite nice, for example), but because it’s incredibly stingy with them. The first issue is that there seems to be no protection at all in ensuring the loot that drops is geared towards your chosen class – and even if you find stuff that is, it’s often not good or won’t work with your build since you’ll frequently require highly specific items to improve upon it. I didn’t even see a single Unique (a powerful, curated tier of items) drop until I had played for over 60 hours, and when I finally did it was a bow that my magic-focused character had no way of using. You can always trade with other players for gear you need, but it still feels pretty awful to grind your face off and not see anything worthwhile come of it, especially if you’d rather not interact with other people.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I hope loot gets at least a little more generous during early access.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, while there are a few options for taking middling items and leveling them up with new perks and higher rarities to improve your chances, these don’t come close to fixing how anticlimactic loot drops often feel, and you’ll likely find yourself using your best items long after you’ve leveled beyond them for sheer lack of alternatives. None of this should come as a surprise from fans of the first Path of Exile, as loot has always been hard to come by there as well, but it’s really something I thought Grinding Gear might address in this followup. Obviously it’s been a successful approach with the audience Path of Exile has built, but in my book that’s a pretty big miss for an ARPG, where cool loot can be a major selling point. I hope the loot dial gets turned at least a little toward the more rewarding side of things during the early access period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you plan to jump in at launch, hopefully you really enjoy your first playthrough of Path of Exile 2’s first three campaign acts, because right now you’ll have to give them a second go if you want to reach the endgame content. That’s because, instead of finishing all six acts for the early access build, Grinding Gear focused on the first three and wisely directed the rest of its attention to fleshing out the endgame so that it can be finely honed for the full launch. That was a smart choice generally speaking, but instead of letting you beat the first half of the story and immediately advance to the post-campaign grind, it instead makes you play through the whole thing twice – with no changes in the second run aside from scaled-up enemy levels – before finally granting you access to the endgame. Even though I enjoyed the story, playing it all again back to back just to reach an arbitrary character level left a bad taste in my mouth and makes things unnecessarily repetitive at the moment. It’s especially weird that the second run, called “Cruel Mode,” isn’t actually harder – in fact, it was a whole lot easier since I knew what was coming and had a far stronger build. That makes the whole second playthrough pretty monotonous. Couldn’t they have just boosted our characters and equipment to the proper level instead?</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Isometric Action Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, once you do manage to progress into the endgame, you’re in for a good time: Path of Exile 2 is surprisingly fleshed out on this front despite being quite unfinished. The main course is the Atlas, a massive, procedurally generated map that lets you explore nodes to reach objectives, including mysterious merchants, hidden boss fights, and more surprises lying in wait – it’s kind of like Diablo meets Super Mario World’s overworld map in the best way. While very similar to the original’s endgame, this version expands and improves on virtually every aspect and has been a complete blast to explore. I’ve likely only just scratched the surface after more than a dozen hours with it, but I could already see myself dumping another hundred hours into this thing. Beyond that, there are trials that pit you against special objectives and challenging modifiers to unlock powerful rewards and progress down your Ascendancy perk tree, as well as an endgame boss that serves as the final gauntlet for Path of Exile 2’s most dedicated adventurers. It’s an impressive amount of content and quite well thought out, especially for an early access game, but that’s hardly surprising given the first Path of Exile’s decade-plus of lessons learned while building upon its own endgame content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, a robust endgame hasn’t saved Path of Exile 2 from much of the usual jankiness that comes with early access games. I saw everything from the minor stuff, like framerate hiccups, to the extremely infuriating stuff, like that time a patch removed all of the skill gems, support gems, and the best weapon from my inventory, all but destroying my build and forcing me to grind much of it back. Per usual, I recommend waiting to hop in if you’re the type of person to throw their controller out the window when things don’t work as intended, as playing in early access isn’t for the faint of heart and your prized loot could vanish in an instant. It’s a testament to how good everything else is that these issues didn’t completely turn me off from continuing to play. It’s also worth mentioning that Path of Exile 2 already looks and sounds much better than its predecessor, even if it still doesn’t look nearly as good as a AAA cohort like Diablo 4 – so it’s a notable visual upgrade, but nothing that blew my socks off.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">At its early access launch, Path of Exile 2 is already shaping up to be the sequel we’ve been waiting for. Everything from the refined fundamental action-RPG gameplay to the surprisingly fleshed-out endgame has seen major improvements, and the half of the story we’ve got so far shows plenty of promise, even if the setting feels a little generic in the realm of dark fantasy worlds. The downside of playing in early access, though, is that you’ll have to slog through all three acts twice to reach the endgame, the loot game needs some major tweaking to more consistently reward us with usable items, and some mild-to-severe technical wonkiness might take the wind out of your sails if things go awry – but it’s nothing that makes me concerned for the future of this expansive sequel. Even while we wait for 1.0, Path of Exile 2 is already a stellar way to lose dozens of hours and a clear leap forward for the series.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some of the frustration stemmed from Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League <em>not</em> being another Batman game from Rocksteady, despite being set within the Arkhamverse. The developer’s single-player Arkham series is much-loved by fans, with 2011’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/batman-arkham-city"><u>Batman: Arkham City</u></a> in particular held up as one of the greatest, if not <em>the</em> greatest, superhero video games of all time. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, on the other hand, is a live service third-person shooter in which Batman is a villain. Soon after the game's February 2024 release, publisher Warner Bros. admitted <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms"><u>the failure of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League contributed to a $200 million hit to revenue</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In June, Warner Bros. told IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-will-complete-its-currently-announced-roadmap-but-warner-bros-quiet-on-what-happens-after"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League would see out its first year of support</u></a>, but declined to comment on what happens afterwards. Deathstroke and Season 4 are the culmination of that first year, which has also seen the release of DLC characters Joker, Mrs. Freeze, and Lawless. Is this it for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League? IGN has asked Warner Bros. for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg</u></a> reported that staff at Rocksteady were currently working on a director’s cut of the phenomenally successful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy"><u>Hogwarts Legacy</u></a>, while leadership pitched a return to single-player following its live service misstep.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/free-to-play-strategy-rpg-girls-frontline-2-exilium-launches-on-pc-and-mobile<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Direct a team of characters in tactical turn-based combat.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Girls Frontline series is back with the free-to-play strategy RPG Girls Frontline 2: Exilium, which recently launched on PC and mobile. It introduces a new cast of characters and fully 3D maps while building on the groundwork laid by its predecessor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not familiar with the franchise, this is a sequel to the 2018 free-to-play mobile game Girls Frontline. It introduced a war-torn future world in which much of humanity has died, and they now rely on androids called Tactical Dolls, also known as T-Dolls or Dolls, to fight their battles for them. Players took on the role of a commander in charge of Doll combat teams, known as echelons. The first title spawned a manga and multiple anime series, and now the sequel follows in their footsteps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Girls Frontline 2: Exilium picks up 10 years later and features significant gameplay evolution. You still play as the same commander from the first game, but your team has been disbanded and you are now a bounty hunter. You’ll need to recruit new Dolls to form a squad and lead them in turn-based combat as you try to uncover the truth behind a growing conspiracy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat has gotten a big overhaul. The original featured a 2D map that you would move echelons across to engage enemies, at which point you’d enter combat that was based on where characters were placed within a formation. Girls Frontline 2: Exilium is fully 3D with tactical combat, and you take direct control of each character to move them across the map and execute commands.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dolls are anime-style personifications of a wide variety of real-world weapons and come equipped with those weapons, including handguns, submachine guns, assault rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles, and shotguns. Each weapon has been created in 3D, is viewable from any angle, and can be displayed in your personal weapon gallery. You’ll also be able to apply different skins to your weapons, giving you some customization options for your collection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters are grouped into classes that define their combat role. Bulwarks are your classic tanks, acting as frontline fighters who can provide defensive buffs to your team. Sentinels are your primary offensive characters, focused on dishing out as much damage as possible. Vanguards can help provide damage too, but their biggest advantage is their high mobility, which allows them to set up flanking maneuvers on enemies. And finally, Supports provide healing or buff their teammates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each character is weak to one element and one ammo type, so you need to be careful how you build each of your combat teams. You don’t want them all to be weak to the same attacks. Enemies have these weaknesses too, so you’re incentivized to build a team capable of capitalizing on a wide range of weaknesses to turn combat in your favor.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/05/combat-page-2-1733425496620.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike its predecessor, Girls Frontline 2 allows you to move characters freely around the battlefield during combat and find objects to take cover behind. When a character is behind cover, damage against them will be dramatically reduced. But hitting them with attacks they’re weak against will drain their Stability stat, and once that reaches zero, their defense will be broken and they’ll no longer get the benefits of being behind cover. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That means you need to be strategic about how you use each of your characters. Since enemies are weak to an element and an ammo type, it’s possible for one character with the right combination of attributes to hit both weaknesses with one attack. That drains Stability even faster, which quickly breaks enemies' defenses and leaves them susceptible to devastating follow-up attacks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of combat, you can also spend down time with your squad members in the Refitting Room or Dormitory. Both offer full 3D interactivity and show off the game’s non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) anime art style. You’ll need to recruit new characters to expand your squad, and Girls Frontline 2 is celebrating release by providing in-game rewards that can help.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/05/official-launch-rewards-overview-1733423919008.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can get a rundown of all the goodies on offer in the image above, including codes you can redeem and rewards from multiple events.
