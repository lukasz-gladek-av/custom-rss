Is it scientific? Not really. But have fans posted evidence of other N64 classics they believe are now coming anyway? You bet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Super Smash Bros., other potential matches for upcoming N64 games include Donkey Kong 64 (hey, that'd be a good tie-in for the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>!), Ubisoft platformer Ratman 2, retro first-person shooter Forsaken, and bizarre platformer Glover.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I edited the images, arranged them, and made this video, and they fit perfectly. <a href="https://t.co/Bu1tvx0Sxq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Bu1tvx0Sxq</a></p>— Bet (@Betonoguau) <a href="https://twitter.com/Betonoguau/status/1942026877318680791?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The suggestion that Super Smash Bros. might be revived on Switch brings with it the exciting possibility of multiplayer capabilities — could Nintendo even rope up some kind of online play? Regardless, as fans wait for news on Switch 2's inevitable Smash Bros. incarnation (and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-on-his-working-style-the-changing-industry-and-unsustainable-aaa-development">series boss Masahiro Sakurai busies himself making a new Kirby game</a>), it's something to keep us all occupied.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, the Switch 2-exclusive Nintendo Switch Online catalogue of GameCube titles added Super Mario Strikers, adding to its launch roster of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and Soulcalibur 2.

Today marks the 25th(!) anniversary of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-ix"><u>Final Fantasy 9</u></a>, and Square Enix is going all out by… uh, launching a fan art project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If that falls a little short of your remake-shaped expectations, you're not alone. There was a lot of excitement about the much-discussed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-ix"><u>Final Fantasy 9 remake</u></a> after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/official-final-fantasy-9-25th-anniversary-website-set-tongues-wagging-on-potential-switch-2-nintendo-direct-remake-reveal"><u>Square Enix launched an official Final Fantasy 9 25th Anniversary website earlier this year</u></a>, and while the publisher has at least acknowledged Final Fantasy 9's special day with an "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFDDlEaUXxw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>anniversary special movie</u></a>" and a request to collect special memories from fans, that's pretty much it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Celebrating 25 years of Final Fantasy 9 today," said a tweet posted to the game's official X/Twitter account yesterday, July 6. "When a theatre troupe set out for a royal kidnapping, Zidane and Princess Garnet are thrown into an emotional adventure that's never left the hearts of those who've played it. What does FFIX mean to you?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, in a follow-up message posted today (July 7), Square Enix <a href="https://support.na.square-enix.com/ceform.php?id=441&amp;la=1&amp;h=cbf426fd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>invited players aged 13 and up in selected countries</u></a> to submit their FF9 fan art between now and the end of October. If selected, it will then be used on the Final Fantasy portal site, as well as official social network accounts.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— FINAL FANTASY (@FinalFantasy) <a href="https://twitter.com/FinalFantasy/status/1942056235010073084?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The X/Twitter account of passion project Final Fantasy 9: Memoria Project further stoked speculation earlier today by quote-tweeting Square's post, adding: "When are we going to tell them, Square Enix?"</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">When are we going to tell them, <a href="https://twitter.com/SquareEnix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@SquareEnix</a>? <a href="https://t.co/yLt8EQuWOD" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/yLt8EQuWOD</a></p>— Final Fantasy IX: Memoria Project (@MemoriaProject) <a href="https://twitter.com/MemoriaProject/status/1942104895882141808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's a far cry from what some fans had hoped for, not least because last year, Final Fantasy 14 producer Naoki 'Yoshi-P' Yoshida <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yoshi-p-thinks-a-final-fantasy-9-remake-would-take-more-than-one-game"><u>talked a bit about what a Final Fantasy 9 remake might look like</u></a>, warning it may not all fit in one game and so go in the direction of Final Fantasy 7 Remake. Earlier in 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-9-remake-rumors-fuelled-by-final-fantasy-14-director-yoshi-p"><u>Yoshi-P also announced Final Fantasy 9-themed extras</u></a> for the Collector’s Edition and Digital Collector’s Edition of Final Fantasy 14 expansion <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-dawntrail"><u>Dawntrail</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, the game's social media and Reddit communities have been full of shocked players commenting on the lack of news. "This CANNOT be it bro," <a href="https://x.com/ThePrinceMagus/status/1942069129847988416" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a> one. "The remake. Announce the remake," while another <a href="https://x.com/Chelseapaul23/status/1942060055550931434" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>: "At least confirm or deny the remake rumors plz."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The 25th anniversary is a big milestone and announcing it would be the best right now.
