Alien Earth's Noah Hawley is producing with It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Rob Mac starring and producing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I love about the Far Cry game franchise is it’s an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of Fargo is a variation on a theme,” said Hawley. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I’m excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The plan is for each season of the show to take on a new setting, similar to the games with Mac in the starring role. Details on the release date or content are still under wraps, but the games have given us everything from Montana, USA to the Himalayas and cults, insane dictators and pirates, so there's plenty to work with.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realized," added Mac, who also worked with Ubisoft on Apple's Mythic Quest, where he played a game developer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created. And through it all, my FX family continues to lift me up with their constant belief and support."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Upcoming New Video Game Movies and TV Shows: 2025 Release Dates and Beyond</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial.
