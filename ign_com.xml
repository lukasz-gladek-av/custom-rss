The emergence of a playlist for 10v10 might be what has most frothing at the mouth, though, as it offers bigger lobbies across many of Black Ops 6’s Multiplayer maps. Included in the list of maps is Nuketown, a map that is already notoriously chaotic in 6v6 matches, so expect even more chaos when hopping in for 10v10. While the standard Nuketown 24/7 playlist option will remain, fans can also now enjoy a new Stakeout 24/7 playlist.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/ss-0d3fffebfd9343ff4233a87967a6f63cc81757a5-1920x1080-1730718138609.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 patch nerfs Recon and adds 10v10 playlist.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another highlight involves an additional nerf for Recon, which has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-nerf-a-perk-so-overpowered-some-call-it-a-wallhack"><u>a common complaint from players</u></a> for weeks. The Perk combo bonus gives players a few advantages in combat, including the ability to briefly see enemies through walls after spawning. The effect previously lasted for a whopping two seconds, with many drawing comparisons between it and unofficial cheats like wallhacks. It didn’t take long before Treyarch brought down that timer to only 1.5 seconds, and as promised, that’s now down to only one second with today’s patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Multiplayer regulars will notice that they are no longer able to exit the map in Lowtown, too, with other more general changes tackling stability and XP earn rates. Zombies received a number of tweaks as well, including fixes for a few glitches and a patch for a Tactical Raft exploit that was being used to make the vehicle airborne on Terminus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s Black Ops 6 patch is smaller than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-november-patch-notes-detail-spawn-logic-fixes-and-assault-rifle-balance-updates"><u>some of the others we’ve seen this past week</u></a>, but that’s only because Treyarch is on the verge of dropping <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-revealed-details-on-maps-weapons-and-more"><u>a gargantuan Season 1 update</u></a> next week. We learned more about the inaugural season of content just yesterday, with the team promising that more Multiplayer maps, Zombies additions, and a revamped Warzone will arrive next week. Even more goodies will come with a mid-season refresh in the future, too, with Ranked Play also set to drop later this month.</p><div id="black-ops-6-tier-list-best-guns-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Black Ops 6 Tier List: Best Guns Ranked</h3><h3>Black Ops 6 Tier List: Best Guns Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 got off to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record">a great start</a> when it launched for PC and consoles October 25, and we think its success is deserved.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-call-for-change-to-going-first-mechanic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"One advantage, however, is that you can concede faster."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> adapts the beloved card game into a speedier experience more fit for mobile, but players can't get their heads around one rule change regarding going first and are calling on developer Creatures Inc. to change it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At its simplest, the Pokémon TCG works by players attaching energy to their Pokémon to do attacks, with more energy resulting in bigger damage dealt. Pokémon are eventually knocked out and, once a certain number are defeated, someone wins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Card games commonly apply nerfs to the player who goes first so they don't gain an unfair advantage over what's essentially a coin toss, and the Pokémon TCG is no different. The player going first draws a card and can attach a single energy to a Pokémon, as normal, though isn't allowed to attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This balances things out a touch as, while player two is the first to attack and therefore do damage, player one can swing back the following turn with two energy and a bigger attack. But Pokémon TCG changes this mechanic by only allowing a card draw on the first turn, making the entire thing, some players believe, completely redundant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As we seem to all acknowledge going first in this game feels awful, and don't get me started about the one energy evolutions which benefit off going first," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gm5u0x/going_1st_sucks/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> user Seedler420 said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Can't we trade the possibility of attacking turn one, which in terms of gameplay doesn't make any sense, with the possibility of attaching energy turn one? This way the player going first would have energy advantage while the player going second would have the first attack."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The way Pokémon TCG Pocket works essentially gives the advantage to the player going second, as they have both the energy advantage and the first damage advantage. "It would feel a little better if we at least got to put energy on a card first turn," said one player in the comments. "It definitely feels bad," said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. did ask for feedback when it announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-passes-30-million-downloads-in-9-days">more than 30 million players had downloaded the game in just nine days</a>, so perhaps if enough people complain a change will come about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived October 30 as a streamlined and has players opening packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collecting cards</a>, building decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battling others;</a> a simple formula that immediately proved popular given it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">$12 million in four days</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. is keeping busy since launch as it has already added three events to the game: one focused on collecting, one focused on solo battles, and one focused on player versus player battles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first offers players a free Wonder Pick with the chance of pulling either a Meowth or Chansey alongside event tickets and Wonder Hourglasses, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-adds-new-rewards-and-missions-to-wonder-pick-event">its second part also released today</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, the solo battle event <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">let players take on a handful of water themed decks</a> for the chance of winning new promo cards including Lapras ex. And a PVP event was later added too, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gets-first-pvp-event-today">putting badges on the line in true Pokémon fashion</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you'd expect, players are looking to take the best decks into these events, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Mewtwo and Charizard are naturally dominating so far</a>. One outlier comes via Misty though, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/misty-has-become-pokmon-tcg-pockets-greatest-villain">whose heads or tails effect is driving many up the wall</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the collecting front, some players are focused on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-think-theyve-discovered-a-secret-way-to-get-super-good-cards">a conspiracy theory about crinkled corners</a> while most are swooning over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-swoon-over-mythical-god-packs-that-have-5-alternate-art-cards">mythical god packs that award five alternate art cards in one go</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-it-should-have-done-user-testing-and-internal-evaluation-earlier-on-concord<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has reflected on the disastrous launch of PlayStation 5 game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, saying it’s still learning when it comes to live service games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord, a live service hero shooter from Sony-owned Firewalk Studios, has gone down as one of the biggest flops in PlayStation history. Amid disastrously low player numbers, Sony hauled Concord offline just two weeks after launch. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown"><u>It eventually shuttered Firewalk and confirmed Concord wouldn’t return</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has proved a costly failure for Sony. Concord's initial development deal was around $200 million according to a report by <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kotaku</u></a>, which cited two sources familiar with the agreement. They said the $200 million was not enough to fund Concord's entire development, nor did it include the purchase of the Concord IP rights or Firewalk Studios itself. Kotaku's number aligns with an <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/sony-acquires-video-game-studio/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>earlier report</u></a> saying that ProbablyMonsters — Firewalk's original parent company — raised $200 million in 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all points to Concord being seen as an ambitious project that was expected to attract a large audience. Instead it launched to tepid reviews and low interest, prompting PlayStation to pull the plug within days of release. One estimate suggested it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"><u>only sold around 25,000 copies</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Midia Research analyst Rhys Elliott told IGN shortly before Concord was shut down: “Pivoting to live services is high-risk, high-reward venture, and the risk is heightening to levels that might not be worth it for many AAA console/PC publishers that aren’t already active in the space."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Concord Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent financial call, Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki said the company has learned lessons from both the record-breaking launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> earlier this year and Concord’s failure. On Concord specifically, Totoki said Sony should have run its development gates such as user testing or internal evaluation “much earlier than we did.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Currently we are still in the process of learning,” Totoki said. “Basically, with regards to new IP, of course you don’t know the result until you actually try it. So for our reflection, probably we need to have a lot of gates, including user testing or internal evaluation, and the timing of such gates, we need to bring them forward. We should have done those gates much earlier than we did.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The suggestion here from Totoki is that Sony should have noticed and reacted to Concord’s issues earlier in the development process, presumably so that it could have improved the game before launch.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/gettyimages-2153633660-1731080199508.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki. Soichiro Koriyama/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Totoki then went on to point fingers at Sony’s “siloed organization” and Concord’s release window, which may have caused cannibalisation. Concord launched in August, not long after smash hit Black Myth: Wukong hit PS5 and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have a siloed organization, so going beyond the boundaries of those organizations in terms of development and also sales, I think that could have been much smoother,” Totoki said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then going forward, in our own titles and in third-party titles, we do have many different windows. And we want to be able to select the right and optimal window so that we can deploy them on our own platform without cannibalisation, so that we can maximize our performance in terms of title launches. That’s all I have.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Concord launched into the ultra competitive live service hero shooter market following the failure of Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which contributed to a $200 million hit to publisher Warner Bros.’ revenue.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Helldivers 2 was a huge hit, while Concord ended up being shut down. We gained a lot of experience and learned a lot from both.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Sony senior vice president for finance and IR Sadahiko Hayakawa compared the launches of Helldivers 2 and Concord, saying lessons learned would be shared throughout the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We launched two live-service games this year,” he said. “Helldivers 2 was a huge hit, while Concord ended up being shut down. We gained a lot of experience and learned a lot from both.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We intend to share the lessons learned from our successes and failures across our studios, including in the areas of title development management as well as the process of continually adding expanded content and scaling the service after its release so as to strengthen our development management system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We intend to build on an optimum title portfolio during the current mid-range plan period that combines single-player games — which are our strengths and which have a higher predictability of becoming hits due to our proven IP — with live-service games that pursue upside while taking on a certain amount of risk upon release.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s live service push has seen mixed results so far. Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with an incredible 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, but other live service games have fallen by the wayside. In December last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward">Naughty Dog canceled a live service The Last of Us multiplayer game</a> and announced plans to focus on single-player games. Sony-owned developer Bungie, meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio">has suffered significant layoffs as a result of Destiny 2’s struggles</a>. The failure of Concord and the closure of Firewalk is yet another troubling development for PlayStation live service.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to the future, a number of PlayStation live service games remain in the works, including Bungie’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, Guerrilla’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">Horizon Online</a>, and Haven Studio’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgame$</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
