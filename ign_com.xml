We have reached out to EA for more details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioWare's decision not to release a DLC expansion may come as a surprise given its history with Mass Effect, Dragon Age, and Baldur's Gate 2. DLC episodes like Mass Effect 2's Lair of the Shadowbroker, the Dragon Age 2 prequel Leliana's Song, and the aforementioned Trespasser include some of BioWare's best-loved stories, offering a deeper look at their worlds and characters. But having finally finished its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade">decade-long journey with The Veilguard</a>, BioWare seems ready to focus its attention on Mass Effect, which has been largely on hold due to the studio focusing all of its efforts on shipping Dragon Age.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Modern RPGs</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, fans are busy digging into BioWare's latest RPG after Dragon Age's release on Thursday, propelling it to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-launch-beats-jedi-survivor-to-makes-it-eas-biggest-ever-single-player-game-on-steam">new highs for an EA game on Steam</a>. They have plenty to find even without DLC — estimates on <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/82090" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN sister site HowLongToBeat</a> suggest that it can take upwards of 88 hours to complete the main story while doing sidequests.

In each week of November, Fortnite will have a waterfall rollout of new map locations "revamped" by the artists, culminating in a finale event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chapter 2 Remix was revealed alongside a surprise billboard takeover of Times Square in New York City on Friday night with performances from Ice Spice and Snoop Dogg. (Ice Spice played "Princess Diana," and Snoop Dogg did "Who Am I (What's My Name)?", "Gorgeous," "Drop It Like It's Hot," and "The Next Episode.") The concert was also livestreamed simultaneously on Fortnite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Week 1 will have Snoop Dogg's touch, remixing the point of interest formerly known as The Agency as The Dogg Pound. It will also bring back the boogie bomb that triggers "Drop It Like It's Hot." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The in-game compound was at least partially inspired by his actual 30+ room compound – converted from a warehouse 10 years ago – located nearby the Los Angeles International Airport, his son Cordell Broadus told press after the event. "[There's a] casino, green room, basketball court, club... He's super creative in the physical world so we wanted to create that in the digital landscape as well," said Broadus, who started the studio Death Row Games with his dad in 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I just wanted the whole feel of my world being brought into Fortnite," Snoop Dogg added.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/01/snoop-fortnite-1730501683298.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Snoop and company are coming to Fortnite. Image source: Epic Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Week 2 will reveal Eminem's takeover of The Grotto as Spaghetti Grotto (a play on his Mom's Spaghetti restaurant in Detroit) with a "Rap God" machine gun that spits out lyrics to the 2013 song. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Week 3 drops Ice Spice's Y2K, New York-inspired Shark Island. Finally, Week 4 will pay homage to Juice WLRD, who <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/12/how-did-juice-wlrd-die-cause-of-juice-wrlds-death.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">died in 2021</a> at just 21 years old. Epic says it worked closely with his mother, estate, and label, Interscope to bring this to life. "Jarad always loved to play Fortnite – it was more than just entertainment for him, it was a way to connect with others,” his mother, Carmela Wallace, said in a statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new season will launch in three phases: on November 1, with The Prelude; on November 2, with the offical launch of Chapter 2, and on November 30, with The Finale, which will be a yet-to-be-announced in-game event. Any players who attend, however, will receive a free cel-shaded outfit. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're starting to see artists understand that gaming is an interesting and important place to meet fans where they are," said Nate Nanzer, VP of Global Partnerships, at a press event before the concert. "There's a lot of experimentation bringing music and gaming closer together." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Emily Levy, the director of strategic partnerships, said that artists see an 8.7% lift of consumption on streaming platforms after bringing music into the game. "Fortnite has become a necessary stop for artists on their tours, to engage on their campaigns and release cycles," she said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same event, Fortnite also announced kicks, a new cosmetic item; players will now be able to pick cusom shoes for their avatars to wear. The first will be a classic pair of Air Jordan high tops. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Leanna Butkovic is IGN's Editorial Project Manager.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
