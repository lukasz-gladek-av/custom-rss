While no release date is set yet, the team is teasing some new recipes, as well as new content to "update the world" (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-free-dlc-update-the-world-announced" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gematsu</a>).

In a post from March 2025, Level-5 boss Akihiro Hino described Inafune's departure as an "unexpected challenge."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fantasy Life i has taken off though, which hopefully bodes well for the rest of Level-5's roster of upcoming games. The studio announced a slew of games in a February 2023 Nintendo Direct, and while some have released, others are still in development. The yet-to-be-released games include some heavy hitters, like futuristic detective RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/decapolice">DecaPolice</a> and the next installment in the Professor Layton series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and the New World of Steam</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to see when and how those games land, at least Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time players have some more chill life updates to look forward to.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will soon let players drop into the shifting lands of Limveld, exploring and fighting for survival either solo or in groups of three. For the duos out there though, it sounds like you'll need to be open to a third.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first">IGN's interview with Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki</a>, the Nightreign lead discussed the choice to lean on solos and trios as the core experience options. When asked why there's no option for a pair of players to drop in together without a matchmade third player, Ishizaki said it was overlooked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that," said Ishizaki. "As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start," Ishizaki continued. "And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed. So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if you're playing with just your favorite duos partner, be ready to accept a random third into your lives. Who knows? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-elden-ring-community-hero">You might match up with someone pretty good at the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're playing solo, it does sound like Elden Ring Nightreign takes that into account. Ishizaki said the parameters of Elden Ring Nightreign "adjust dynamically depending on the number of players in that session," so lone wolves shouldn't be too overwhelmed in single-player.</p><div id="top-25-fromsoftware-bosses" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3><h3>Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll have to find and locate some self-revive options, which are incorporated for those opting for single-player. And if you're playing trios, well, that's apparently what Elden Ring Nightreign is built around. Whether duos support shows up or not, having an extra hand around can't hurt against some of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-features-bosses-from-dark-souls">the fearsome bosses</a> waiting in Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign is out on May 30, 2025 for PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox One and Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-preorder-restock-latest-amazon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most exciting trading card crossovers in years is nearly here. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy releases on June 13</a>. The upcoming set has been steadily building in hype since its announcement, and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/final-fantasy-x-magic-the-gathering-official-trailer"><u>new trailer</u></a> has since kicked the excitement up an extra notch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to get your hands on the set, you're in luck. There's a lot <em>out of stock</em> right now, but several of the elusive Final Fantasy MTG sets are now back in stock at Amazon, Walmart, and TCG Player, including the <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxJv3?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Play Booster Box</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the market price of that booster set has also surged this month. Only a few weeks ago you could pick it up for<a href="https://zdcs.link/akKXAr?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> <u>$164.99 from TCGPlayer</u></a>; it's now just over $179. Amazon had also restocked at $189.99 again (sold and shipped directly), up from the original listing's $144.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also the<a href="https://zdcs.link/av4LB7?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> <u>nine-booster Final Fantasy bundle (plus bonus cards)</u></a> for $89.92, despite still being available to preorder for <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w7pj?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$70 at Walmart</a>, alongside<a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwAZB?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> <u>single sealed boosters</u></a> that have risen from $7.99 to $9.19 as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what is "Market Price"? Those collecting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pokémon TCG</a> will be wildly familiar with the concept, but it's where retailers will take liberties with the "recommended" part of an MSRP, and list it for what they think folk will pay. Capitalism at its finest, I know, and for Final Fantasy MTG, "Market Price" is currently around $20-40 over MSRP, depending on what you're buying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you can stomach the cost, with the rest of the sets sold out and some singles already going for over $500, you'll want to lock in your preorders before everything vanishes faster than you can say Chocobo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prices in the singles market are looking remarkably high as well, with the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWY5y6?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">borderless version of Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</a>, currently sitting at $147.23, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2Oy5?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Surge Foil version</a> is at an almighty $599, the most expensive of the entire FF set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've already preordered, or are just on the hunt for rare singles, there are a few other clear standouts to keep an eye on in the coming weeks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes the gorgeous <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ7nB?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">borderless Kefka, Court Mage card</a>, shown off in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/final-fantasy-x-magic-the-gathering-official-yoshitaka-amano-teaser"><u>new MTG teaser trailer</u></a> from PAX East, and featuring longtime Final Fantasy artist, Yoshitaka Amano.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAgWvw?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCG Player</a> is good spot for a wide collection of single cards you can purchase and add to your deck without having to hope for a good pull. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also a good resource for figuring out how much your cards are worth once the new set is out, so if you pull any Surge Foil cards in your booster pack preorders, you might suddenly find yourself with quite the nest egg. But, it's also worth noting that prices change all the time, so some cards may change in value closer to release. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other highlights to look out for when opening boosters, or to consider buying standalone, include the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OYxn?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cloud, Ex-Soldier Commander card,</a> which costs $45.99 at the time of writing. That’s not surprising, given how easy it makes it for equipping other creatures you might have in play on the field. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there's also the full-art version of the <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xD8y?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Yuffie Kisaragi - Yuriko, the Tiger's Shadow</a>, currently just under $100. That’s due to both the card’s use as a Commander and its rarity, especially in that classic late 90’s FF7 art style. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s when you get to some of the special cards where things get extra expensive, though.

Willits said upping the player count to four for co-op made Operations missions too easy.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“As we’ve mentioned in a past interview, sticking to three players for PvE game modes (including Siege Mode) has to do with the challenge we’re able to provide, and specifically, the enemies we’re able to throw at you and your friends,” Willits said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Having four Space Marines together for a PvE mission simply made it too easy, and scaling enemy assaults to justify bringing a fourth player was too great of a challenge.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, Tom, aka <a href="https://ko-fi.com/warhammerworkshop" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Warhammer Workshop</u></a>, the modder behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/massive-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-mod-adds-lore-accurate-classes-a-weapon-previously-locked-to-campaign-and-even-new-operations"><u>Space Marine 2’s excellent Astartes Overhaul</u></a>, released a fantastic-looking 12-player co-op mod for the game. Gameplay footage, below, shows multiple players taking on a Tyranid Trygon Prime in a battle reminiscent of an MMO boss fight.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This was something players thought impossible, but the modding team not only broke through the 3-player barrier to hit 12-player co-op — with the support of developer Saber Interactive itself — but set to work improving it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Honestly, I’m just kind of in awe of Saber’s support for the modding community,” Tom told IGN. “None of us expected 12-player PvE sessions to be possible this soon — but somehow, here we are. Thanks to their generosity and trust, this huge leap forward is finally here, and it completely changes what we can do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, 12-player co-op makes a mockery of Space Marine 2's PvE balance, but it is there working on PC at least. This sparks the inevitable next question for Tim Willits: could Saber expand Siege mode to include more than three players in the future?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, no. “We don’t have such plans at this time,” he replied.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, it’s down to modders to improve upon Siege mode and the 12-player co-op they have already released. Tom told IGN the team is working on modes such as prop hunt, PvP inside operations, “massive” horde mode updates, and, perhaps most exciting of all, raid-style missions “with bosses that hit like trucks, take proper teamwork to bring down, as well as some other completely new mechanics.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 White Scars and Blood Angels Cosmetics</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Siege arrives as part of Patch 8 on June 26, and comes alongside two new DLCs for Ultra Edition, Gold Edition, and Season Pass holders: the White Scars Chapter Pack (a new Champion skin for the Assault class, three exclusive White Scars-inspired weapon skins for the Occulus Bolt Carbine, Stalker Bolt Rifle, and Combat Knife, and a host of cosmetic options and heraldry markings for their Successor Chapters), and the Blood Angels Cosmetic Pack (a number of new armour pieces to be equipped on any of the game’s playable classes, in addition to heraldry markings celebrating eight of the Blood Angels’ Successor Chapters).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, IGN reported on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ahead-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-patch-8-fans-believe-datamines-have-revealed-everything-from-the-new-class-to-a-new-much-wanted-melee-weapon-and-a-surprising-new-gun">various Space Marine 2 datamines that revealed potential upcoming content</a>, including a new class, a new melee weapon, and a new ranged weapon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot happening in the world of Space Marine 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive"><u>despite the surprise announcement that development of Space Marine 3 development had begun</u></a>.
