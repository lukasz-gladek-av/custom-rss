            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A moment of pure Serenity.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A strategy game dubbed ‘FTL in a Warhammer 40,000 skin’ was recently pulled from Steam, with its developer suggesting it may have been on the receiving end of a nuisance DMCA takedown from a troll claiming to be Games Workshop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Tundra Interactive posted a message on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2853590/discussions/0/685243800199705595/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Void War Steam forum</a> to say the game was “temporarily unavailable” after it had been pulled from Steam without explanation. The indie developer said it was working with Valve to “resolve” the issue, and pointed to Void War's continued availability on Itch.io.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Void War is often compared to both indie darling FTL and Warhammer 40,000, Games Workshop’s tabletop wargame set in the grim darkness of the far future — and it’s easy to see why.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Void War Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The gameplay looks incredibly similar to Subset Games’ hugely popular 2012 ‘spaceship simulation roguelike-like,’ and the aesthetic is very Warhammer 40,000. The voidships themselves look — in Void War’s official art — like Imperial Navy Vessels.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/ariokine-fleet-1769429015313.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Void War's aesthetic has been compared to Warhammer 40,000.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, some of the characters look like Space Marines. There’s an actual Psyker that’s called a Psyker. There are “Imperial Shrineworlds.” There’s mention of “Imperial astrogation authorities.” You get the idea.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/cover-art-1769429044382.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">This is not a Space Marine.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the takedown, IGN asked Tundra Interactive for comment, and it responded with something quite unusual. It said that it had received a takedown notice from Valve stating that Games Workshop itself had claimed copyright infringement. But here’s what makes this one odd: the only claiming information Valve provided the developer it said, is Games Workshop’s public-facing infringements inbox and the name “Mal Reynolds.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mal Reynolds is a name that will be instantly familiar to Firefly / Serenity fans, because that’s the name of the main character, played by Nathan Fillion in the beloved but short-lived sci-fi show. It seems unlikely that Games Workshop would have someone on its books named Mal Reynolds, and that it would come after Void War now, half a year after release on Steam. And it’s worth pointing out Void War is still up on Itch.io, where no DMCA takedown appears to have taken place.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Tundra Interactive's comment to IGN in full:</p><blockquote>We received a DMCA takedown notice from Valve stating that Games Workshop is claiming copyright infringement. We have not received any other communication from Games Workshop, and the only claimant information Valve has provided is Games Workshop’s public-facing infringements inbox and the name “Mal Reynolds,” which is unusual since that’s the main character from Firefly. We can’t independently verify who actually submitted the notice, and Games Workshop hasn’t responded yet to our email asking them to confirm or withdraw it. We’re following the standard DMCA process and will share further updates when we have confirmed information.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this may actually be a genuine DMCA takedown by Games Workshop, and there may well be a Mal Reynolds who's doing the dirty work. Perhaps there's an official FTL-style Warhammer 40,000 game in the works, and it's close to a reveal. Neither Games Workshop nor Valve has clarified the matter, and based on both companies' history when it comes to DMCAs, are unlikely to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of which leaves Void War off Steam and Tundra Interactive, like the Imperium Nihilus itself, in the dark. As for Games Workshop, it’s got plenty of official Warhammer 40,000 games in development, including Dawn of War 4, Dark Heresy, and Total War: Warhammer 40,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Lots, <em>lots</em> more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And no, Re-Logic doesn't even say that this is the last update anywhere — despite insisting Terraria had received its last update for years — but of course, with the team promising that crossplay will be "made available some time after 1.4.5," there's at least one more patch on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When Rockstar learned about the release of Terraria 1.4.5, they postponed GTA 6 in fear," teased one player in the YouTube comments.

The upcoming features were published on the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Upcoming_features" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terraria wiki</a>, and outline what to expect from 1.4.5 when it comes out. Expect official and final patch notes soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Terraria is pretty old at this point; IGN reviewed it 15 years ago(!) in 2011. Even then, though, we thought it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/05/25/terraria-review"><u>amazing, scoring it 9/10</u></a> and writing: "Though on the surface it looks like just another "me too" indie game seeking to ride the coattails of Minecraft's success, Terraria expands on the familiar sandbox gameplay with a greater emphasis on combat and adventure that proves very satisfying.

So, while other titles are expected, Undisputed will be February's main addition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Undisputed is expected to become available on February 3, for PlayStation Plus subscribers across all tiers from Essential upwards. As ever, it should remain available for a month, until March 3. We'll follow up with February's other PlayStation Plus Monthly games whenever Sony announces them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">January's PlayStation Plus Monthly games are of course currently still available to claim, including Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, Core Keeper and Need for Speed Unbound.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally launched in October 2024 for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, Undisputed is notable for being the first major licensed boxing video game in over a decade, since the EA-published Fight Night Champion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Developer Steel City Interactive's approach to boxing in Undisputed is on the right track, but there's a long road ahead of it," IGN wrote in its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undisputed-review">Undisputed review</a>, which returned a 6/10 score. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Its emphasis on realism, preparing for fights using RPG-like mechanics, and creating an adrenaline-filled experience in the ring are significant building blocks. Still, the fluidity of its gameplay animations and reactiveness of its commentators don’t come close to living up to the high bar that was set by the Fight Night series back in the late 2000s, and its realistic fighting can be a little dull if you’re in the mood for a KO instead of a TKO."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

(And while we're at it, the retailer has also recently <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN3XYy?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">restocked preorders for the popular TMNT Draft Night Box, now listed for $119.99</a>).</p><div id="229417"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="229417" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>TMNT Booster Box (30 Packs)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now down to just $124.99, and containing 30 of your finest Play Boosters (each containing 14 cards), this is a certified $84.71 in savings compared to its original $209.70 list price. That's also just over $4 for each booster ($4.17, to be precise), which is more than a couple of bucks off what you’d usually pay when buying them individually. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In comparison, the market price for these is still sitting around <a href="https://zdcs.link/aA8lWq?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$139, according to data at the trusted resale marketplace TCGplayer</a>. While this will likely continue to drop (fallen 45.71% in the past three months), you're certainly ahead of the trend if you pick up the preorder at Amazon right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, just a heads up, as it's important for those looking to buy: Amazon doesn't charge until dispatch (so your card won't be charged until closer to release on March 6. Plus, the retailer also has a preorder price guarantee, so if it drops even further or somehow goes<em> back up </em>in price, you can be absolutely certain that you're paying the lowest price possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magics-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-set-is-months-away-but-play-boosters-are-discounted-already"><u>This is also even better than the deal we saw just before Christmas</u></a>, and now even lower than the next best price at Amazon from earlier this month ($148.20). Although it does make you think, is the discount indicative of Wizards of the Coast’s expectations for the set? Let's hope not!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December, the price dropped to $159.99, bringing the Universes Beyond box of Play Boosters to around the standard price of a Universes Within box, but dropping even further to just $125, this seems like a mighty good deal for what is already looking like a very popular set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We saw similar drops for <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrJe7m?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spider-Man</a>, which would be a little worrisome if <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qm8mKK?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Avatar</a> hadn’t got the same treatment - and that set was great.
