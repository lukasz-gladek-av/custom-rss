            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve has outlined what's new in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dota-2"><u>Dota 2</u></a> patch 7.40 and provided a rundown of its latest hero, Largo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Dota is an ensemble cast, but keen observers looking through the collection of rogues, wizards, druids, and knights (not to mention two characters named 'ranger') may have noticed the absence of that most maligned of hero classes: the bard. At least, up until now," Valve <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teased</u></a>, before introducing Largo himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Largo is the shamanic head of the bardmonk order, and unlike bards that "sing about current events and chord changes," he "tailors every song to his exact circumstances, raising his allies' spirits or, if necessary, their foot speed as they run toward battle (or away). As a frog, his prehensile tongue has, shall we say, all kinds of tricks."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One such trick is his Catchy Lick, in which he targets someone, licks them, pulls them back a short distance, and applies a basic dispel. If they're an ally, he pulls them out of harm's way, and if they're an enemy, his tongue deals damage. By dispelling an effect from a target, Largo gets a brief health regen, too. He can also fire froglings that stomp the ground every second, dealing damage and ministuns, and minimize ally mana costs with his Croak of Genius skill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His ultimate skill is Amphibian Rhapsody. To be honest, with a name as incredible as that, I don't even <em>care</em> what it does, but for those wondering, it's essentially a mini-rhythm game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Largo gets ready to groove," Valve explains. "He is disarmed and his ability bar switches to three song abilities, each with different effects. Songs are only effective if strummed on the beat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Every time he strums successfully, he gains a stack of Groovin'. Each stack gives him bonus armor and reduces the mana cost of every song, but he loses a stack if he misses a beat. Stacks linger for a short duration when Largo's song ends."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As is tradition, the full patch notes are so huuuge they're too big to publish on Steam itself, <a href="https://www.dota2.com/largo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>but you can find them on the Dota 2 website right here</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Built with Unreal Engine 5, Legacy of Atlantis is due out next year as the franchise marks its 30th anniversary, with Catalyst set to follow in 2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some, quite naturally, suggest starting at the beginning makes sense given the anniversary, others are wondering if the announcement of the new game means the team has to go back and retcon some aspects of Lara Croft's story to make sure everything makes sense in the character's 30-year-old canon timeline.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are many theories about why the reimagining of TR1 is happening. Some say it’s only because of the 30th anniversary but I personally think it’s happening because it HAS to happen. We’re entering a new unified timeline where some things need to be retconned and some need to be reimagined," suggested X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/merychxrry/status/2000648075636011212" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Merychxrry</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This kind of reimagining will likely need to happen for every mainline game, but especially for these four story-heavy titles: Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness, Tomb Raider: Legend, and Tomb Raider: Underworld.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You might ask, 'Why not TR2-3 first?' Well, they’re not story-heavy. As much as I’d love to see them remade, we first need to unify these four story-focused games. Otherwise, it would take too long to reach them, and their stories would need to be retconned."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Tomb Raider Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Mery added, the order itself likely doesn't matter — "it could be 4 and 6 first, then Legends and Underworld, or vice-versa" — but since the assets for Legacy of Atlantis will be available first, "it shouldn't take too long to produce these games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That is actually genius!" <a href="https://x.com/Gamer_0wl/status/2000772462947037443?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a> one commenter, while another <a href="https://x.com/jaylennasir/status/2000792479189364981?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>: "Yes! This exactly!" "I feel like LOA is a test, like the [Resident Evil 2] remake was, <a href="https://x.com/itslooona/status/2000662255583494539?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>suggested</u></a> someone else. "TR1 was the safest choice they had for a reimagining because of its simple story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As game director Will Kerslake recently told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/tomb-raider-catalyst-picks-up-years-after-2008s-underworld-finally-continuing-lara-crofts-story-from-the-legend-trilogy-after-almost-two-decades/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesRadar+</u></a>, Catalyst fits into the timeline <em>after</em> the events of Tomb Raider: Underworld. The most recent games, known as the Survivor reboot trilogy — 2013's Tomb Raider, 2015's Rise of the Tomb Raider, and 2018's Shadow of the Tomb Raider — are still considered as part of Croft's origin story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the news of the recasting was a surprise for some, actor Camilla Luddington — who portrayed Lara Croft in the Survivor Trilogy — shared a bittersweet Instagram post about her time as the lead this week, saying <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lara-croft-survivor-trilogy-actor-camilla-luddington-passes-the-baton-to-alix-wilton-regan-who-takes-on-the-role-for-tomb-raider-catalyst-and-tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis"><u>she loved the fans and Croft will "forever be a part of [her]</u></a>." Alix Wilton Regan will now play Lara Croft in both Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis and Tomb Raider: Catalyst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, there's the upcoming Amazon TV show to consider. The live-action Tomb Raider Prime Video series, which will star <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/game-of-thrones">Game of Thrones</a> alum Sophie Turner, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-amazon-tv-show-will-reinvent-the-franchise-on-a-massive-scale">will “reinvent the franchise on a massive scale”</a> and will interconnect “live-action television series and video games into a unified storytelling universe.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
