            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But Village ran so well, the team got to porting.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">At the most recent Nintendo Direct, Nintendo fans were blessed with the news that not one, not two, but three modern Resident Evil games would be coming to Nintendo Switch 2: Village, Requiem, and Biohazard. But according to Requiem's developers, this wasn't always the plan. In fact, the team didn't originally plan to bring anything to the Switch 2 at all.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to me at Tokyo Game Show, producer Masato Kumazawa explains the story of how the Nintendo Switch 2 ended up with the three most modern Resident Evil games on their way to the system:</p><blockquote>The Switch 2 hadn't been announced when we started planning this game [Requiem], so of course it wasn't in the original plan. When the Switch 2 was announced we were able to start testing developing games for it, and we thought it would be great if we could bring the Resident Evil series to this platform. We started off with internally porting Resident Evil: Village to see if it would work well on the hardware, and it looked really great, so that gave us the confidence to add a Switch 2 version of Reqiuem to the plans, and that led us to the recent announcement where we confirmed not only Reqiuem was coming, but 7 and 8 would also be coming to Nintendo Switch 2 at the same time.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no surprise that Kumazawa is gassing up the Switch 2 port of his own game, but I played a brief section of Resident Evil: Requiem at Tokyo Game Show in handheld mode on the platform and...yeah, it looks pretty good! I asked him as a follow-up if there was anything unique about the Switch 2 version of the game, and his response that no, there isn't, "in a good way." It's just Requiem, on the Switch 2, able to be taken on the go. And though my sampling of this experience was brief, I'm optimistic from that short demo that Kumazawa's not just all talk here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We previewed Resident Evil: Requiem just last month, and you can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-hands-on-preview">read our impressions of what we've seen so far right here</a>. You can also check out the rest of my discussion with Nakanishi and Kumazawa, including continued efforts to get them to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-developers-are-still-being-coy-about-leon-kennedy">say something, anything, about Leon Kennedy</a>, and why the pair are struggling to figure out what qualifies as "scary" after all these years.

And to eager Resident Evil fans, me, and many of my coworkers, it seemed obvious that we were finally going to get a new trailer revealing Leon's official precense in the game, as a playable character or otherwise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that's not what happened. We did see a new trailer, but no Leon. And a preview build available at TGS, which I went hands-on with after my interview, was similarly bereft of Leon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When I brought up the strangeness of my expectations and the resulting Leon Kennedy drought to Nakanishi and Kumazawa, they just laughed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We will take on board this feedback," Kumazawa said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-shows-fresh-look-at-grace-ashcrofts-backstory-but-wheres-leon">Fan clamor for Leon has been going on for months now,</a> ever since the game's first trailer appeared to contain multiple teases for, at minimum, a Leon appearance. But rumors have since grown, with some suggesting Leon might show up in the game as a secondary playable protagonist alongside newcomer Grace Ashcroft. Nakanishi and Kumazawa have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">attempted to brush those rumors aside</a>, saying that Kennedy is a poor match for Reqiuem's less action-heavy tone, but the fervor has persisted anyway, and the two are stopping short of saying outright that we won't get to control him at all, even for just a little bit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given all this discussion, I asked the pair if they had any concerns that all the Leon nonsense was distracting from their attempt to position Grace as the game's star. But they're not worried. "We're always happy that people are interested in the game enough to speculate so much," Kumazawa said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If, then, the pair are so insistent that Grace is the new face of this Resident Evil story, could Reqiuem server as a sort of passing-of-the-torch between old and new Resident Evil? Not quite, Kumazawa says.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Although we don't have firm plans for the future storylines of later titles in the series, I still think passing the torch is probably going a bit too far, because we're not just going to wipe the slate clean completely in terms of the series lore and history. But at the same time I don't want to always have to just go back to the well of existing characters to create new games, which was part of the motivation to introduce Grace."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We previewed Resident Evil: Requiem just last month, and you can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-hands-on-preview">read our impressions of what we've seen so far right here</a>.
