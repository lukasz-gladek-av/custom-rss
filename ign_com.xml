It’s an enormous wave of tweaks and additions across all of Black Ops 6’s modes, giving players everything they could ever hope to know about how Call of Duty will change when Season 3 launches on Wednesday, April 2, at 9am PT.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Headlines from the Black Ops 6 Season 3 patch notes include crossplay tweaks that allow console players to individually adjust the player pool option in both ranked and non-ranked modes. It’s a change that, as Activision admits, could negatively impact matchmaking queue times for those who turn crossplay off, but it’s at least another option for those looking to tailor their experience to include – or exclude – players on all platforms, all consoles, or only their preferred console of choice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shotguns, meanwhile, are coming out of the Black Ops 6 update as big winners, as the weapon class is receiving a small blanket buff for nearly all weapons’ damage, range, and rate of fire. This is all in addition to brand-new content, including the return of classic Multiplayer map Firing Range, the reintroduction of the Kilo 141 assault rifle, and a familiar Scorestreak in the Death Machine.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zombies players have plenty to chomp down on, too, starting with the biggest highlight with its new map, Shattered Veil. The Raygun Mark II is also here with three new variants to explode zombies with, with fan-favorite Perk-A-Cola Double Tap also back from previous games. Both Multiplayer and Zombies have also been stuffed with a variety of bug fixes and adjustments to ensure the experience stays smooth when launch arrives.</p><div id="black-ops-6-tier-list-best-guns-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Black Ops 6 Tier List: Best Guns Ranked</h3><h3>Black Ops 6 Tier List: Best Guns Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Warzone patch notes get special treatment this time around, as Season 3 will soon usher in the return of one of the most important maps in Call of Duty history: Verdansk. Set to launch one day later, April 3, the Warzone Season 3 update mostly focuses on giving longtime fans a classic coat of paint that reverts some features back to their launch state from 2020. You can see our roundup of some of the biggest differences between modern and classic Verdansk <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-returns-to-call-of-duty-warzone-here-are-all-the-biggest-changes"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It means that Warzone will feel nostalgic in good and bad ways while still incorporating modern Call of Duty features like Omnimovement. Buy Stations, for example, now feature that OG, vertical UI design for a more streamlined purchasing process in the heat of battle but also come with added features, including a Redeploy All option. Veteran players will also notice that the Precision Airstrike will be much harder to dodge, as its mini-map notification has been removed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have removed the Precision Airstrike’s approximate path indicator on the mini-map in order to return back to how it worked in 2020, where part of its purpose was to surprise your enemies,” the patch notes explain. “We will monitor feedback, data and sentiment on this as we look to the weeks ahead.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 3 launches in just a few days. In the meantime, you can read up on Activision’s latest anti-cheat update <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-console-players-unlikely-to-be-cheating-theyre-just-killing-you-with-an-intel-advantage-activision-says"><u>here</u></a>.

They’ve managed to avoid detection throughout the years, using conflict and chaos to cover their tracks. With some new leads in play, however, their secrecy is no longer certain. Time to pick up the trail tomorrow with the launch of Season 03.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like always, stay up to date with what’s to come with our Season 03 launch, including details of new Multiplayer and Zombies Content and the latest balance adjustments, gameplay improvements, bug fixes, and more arriving tomorrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Multiplayer Maps</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Firing Range (6v6)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Firing Range makes its glorious return in Black Ops 6 in a faithful remaster of the fan-favorite map. Watch for crossfire down the long center Road as Operators fight for control of the vantage points in the Tower and the upper levels of the Shoot House and Garage. Shooting targets move back and forth on their tracks behind the Office and several other spots adding a useful diversion while preparing for the next fight. Avoid the center chaos by branching off to the Dirt Road, keeping your guard up against ambush as you pass the Storage unit along the way.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Barrage (6v6)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Revisit 1968 Vietnam as you follow Hudson’s clues surrounding one Summit Watch at the front lines of battle. The trees have been cleared and the landscape flattened to make room for this base housing an artillery battery in active combat. The area has taken hits with large chunks blown off buildings including the Command Center and Barracks, the damage opening new pathways through the map.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Nomad (6v6, 2v2)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Pantheon moles were in Afghanistan, too, when Woods fought there in 1986. Fight in the ruins of a fortified settlement commandeered for the ensuing battle, a parked missile carrier facing out over the valley where a convoy lies in ruins on the narrow road leading up to the map.</li></ul></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Multiplayer Modes</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sharpshooter</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Flex your skills in this classic Black Ops free for all party mode where every Operator is assigned the same Loadout which changes every 45 seconds. Each cycle introduces a new Primary and Secondary Weapon from scoped Sniper Rifles to akimbo Pistols, plus a new Dedicated Melee weapon and Tactical and Lethal Equipment.</li><li>Use everything at your disposal to eliminate enemies while unlocking bonus abilities for going on a streak:<ul data-cy="list"><li>1st Elimination: Increased movement speed.</li><li>2nd Elimination: Increased reload speed.</li><li>3rd Elimination: Increased sprint recovery speed.</li><li>4th Elimination: Increased ADS speed.</li><li>5th Elimination: Earn double score for eliminating enemies.</li></ul></li><li>Keep the streak going to unlock double score and make a run for the top three. When you’re taken out, respawn and build up those bonuses again. A short countdown precedes each weapon swap. Adapt and win.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Demolition</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Alternate between attacking and defending two bomb sites. The attacking team must destroy both bomb sites to win the round, gaining a time bonus after detonating the first site. All attacking Operators spawn with a bomb and respawns are active for both teams throughout the match.</li><li>Defense is all about running down the clock. Defuse planted bombs right away, as the match timer pauses whenever a bomb site is in active countdown. If one of the sites is destroyed, regroup and throw everything you have into defending the last one.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Weapons (Multiplayer &amp; Zombies)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Kilo 141 - Assault Rifle (Call of Duty: Warzone Login Reward)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fully automatic assault rifle with an ergonomic design that improves handling, and a steady fire rate helps stay on target.</li><li>The Kilo 141 is back and ready to tear it up across Multiplayer and Call of Duty: Warzone. The weapon’s smooth handling, manageable recoil, and steady fire rate give it room to shine in a variety of combat situations, leaving no doubt as to why the Kilo 141 was a favorite in Verdansk. Now that the location is back, it’s time to relive the glory days with this hard-hitting Primary Weapon.</li><li>Players will automatically unlock the Kilo 141 for use in Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone after logging in to Call of Duty: Warzone at the launch of Season 03.</li></ul></li><li><strong>CR-56 - Assault Rifle (Battle Pass)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>This lightweight 7.62 x 39mm full-auto assault rifle is compact and powerful. Built exclusively for military use, the standard issue rifle is deadly at mid-range combat and easily configured for a variety of assault tactics.</li><li>Combining high-damage hits with a fast fire rate and good handling, the CR-56 AMAX is the perfect mid-range weapon for downing targets fast. Eliminate enemies in three to four shots up to 25 meters out, leaving plenty left over to chew through equipped armor. Quick reloads get you back into the action fast, a helpful trait no matter how you choose to customize the weapon via Gunsmith.</li></ul></li><li><strong>HDR - Sniper Rifle (Battle Pass)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Anti-material bolt action sniper rifle chambered in 12.7 x 108mm ammunition. Bullets have a lower muzzle velocity but remain devastating even at very long ranges.</li><li>Veterans of Verdansk know the power of the HDR and the havoc a sniper can inflict with it when stationed in high vantage points like the infamous Airport Control Tower. The weapon’s long reach and heavy damage make it a favorite of sharpshooters, its distinctive firing sound sending squads running. Add the Reinforced Barrel attachment to further extend your damage range and bullet velocity, and don’t forget to hold your breath for difficult shots.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Kali Sticks - Melee (Event Reward)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Two-hit kill. Extremely fast attack speed. Short range.</li><li>The infamous Kali Sticks return, dealing out damage with rapid swings that’ll take down your target in a flash. Smack them with fast follow-up hits using the weapon’s light attack or take them out in a more dramatic fashion by unleashing the heavy attack. Use Kali Sticks in Multiplayer with the new Close Shave Perk to deploy a quick whack against enemies without having to manually swap to your Dedicated Melee slot first.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Nail Gun - Special (In-Season)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Full-auto Nail Gun. High damage at close range with fast handling speeds and very low muzzle velocity.</li><li>Stick it to them with this handy tool configured with a magazine of 15 nails that fires at full auto. The damage drops off quickly after 25 meters and performs best up close. The Nail Gun’s low muzzle velocity can make it difficult to land shots against fast moving targets, so get them in your sights and unload before they know what hit them. This armament is a reward earned during the Black Ops Tribute Event.</li></ul></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Attachments</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Monolithic Suppressor (Battle Pass)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Monolithic Core provides superior sound suppression and increased range. Moderate weight increase affects agility.</li><li>Available for Assault Rifles (except AS VAL), SMGs, Shotguns, LMGs, Marksman Rifles, Sniper Rifles, and Pistols.</li></ul></li><li><strong>SWAT 5.56 Grau Conversion (Battle Pass)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Convert the SWAT 5.56 into a fully automatic weapon with lower damage and range but improved accuracy, mobility, and handling. Equips a new default Barrel and Magazine and unlocks an exclusive 50-round extended Magazine. Blocks Barrel attachments.</li></ul></li><li><strong>C9 10mm Auto 30-Round Mags (In-Season)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Conversion kit to use higher caliber 10mm Auto ammunition for increased stopping power. Though the conversion results in some increased recoil and a slightly lower fire rate, the extra damage, range, and velocity make this attachment a worthy consideration when approaching enemies on bigger maps.</li></ul></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Multiplayer Perks</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Close Shave - Enforcer (Event Reward)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Automatically use your Dedicated Melee attack when you perform a weapon butt attack. Simply tap the Melee button to attack. Like the old days!</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Scorestreak (Multiplayer &amp; Zombies)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Death Machine (In-Season)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Heavy minigun with a fast fire rate, high penetration, and a large ammunition capacity.</li><li>Wield the infamous Death Machine, a powerful weapon with a single large magazine that fires high impact rounds at a blistering rate of fire. Score earned while using the Death Machine contributes to your current Scorestreak progress, making this a great tool for bumping up to the next streak.</li></ul></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Zombies Map: Shattered Veil</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Sentinel Artifact in hand, the crew heads to the remote wooded hills above Liberty Falls to meet with S.A.M. at an old mansion in the forest which has been retrofitted to [[REDACTED]]. Only with the aid of S.A.M.’s synthetic mind can the team hope to unlock the ancient artifact’s mysteries and bring back Agent Maxis. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Zombies Perk-A-Cola</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Double Tap</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>The classic rapid-fire Perk returns for the first time in nearly a decade, dramatically increasing your weapon’s fire rate to chew through enemy hordes in record time. Research the iconic Perk for powerful enhancements like an even faster fire rate and the chance to inflict double damage.</li><li>Double Tap is available in Shattered Veil along with the other previously accessible Zombies Perks. Note that some of these Perk-a-Colas are only available via the Der Wunderfizz machine.</li><li>Double Tap is available on The Tomb, Citadelle des Morts, Liberty Falls and Terminus maps via the Der Wunderfizz machine.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Double Tap Augments</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Major<ul data-cy="list"><li>Double Jeopardy<ul data-cy="list"><li>Normal zombies at low health have a chance to die immediately when shot.</li></ul></li><li>Double Impact<ul data-cy="list"><li>Double hits on the same target in quick succession deal more damage.</li></ul></li><li>Double Standard<ul data-cy="list"><li>All non-critical shots do double damage. Only applies to normal bullet weapons.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Minor<ul data-cy="list"><li>Double Time<ul data-cy="list"><li>Increases fire rate bonus.</li></ul></li><li>Double or Nothing<ul data-cy="list"><li>Weapons have a chance to do double damage but also have a chance to do zero damage.</li></ul></li><li>Double Play<ul data-cy="list"><li>Killing two enemies in quick succession has a chance to return two rounds to your magazine. Only applies to normal bullet weapons.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Zombies Wonder Weapons</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Ray Gun  Mark II (+ 3 Variants)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Drop multiple zombies at once with the upgraded and modestly unstable Ray Gun Mark II. Recovered from the Dark Aether by Project Janus, this powerful laser armament delivers three-round bursts of energy, can be Pack-a-Punched, and doubles as a bludgeoning instrument if you’re running low on ammunition. </li><li>Then there’s the three new variants.<ul data-cy="list"><li>Provided you’ve [[REDACTED]], you can experiment with an additional three variants of the Ray Gun Mark II:<ul data-cy="list"><li>Ray Gun Mark II-W: Offering similar bullet patterns to a submachine gun, this also has a random chance to ignite enemies.</li><li>Ray Gun Mark II-P: Shooting ammunition like a shotgun, with a chance to spawn a sigil with the ability to grant invulnerability to the player standing on it for a limited time.</li><li>Ray Gun Mark II-R: Dropping zombies with a Marksman Rifle-like discharge, expect a chance to spread a plague infection that can inflict area-of-effect damage. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Wunderwaffe DG-2</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Capable of striking down hordes with chain-lightning blasts, this has the bonus effect of stunning crowds of zombies, usually resulting in additional, and eventually terminal damage. </li></ul></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Zombies Enemies</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Elder Disciple</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Strange, floating apparitions have been seen flitting about the sprawling gardens and rambling mansion estate. Known to some as Elder Disciples, these powerful enemies likely spell trouble for the crew. </li><li>Elder Disciples gain strength as they empower the zombies around them while summoning more undead to join the battle. Using their dark magic, these fetid, floating carcasses can force their allies to evolve more quickly, allowing a lowly zombie to more rapidly transform into a Doppelghast or some other sinister form.</li><li>Eliminate the Elder Disciple before their forces grow too powerful, keeping it at a distance to avoid the scream it lets loose against players who draw too close. The deadly enemy grows more agitated as it takes damage, so try to get the job done fast.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Toxic Zombies</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>As a sickly yellow fog descends across the mansion, expect the inhabitants to take on an even-more revolting pallor. Easily identifiable due to their greenish hue and more skeletal exterior, Toxic Zombies seem to have lost all but their base perambulatory functions and seem intent on sprinting toward their prey before exploding, leaving a damaging pool of acid in their wake. Listen for their telltale shriek and get the jump on them before they can close the distance.</li></ul></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New GobbleGums</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Tactical Diffusion (Rare)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Disables the next Nuke Power-Up explosion you activate and gives everyone 2,000 Essence instead.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Support Group (Legendary)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Gobble up this tasty GobbleGum to acquire the ARC-XD, Mangler Cannon, Sentry Gun and Mutant Injection Support items.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Die Pitched (Whimsical)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Zombies have high-pitched voices.

Almost every attachment that modifies the core behavior of a weapon is receiving an improvement to help with its viability in the meta. It is our goal to ensure that all existing and future weapon mods feel fun and powerful to use.</em></p><p><em> Semi-auto weapons are another broad target for buffs this patch. The changes aim to make these weapons more accessible and competitive, as well as create more distinct gameplay feel between the faster semi-auto primaries.</em></p><p><em> As a last top-level note, the Season 3 patch includes adjustments to the Jackal PDW. More details on the thinking behind the change can be found below. Our weapon balance philosophy is to be conservative with nerfs, and to always consider whether there is an opportunity to elevate other weapons instead. In this case, we feel strongly that tuning down the Jackal PDW will be good for the health of the weapon meta going forward.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shotguns</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>All three shotguns have improvements to their alternate ammo types: Dragon’s Breath and Slug Rounds. Dragon’s Breath now has a slightly higher damage over time, as well as longer range. Pellet damage is also being improved at various ranges. The goal is to make Dragon’s Breath a longer range alternative that still retains a classic shotgun feel.</em></p><p><em> Slug Rounds are getting significant buffs, with the goal of giving each shotgun a unique alternate playstyle. The Marine SP Slugs have a massive range improvement, which paired with better headshot damage turn it into a high risk, high reward precision weapon.

Initially, these enhancements will focus on the Black Ops 6 catalogue, subsequently extending to legacy weapons.</strong></p><p><strong> Our goal with these changes is to increase the lethality of every encounter, reinvigorate overlooked weapon classes, and encourage players to adopt a more thoughtful and deliberate strategy in preparation for engagements.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><u><strong>Classic Weapons</strong></u></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Kilo 141 </strong><em><strong>Assault Rifle</strong></em><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Fully automatic assault rifle with an ergonomic design that improves handling, and a steady fire rate helps stay on target.</strong></li><li><strong>Available via Call of Duty: Warzone Login Reward</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>CR-56 AMAX</strong><em><strong> Assault Rifle</strong></em><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>This lightweight 7.62 x 39mm full-auto assault rifle is compact and powerful.
