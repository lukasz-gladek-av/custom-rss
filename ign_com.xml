Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>In this new frozen world, players follow in the footsteps of legendary Ark survivor Mei Yin, on a soul-searching quest deep into the chilling heart of darkness to find answers to long-buried secrets of Ark’s past.</blockquote><blockquote>Ark: Lost Colony will present survivors with thrilling new challenges as they become the hunted in a vast occupied city, and gain access to powerful new kinds of character abilities, unique gear, building systems, and phenomenally exotic tames.</blockquote><blockquote>Will Survivors be able to face down the demons lurking in Arat Prime, and connect Ark's past and future?</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In its note to press, Studio Wildcard said Ark: Lost Colony “directly connects” the storylines of Ark’s Extinction and Genesis expansions and leads into the events of Ark 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ark 2 is the Unreal Engine 5-powered sequel to the hugely successful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ark-survival-evolved"><u>Ark Survival Evolved</u></a>. It was first announced with a surprise Vin Diesel cameo at The Game Awards 2020, at the time with a 2022 release date, but it was later delayed into 2023. Then, earlier in 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ark-2-delayed-again-to-2024-but-a-next-gen-version-of-the-first-game-is-out-in-august"><u>Ark 2 was delayed again</u></a>, this time to late 2024 as an Xbox Series X and S console exclusive, day-one on Game Pass, and on PC via Steam and Windows.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As recently as December 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ark-2-still-on-track-for-late-2024-ceo-says">Studio Wildcard was still insisting Ark 2 was on track for a late 2024 release window</a>. Obviously that didn’t happen, sparking concern from fans. So this announcement, coming three months into 2025, will help reassure fans that Ark 2 is still in the works, although Studio Wildcard failed to provide an updated release window.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We do have firmer details for Ark: Lost Colony, however. Pre-orders kick off in June 2025, and all purchases immediately unlock exclusive Ark: Lost Colony preview gameplay content. A full release is set for November 2025, with Ark: Lost Colony priced at $29.99 for Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
