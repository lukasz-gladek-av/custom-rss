As you’d expect, the internet captured the trailer, which we expect will be released officially soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Complete Edition includes the base game and all the DLC released so far for both PS5 and PC. The news comes over a year after Stellar Blade’s successful April 2024 launch on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stellar Blade has all the features you’d expect on PC, including AI upscaling via Nvidia DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 3, an unlocked framerate, Japanese and Chinese voiceover, ultrawide display support, higher resolution environment textures, and DualSense support for haptic feedback and trigger effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, the trailer reveals a new boss battle vs Mann, Leader of the Sentinels, and 25 new costumes, which we presume will also be made available on PS5. Players have also noticed that, at the end of the trailer, Eve lets go of a memory stick — a sequence that isn't in the base game. Some are now speculating Stellar Blade is set for a new ending or maybe even DLC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/qua2wq8-1747125726116.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The trailer reveals the Stellar Blade Complete Edition, coming to PC and PS5.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Stellar Blade was a big hit for Korean developer Shift Up, bringing in $43 million in royalties in its last financial year. It expects the PC version to outsell the PS5 version, which sold more than 1 million copies in two months. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-shift-up-considering-a-sequel"><u>Shift Up has said it's considering making another game in the franchise</u></a>, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stellar Blade sees players take on the role of Eve as she battles against unknown invaders to reclaim Earth in fast paced action role-playing game combat. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-review"><u>It earned a 7/10 in IGN's review</u></a> and proved popular otherwise, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-exclusive-stellar-blade-sells-1-million-copies"><u>quickly selling a million copies</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Stellar Blade is great in all of the most important ways for an action game, but dull characters, a lackluster story, and several frustrating elements of its RPG mechanics prevent it from soaring along with the best of the genre," we said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
