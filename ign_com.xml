Well, you're in luck! We've searched for all active working codes for the Roblox experience, so you don't have to. Redeem these for a range of bonuses that include Lucky Spins and cash, helping you swish your way to victory. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/basketball-zero-page-1742917861952.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Working Basketball: Zero Codes (March 2025)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Below, you'll find a list of all the currently active Basketball: Zero codes we've found as of this month:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>1MLIKES</strong> - 3x Lucky Style spins, 3x Lucky Zone Spins</li><li><strong>400KWOW </strong>- 1x Lucky Style Spin, 15,000 Money</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">All Expired Basketball: Zero Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Time's up on these codes, unfortunately. As of this month, the following codes no longer work:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>100KW</li><li>WCHROLLO</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Redeem Basketball: Zero Codes</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/26/basketball-zero-code-entry-1742999758038.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><ol data-cy="list"><li>First, you'll need to <strong>like and join the Basketball: Zero group</strong> on Roblox to be able to use codes</li><li>Then, load up the Basketball: Zero Roblox experience</li><li>In the <strong>bottom right corner</strong> of the screen, you'll find the codes button.

However, plenty of codes for Roblox experiences are also case-sensitive. So, it might be that you've typed it incorrectly. Whether a code has been entered incorrectly in Basketball: Zero, or it's expired, you'll see a pop-up saying "code doesn't exist." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To avoid using an incorrect code, we'd recommend copying them directly from this article and pasting them into the code box. We test them all before we add them to the article, so you can be certain that if it's on here, it's a valid code. Just be sure to check you haven't added a sneaky extra space in there when copying it over.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Get More Basketball: Zero Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We check for codes on a daily basis, so if there's a new code, you'll be able to find it in this article. If you want to search for them yourself, however, you can head over to the <a href="https://discord.gg/TNUfusBD" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basketball: Zero Discord server</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Basketball: Zero in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no surprise that in Basketball Zero, you'll be playing... basketball. The fast-paced 5v5 game will see you dribbling the ball across the court to face opponents and try to score as many points as possible. By unlocking new styles and zones, you'll earn a range of atheles and bonuses that will give you special advantages. The Flash, for example, has excellent speed and agility, while the Star athelete can leap like no other. Redeeming the codes above will give you chances at Lucky Spins, which unlock the Styles and Zones, while the cash will enable you to unlock emotes and goal effects, to really celebrate the wins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lauren Harper is an Associate Guides Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/honor-of-kings-world-the-first-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you didn’t already know it, Honor of Kings is one of the most played games in the world. Taking the number one spot in the Chinese MOBA charts, the TiMi Group is taking its free-to-play characters – and world – in a new direction with Honor of Kings: World. While its scale and monetization screech in dissonance, its flashy combat, diverse roster of playable classes, and multiplayer-flexible modes do carry some promise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During my half-hour-long hands-on with Honor of Kings: World at Tencent’s GDC booth, I took some time to toy around with a couple of World’s different classes, take on a boss inspired by Chinese folklore, and see a brief glimpse of the story.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Honor of Kings: World - First Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it boasts many of the same characters as its mobile MOBA predecessor, Honor of Kings: World is no MOBA. Instead, it’s a class-driven action game – for PC as well as mobile, by the way – with the kind of over-the-shoulder, action-driven combat you might expect from something like Genshin Impact. But rather than locking mechanics or gameplay behind randomized drops like in MiHoYo’s game, Honor of Kings offers players different classes to choose from. And while the same overall control scheme unifies each class – a dodge, three standard abilities, and an ultimate of sorts – the roster of different classes struck me as fairly diverse, each with its own abilities and special perks.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Honor of Kings: World is no MOBA. Instead, it’s a class-driven action game – for PC as well, by the way.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Usually, you’ll be able to play with two separate classes, though sometimes you might need to stick with just one for story purposes. It seems like TiMi’s put a lot of effort into the dual-class system, allowing you to switch between the two during combat. The most interesting example they showed during my demo was starting a long, multiple-attack combo and switching characters once the target was launched into the air to extend a combo. It kind of reminded me of a tag system in a fighting game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With 11 different classes in the demo I played, I’m certain there are tons of different combinations and ways to style on your opponent. But since this was my first time playing, I looked for balance above all else: I stuck with an even-keeled loadout, using a sword-wielding class for my primary role and a ranged gunner for the second. The two nicely filled in gaps left by the other during my attempt at a boss fight: I’d lay down fire using the gunner’s active reload mechanic to improve my damage and rate of fire when the boss was spitting out attacks in a frenzy, making sure to dodge the occasional flaming projectile and then rush him down with my sword, laying on the damage with a vengeance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This swapping was easily my favorite part of the demo. I enjoyed hammering away at the boss’s stance meter, breaking his stance, and shooting the gunner’s R ability as I closed the distance, swapping to my sword class, and unleashing a devastating ultimate attack of sorts to juice every second from the boss’ temporarily weakened state.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking the boss down to a certain point also revealed an interesting story beat that eventually led to me playing as a completely separate character from the pre-built avatar provided for the demo. TiMi didn’t offer much information on how frequently to expect this kind of change, only that it would happen from time to time. The demo took place somewhere closer to halfway through Honor of Kings: World’s runtime, opening up my two classes’ skill trees just enough for me to have some fun with them without overcomplicating its combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The boss itself was a giant monkey character with various different masks, with a personality and attacking style for each. According to the developer leading my demo, this mechanic has its roots in a traditional style of Chinese theater called <em>Bian lian</em>. One mask might see him spitting fire in a massive area of effect on the map, while another might see him throw around a few melee attacks. I loved this melding of culture, history, and story with a gameplay mechanic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from briefly seeing another journalist in my demo in a hub area before the tutorial, I didn’t have a chance to check out any of World’s multiplayer offerings. TiMi showed a few clips of four-person squads crawling dungeons and taking on bosses before our demo, but teased something that sounded more like an MMO. That part is still a work in progress, so they didn’t share much beyond acknowledging that there would be a bigger scale multiplayer mode in the full game, so I’m curious to see what that looks like given my demo’s single-player scope.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I left the demo concerned about monetization.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Before the demo, one of TiMi’s developers walked me through some of World’s premise and setup, saying that Honor of Kings: World was a gift of sorts to the MOBA’s loyal fanbase that’s propelled it to massive success in the ten years since its launch. True as that may be, I left the demo concerned about monetization.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When another journalist asked about how TiMi plans to make money with Honor of Kings: World, the developer leading our session gave a concerning answer. “The game’s gonna be based around social, so outfits and stuff,” they said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On its own, funding a free-to-play game with cosmetics isn’t necessarily a problem – especially since the developers made it clear that there wouldn’t be any pay-to-win – but given Honor of Kings: World’s scale, with flashy cutscenes, tons of playable characters, and epic boss fights, I can’t help but feel concerned about whether or not World’s model is financially sustainable, regardless of whether or not it’s based on one of the most successful games of the century.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Honor of Kings: World undoubtedly has a bright future ahead of it, provided TiMi can stick to its promise of giving fans of its MOBA hit a celebration worthy of its success. Even though I’m still a little worried about the amount of microtransactions that Honor of Kings: World could potentially need to fund its high production value, I still had a ton of fun dodging the big primate’s swings.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-sky-relics-update-lets-players-become-space-palaeontologists<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man’s Sky</a> developer Hello Games has detailed its latest update, Relics, which lets players become palaeontologists by digging up the skeletal remains of alien creatures. It’s out now across PC, console, and VR for free.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When new bones are discovered, players can piece them together to their own design, Hello Games explained. They can even create their own museums, or share their collections with other players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There is a truly huge variety of procedural prehistoric bones, in all shapes and sizes, to excavate and collect,” Hello Games added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s up to you how you reassemble them and there’s a lot of fun to be had building ever-more outrageous skeletons to put on display in your bases-turned-museums or share with your fellow Travellers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fossils out there to be discovered vary hugely in rarity, so you never quite know what you’re going to unearth. There’s a real buzz when you find something truly rare. The most uncommon finds hold huge value. For those trying desperately to finish their collection, we introduced a specialist who can be bartered with at the Space Station.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the launch of Relics is a community expedition focusing on palaeontology, which challenges players to compete for the rarest finds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Players should be wary where they choose to excavate though,” Hello Games warned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Some things have been buried for a reason. Dangerous creatures guard the greatest treasure and may be awoken from their slumber, including Stone Ghosts, and the colossal Stone Golem. New creatures have been introduced too, along with their skeletons. Including the awesome skeletal Titan Worm!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Man’s Sky continues to receive free updates even now, years after launch. And it’s clearly keeping players interested. Hello Games said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-skys-massive-worlds-part-2-update-adds-billions-of-new-solar-systems-and-trillions-of-new-planets">the recently released Worlds Part II update</a> fueled some of No Man’s Sky’s highest player numbers early in the year.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">No Man's Sky Relics Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In November, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-sky-dev-hello-games-hails-very-positive-steam-rating-8-years-after-overwhelmingly-negative-launch"><u>Hello Games hailed No Man’s Sky hitting a ‘very positive’ Steam user review user rating</u></a> for the first time, eight years after the game’s controversial launch was slammed by players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Man’s Sky launched in August 2016 on PS4 and PC to tens of thousands of negative reviews on Steam, with players complaining about broken promises and a lack of meaningful content, particularly on the multiplayer side. The game quickly settled on the dreaded ‘overwhelmingly negative’ Steam user review rating, a clear sign to anyone who visited its Steam page that something was very wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Guildford, England-based developer Hello Games has continued to update No Man’s Sky over the years, improving player sentiment to the point where it is now considered superb. It took two years to hit ‘mixed,’ then another three to hit ‘mostly positive.’ At the time, five years after launch, Tim Woodley, Head of Publishing at Hello Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-sky-gets-mostly-positive-steam-review-5-years"><u>explained how hard it was to claw back Steam user reviews from such a low base</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Hello Games continues to work on No Man’s Sky, it’s developing its next game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/light-no-fire"><u>Light No Fire</u></a>. It's about adventure, building, survival and exploration together, set on a fantasy planet the size of Earth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
