            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-prince-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not entirely convinced Dogubomb didn’t develop Blue Prince as a personal gift to me, specifically. This exceedingly clever puzzler mixes together a shortlist of my top game genres and concepts: First-person puzzling with a straightforward facade that hides a seemingly bottomless pit of secrets, roguelite runs that perfectly balance permanent improvements with the growth of your own skills, drafting mechanics that capitalize on the best parts of deckbuilders without the baggage that comes with actually being one, and even tile-based map building reminiscent of my favorite board game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/carcassonne-board-game-buying-guide"><u>Carcassone</u></a>. Even if there are things in that pile of Tom Stuff that don’t excite you as much as they do me, the combination comes together <em>beautifully</em>. I’m still rabidly peeling back the layers of this onion after dozens of hours, but I’m already certain Blue Prince has secured its place as an all-time puzzle great. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as Simon, a teenage boy who has inherited the stately mansion of his well-respected and somewhat eccentric great uncle, but may only claim that inheritance if he can figure out how to navigate the ever-shifting halls of the estate in order to find a hidden 46th room. It’s a fairly simple setup at the start (apart from the whole M.C. Escher shifting house thing), and while there are plenty of helpful tips scattered around for you to find, you are largely just set loose to see what you can piece together for yourself. It’s a great foundation, because while you don’t always know what the next step may be, your goals <em>are </em>always clear enough that I never felt like I was just wandering around in the dark.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tom's Top 10 First-Person Puzzle Games</h3><p>My favorite first-person puzzle games!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You probably <em>will </em>feel like you are wandering around in circles from time to time, though. The meat of Blue Prince is the drafting mechanic you use to explore the house: You start each day with a limited number of “steps” that are spent whenever you go through a door, and each time you open a new one you are given three options for which of the mansion’s many unique rooms will be on the other side. That means you are filling out the nine-by-five room floorplan differently every single time, connecting doorways and trying not to hit dead ends as you find helpful items and invaluable clues along the way. It may sound like nothing too outside the box, but it’s a real delight to slowly gain mastery over this system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some rooms are just simple hallways, while others play more varied roles that are split into colored categories based on type. For example, purple bedrooms often give you additional steps when entered, yellow shops can sell helpful items if you’ve picked up enough coins to buy them, and red rooms have negative effects (like obscuring your draft options) that could throw a wrench in your plans. Certain rooms may only appear when specific conditions are met, too, such as when you are drafting on the edges of the house or once you get deep enough in. It was fun to figure out which should be my go-to rooms early on in order to set myself up for success later, gathering items like keys to unlock doors or gems that can be spent to draft special rooms, and then using that prep work to make targeted dives toward a room or lead I was eager to hunt down. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s a real delight to slowly gain mastery over the drafting system.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual “puzzles” take on a variety of different forms within those rooms, but all of them are as entertaining as they are devilish to solve. Some have very straightforward math or logic problems, there are a few literal puzzle boxes to find, and others require a slightly more complicated combination of button pushes or lever pulls to solve whatever that room is doing. But fully self-contained challenges like that are side dishes to what Blue Prince truly has to offer, and the most interesting stuff feels closer to incredible first-person puzzle games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/22/return-of-the-obra-dinn-review"><u>Return of the Obra Dinn</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/30/outer-wilds-review"><u>Outer Wilds</u></a>. It asks you to really look at the world around you, take notes on what you find, and then use that knowledge to make connections where you can – and it does so in that expert way where something can feel completely cryptic at the outset and then brilliantly achievable when you finally crack it. That might mean looking through documents to find the combination to a safe, decoding why certain objects are where they are, or using the function of a specific room to get past an obstacle somewhere else.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That last part can lead to the only real point of frustration I found with Blue Prince, however, which is that the best-laid floorplans of house mice and men can come crashing down with a few bad draws. Don’t get me wrong, there are very real and effective ways to help mitigate the randomness of which rooms are offered to you – both in terms of learning what to prioritize and when you should or shouldn’t take risks, as well as in permanent upgrades I won’t spoil that can make future runs more consistent. But, plain and simple, sometimes you will need a room that lets you turn left, do everything in your power to set yourself up to get it (including collecting dice that let you reroll the rooms you draw), and still be as stuck as Zoolander when you’re ultimately given your options. Those bad breaks are infrequent, but it still stings when an otherwise-good run ends because you just never saw the room you were looking for. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">(Tangentially, I also <em>really</em> wish you could save and quit mid-run without having to cut your progress short by ending your current day entirely, or at the very least that opening the menu stopped the in-game clock from ticking. Runs can often stretch over an hour, which makes dipping in and out of Blue Prince a hard proposition – though this is only really a problem since I was playing on a desktop PC, as consoles and even the Steam Deck would let you suspend it if you need to go do something else.)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There is <em>so much</em> to discover that any given run is rarely a waste of time.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, any pain from that randomness is mitigated by the fact that there is just <em>so much</em> to discover here that a given run is rarely a waste of time. You may not have been able to draft that specific combination of rooms you were after or reach that certain square you wanted to, but odds are you still entered some new rooms along the way, and doing so almost always added to the growing list of mysteries I have jotted down across a pile of handwritten notes. “Beating” Blue Prince took me about 15 hours, and getting to that 46th room is absolutely a satisfying puzzle to solve on its own, but I also have far more goals now than I did when I first set out. There are safes to open, doors to unlock, books and letters to read, clues to decipher, and <em>loads</em> of lore to uncover. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s impressive how all of these optional puzzles are woven into and around the path of the “main” one – some are hiding in plain sight from the first minute, just waiting for you to realize they are important, while others drop an unassuming string of crumbs in your way that lead down a deep and unexpected rabbit hole when followed. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Blue Prince Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Blue Prince was an incredibly difficult game to talk about with friends who were also playing because the randomness of the drafting mechanic, combined with your own personal sense of curiosity, can send two players down very different paths. One time when I was around five hours in, I excitedly mentioned I’d unlocked something to a friend who had already played 40, only to learn they hadn’t even found that thing yet. And yet, this fractal abode doesn’t frustrate by randomly withholding things either, because clues can often be found in multiple forms or places; Once again, you’re always making progress toward <em>something</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you do get deeper, Blue Prince’s initially light-touch story also begins to shift more directly into the spotlight. Discovering more about both your character’s great uncle and the larger history of their family starts off as a little fun set dressing, but it eventually becomes as rich and compelling a reason to keep playing as any puzzle. The worldbuilding here is doled out with a patience I’m not used to seeing, with tons to learn about your relatives, the manor, and the nation it’s located in, but none of that is ever forced down your throat. That made anything I could glean about important historical events or complex geopolitics feel like a win that would almost always help me solve future mysteries, not just some “lore” to read about in books or letters and then move on from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still avoiding spoilers like laser tripwires in a Mission Impossible trap, that story and its themes smartly tie into your actions in a way few games are able to pull off so successfully. Piecing together the messy history of an extended and sometimes estranged family is rarely a linear process - Simon wanders through the house he has suddenly inherited finding bits of information told from conflicting points of view, and often in the entirely wrong order. Trying to make all of the right connections as he goes from a boy simply solving a fun puzzle so he can win a prize to one who understands the real reward this mansion holds reflected my own journey with Blue Prince, which is the sort of subtle brilliance you don’t see in many games.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Blue Prince is the kind of puzzle game that dug deep into my brain and didn’t let go. Its complex mysteries weave brilliantly into the careful decision making of how to lay out the mansion’s rooms on each randomized run, leaving me building floorplans in my sleep almost every night after I played it. The story that slowly emerges within this fascinating place is also a compelling one, and it had me hungrily hunting for clues and combinations for many hours after I reached the credits while also poetically tying into the mechanics that lead you to them. Hitting a dead end you did everything in your power to avoid can frustrate from time to time, but this sprawling estate has so much to uncover that the randomness never stalled my progress for too long. If The Witness, Portal, and Myst are already emblazoned on the Mount Rushmore of first-person puzzle games, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Blue Prince carved alongside them soon enough.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunt-update-list-of-everything-new-plus-helpful-guides-and-tools<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Path of Exile 2’s largest update yet, Dawn of the Hunt, adds a ton of new content and changes the game in many ways. IGN and Maxroll have teamed up to bring you lots of new, helpful guides and builds to take on the daunting swatch of new stuff that we will do our best to summarize here: Patch 0.2.0 brings more ways to play with the all-new Huntress Class along with 5 Ascendancies, Azmeri Wisps to chase, shiny new Uniques to hunt for, and a revamped endgame experience.</p><h2 data-cy="title1">The Huntress</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/huntress-1744061318230.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A new class joins Path of Exile 2’s roster of characters, the Huntress. This Azmeri lost everything when she used a Virtue Gem to defend her home. So now she wields new skills in addition to her trusty Spear. The Huntress is a Dexterity class that shares a starting area with the Ranger in the lower-right portion of the Passive Skill Tree. Spears have a mix of close-range melee strikes and long range projectiles with bonuses that incentivize the use of both. Create an elemental surface with Frostbolt, drop a Whirling Slash, and unleash a flurry of Twisters, before leaping back in to do it all again. Another new item class is Bucklers, a special shield with the ability to Parry regular attacks. When you Parry an enemy you put them off balance increasing the attack damage they take. Unlike Souls games, there is no Parry window and you can use the Parry to animation cancel other skills making it quite agile. However, each time you Parry your stun meter increases and when the bar is full you are heavy stunned for 2.5 seconds, which is likely to result in your untimely demise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dive deeper with <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/news/patch-0-2-0-dawn-of-the-hunt-reveal-megapost" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maxroll’s Dawn of the Hunt Megapost</a>, or read on for more information.</p><h2 data-cy="title1">New Ascendancies</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the new Huntress class, Dawn of the Hunt adds 5 new Ascendancies to Path of Exile 2. After <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/getting-started/trials-of-ascendancy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">completing a Trial of Ascension</a>, your Ascendancy further specializes your class by unlocking new synergies and catering to unique playstyles. The Huntress has 2 Ascendancies to choose from, Ritualist and Amazon, and the Warrior, Witch, and Mercenary each get one new option.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ritualist</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/ritualistascendancynodes-1744061367270.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Ritualist learned in the depths of the Wildwoods, that power is achieved through sacrifice. You can steal bonuses from Rare monsters, or sacrifice a portion of your own health for a random bonus. With <strong>Corrupted Life Force,</strong> you gain a skill causing nearby enemies to grow <strong>Volatile Blood Boils</strong>, slay them to infect surrounding foes with <strong>Corrupted Blood</strong> a powerful degenerative effect that deals <em>Physical Damage</em>. The <strong>Unfurled Finger </strong>Notable grants a third ring slot, this is especially potent when paired with <strong>Mystic Attunement </strong>and a high-end ring. Lastly, the Ritualist has a variety of charming bonuses making it easier to combat dangerous elemental effects.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/amazonascendancynodes-1744061458869.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">An Amazon strikes swiftly. <strong>Elemental Infusion</strong> consumes charges to add elemental damage to your Attacks, and <strong>Infused Avata</strong>r gives a chance for your projectiles to benefit from the infusion without consuming it. <strong>Critical Strike</strong> and <strong>Penetrate </strong>further scale damage, based on accuracy rating, which is particularly notable because Dexterity classes have easy access to accuracy. Defensively, <strong>Mystic Harvest </strong>opens up access to leech, a recovery layer usually limited to Physical damage, and <strong>Azmeri Brew</strong> makes Flasks far more versatile. Lastly, her <strong>Predatory Instinct </strong>and <strong>In for the Kill </strong>Notables grant massive bonuses against Wraeclast’s most dangerous foes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Smith of Kitava</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/smithofkitavaascendancynodes-1744061520857.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Smith of Kitava wields the Devourer’s power to his own ends. This ascendancy is harder to nail down, as many of the bonuses like <strong>Temper Weapon</strong>, <strong>Maifest Weapon</strong>, and <strong>Fire Spell on Hit</strong> are the sort of thing you need to play with to truly understand. However, <strong>Coal Stoker</strong> and <strong>Forged in Flame</strong> provide some of the most powerful defenses in the game. With <strong>Coal Stoaker</strong>, you need to dedicate less of your suffixes to resistances, meaning there’s more of them to use for damage. Maximum resistance is incredibly potent, with even as little as +5% Maximum Resistance mitigating around 20% of the elemental damage you take. Lastly, there’s <strong>Smith’s Masterwork</strong>, the ability to forge yourself a custom chest piece at the cost of some Ascendancy points. How useful this is depends on where <strong>Living Weapon</strong>, <strong>Against the Anvil</strong>, and <strong>Heat of the Forge</strong> fall as you only get 8 Ascendancy points to distribute amongst all the passives. With that said many of the passives including, <strong>Dedication to Kitava</strong>, <strong>Support Straps</strong>, <strong>Flowing Metal</strong>, <strong>Molten Symbol</strong>, and <strong>Kitavan Engraving</strong> all have potential.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lich</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/tacticianascendancynodes-1744061506306.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A Lich wields forbidden power, even at the cost of her soul. First, there are some fan-favorite nodes from the original Path of Exile in <strong>Rupture the Soul </strong>and <strong>Dominion Over Flesh</strong>. Being able to curse enemies to make them explode into piles of loot is always a good time. <strong>Soulless Form</strong> provides a unique way to solve mana by increasing your maximum life. It also splits damage between your life and energy shield which is useful when you have easy ways to recover both. <strong>Eternal Life</strong> further enhances this effect, because your life cannot change while you have energy shield any damage split to your life is ignored so long as you have energy shield active. <strong>Atziri’s Distain</strong> splits damage to your life allowing you to ignore even more damage. Then there’s <strong>Necromantic Conduit</strong> and <strong>Blackened Heart</strong>, a way to provide a significant damage buff to yourself or allies, and what better allies exist than the mindless dead bound to your command? Lastly, Crystalline Phylactery, Price of Power, and Eldrich Empowerment offer solid bonuses to a variety of builds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Note:</strong> there is a slight error in the graphic, <strong>Blackened Heart </strong>should be the node after <strong>Necromantic Conduit </strong>and <strong>Dominion Over Flesh</strong> should be the node after <strong>Rupture the Soul</strong>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Tactician</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/lichascendancynodes-1744061514213.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Tactician never works alone. This is a support-focused Ascendancy for the Mercenary class. It provides a variety of bonuses focused on Auras and buffs.<strong> A Solid Plan</strong> is particularly noteworthy as it’s normally difficult to scale your Spirit without using Sceptres. With <strong>Suppressing Fire</strong> and <strong>Right Where We Want Them</strong>, you can Pin foes to prevent them from acting, adding another crowd control effect to your party’s toolkit. <strong>Unleash Hell! </strong>Is a unique skill that gives you personal artillery, summon them to unleash a barrage of withering fire onto the battlefield.</p><h2 data-cy="title1">Azmeri Wisps</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/spirits-cinematic-1744061829344.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With each new league, comes a new league mechanic, and for Dawn of the Hunt it’s Azmeri Wisps. Follow the lights and slay any monsters they empower. Each Wisp enhances the rewards of any monsters it empowers while giving them a variety of lethal bonuses. For example, a Cat Wisp gives empowered monsters Critical Hit Chance, whereas a Sacred Wisp upgrades the monster’s tier, turning Rares into Unique Bosses! Each time you encounter a Wisp it seeks out a Rare or Unique monster to infuse, greatly increasing the creature’s strength and its rewards.</p><h2 data-cy="title1">Rogue Exiles</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/rogueexilescinematic-1744061738609.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can encounter Rogue Exiles, NPC invaders who fight like players and even wield powerful items. If you’re able to slay them, you get all the items they’re wearing, but be warned, if they slay you they escape and take their riches with them. Rogue Exiles provide a different kind of challenge since their builds work like a player’s, with a wide variety of skill combinations on offer. These foes tend to be more agile than most bosses, but aren’t as tanky. Keep an eye on their Unique items as these can be extremely valuable, and may make the encounter much more difficult!</p><h2 data-cy="title1">Endgame Revamp</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/rougeexilegameplay-1744061926517.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Dawn of the Hunt brings sweeping changes to Path of Exile 2’s endgame experience. The goal is to make mapping more exciting by providing players with more random encounters while reducing tedious busy work. You can now use up to 3 tablets in each Tower, this reduces the amount of busy work needed to enhance the nearby maps and maximize your loot. To balance this, fewer Towers spawn and they have been revamped to be more rewarding. Mechanics can spawn in Towers and they are guarded by a Unique Boss. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Corruption mechanic has also been changed, you now choose between clearing each corrupted map, or rushing to the center to purify the cluster, changing the rewards, and unlocking the new purified map type. You can choose to farm the corrupted zones, slaying additional enemies in hopes of gaining currency and rare items. Alternatively, you could rush to the nexus to purify the zone in hopes of obtaining more Fraturing Orbs. This is a crafting currency that locks an affix on an item with 4 modifiers, making it unmodifiable by any means.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/shatteredlakegameplay-1744061926517.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a wealth of content to explore. In addition, Unique Maps present special challenges, each is difficult but rewarding. The <strong>Fractured Lake</strong> (pictured above) rewards you with exclusive base types that have more Prefixes or Suffixes than are normally possible.<strong> </strong>A<strong> Crystalline Cavern</strong> presents you with a room full of Essences to claim. Each one you defeat further empowers the boss, making the challenge at the end both more lethal and rewarding. Or you could explore the <strong>Feral Megaliths</strong>, a 10-round boss gauntlet that drops tons of loot and exclusive Runes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond just endgame content, crafting also got numerous changes. You can use Corrupted Essences to craft items with special effects. <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/resources/ritual" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">When encountering Rituals</a> to the <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/bosses/king-in-the-mists-boss-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">King in the Mists</a> you’re now guaranteed an Omen, and Omen rewards are more common. If you <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe2/resources/expedition" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explore Expedition</a> you can now use your currencies to Recombinate items, merging 2 bases in hopes of keeping desirable affixes.</p><h2 data-cy="title1">Patch Notes</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/07/uniquescinematic2-1744061998091.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s almost easier to talk about what didn’t change than it is to list everything that got tweaked, adjusted, or reworked for Dawn of the Hunt.

This build captures the feel of a Diablo 2 Javazon by blasting everything on the screen with lightning. As an endgame build you need to be in maps to start playing it, so use one of the earlier planners through the campaign and then respec to this. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lich</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Chaos DoT, or damage over time skills like Essence Drain and Contagion excel at clearing the screen while providing consistent damage.
