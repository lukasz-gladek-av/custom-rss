The news has caused Ready or Not's Steam user review rating to hit "mostly negative" for recent reviews, although overall the review rating remains "very positive." Most of the negative reviews complain about "censorship." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in a new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1144200" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>statement</u></a>, VOID set out "full visibility" into what has, and has not, changed, including before-and-after screenshots. It insisted "the effects of gore and violence have not been toned down."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We recently shared that Ready or Not’s PC version underwent minor content changes to support stability and align with policies enforced by global platforms and age rating bodies," the statement began. "These adjustments were made to ensure a smooth global launch across platforms — while fully preserving the game’s tone, themes, and intensity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Unfortunately, we’ve seen misconceptions and misinformation circulating around the scope of these changes. We want to ensure our entire community has full visibility into what has — and has not — changed. We’re including before-and-after visuals to show that the game’s tone, atmosphere, and graphical impact remain intact. The effects of gore and violence — key to the game’s immersive realism — have not been toned down."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">VOID stressed that missions such as Elephant, Neon Tomb, and the infamous Valley of the Dolls "remain unchanged," adding it has "always believed in creative freedom and the right to build experiences that push boundaries in the service of immersion and realism. That will not change."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At the same time, we operate in a global ecosystem of platform standards, age rating boards, and local legal restrictions," the studio added. "While we may disagree with how some content is treated, we’ve only made changes where absolutely required, and only to the letter of the regulations — no further. As a hyper-realistic tactical FPS, Ready or Not faces different scrutiny than more stylized or fictional games. That’s a reality of the world we publish in — not a change in our creative vision or values."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Potentially distrubing images of Ready or Not follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team then outlined specifically what the "six targeted visual changes" entailed: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Twisted Nerve: The girl is now depicted as sleeping instead of convulsing  </li><li>A Lethal Obsession: Nudity involving the ghillie suit suspect has been adjusted </li><li>Hide and Seek: Female hostages now wear underwear </li><li>Narcos: Police informant hostage now wears underwear </li><li>23 Megabytes a Second: ‘Photo of Minors’ objective model was revised, also to better connect narratively with the later ‘Sinuous Trail’ mission</li><li>Post-mortem dismemberment has been disabled (note: dismemberment for living characters remains unchanged).</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ready or Not Before-and-After Screenshots July 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's not about the specifics, it's a matter of principle," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1144200/eventcomments/596279376609306968?snr=2_9_100000_#c596279376609307117" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a> one respondent in the comments.

Over the last four years, however, Mayles has been overseeing Everwild, Rare's long-gestating fantasy follow-up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox">that will now no longer see the light of day</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Everwild's cancellation, now confirmed by Microsoft, comes six years after the game's initial public announcement, and after around a decade of work by Rare on the project overall. Louise O'Connor, who had been serving as the game's producer, will also reportedly leave Rare, after more than two decades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Microsoft for comment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last Everwild trailer, released in July 2020, carried the following description: "Everwild is a brand new IP from Rare.

Back in February this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-issues-update-on-rares-long-in-development-everwild">Xbox boss Phil Spencer said he had recently visited the studio to catch up on the game's progress</a>.
