Pretty much every retailer under the sun has already unleashed a whole bunch of deals, so there’s no reason to wait to do your holiday shopping. If you or someone on your list is into Sonic the Hedgehog video games, you’re in luck: a bunch of them are on sale across the Switch, Switch 2, PS5, and Xbox. Here’s a rundown of every Sonic game that’s already on sale for Black Friday 2025.</p><p id="all-the-sonic-black-friday-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="All the Sonic Black Friday deals">Sonic Games - Black Friday Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no shortage of Sonic game deals for Black Friday. Here’s the full list.</p><p id="sonic-racing-crossworlds"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</h2></p><div catalogid="c03dea71-f833-49ee-b6ce-536ef4f193be" id="231690"><div id="231690" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds (Switch, PS5, XSX)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The newest game on the list is Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds (Amazon), a kart racer with enough speed and new ideas that many think is actually better than Mario Kart World. In her <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review">review</a>, Jada Griffin wrote, “Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds fires on all cylinders with a fantastic roster of 24 of my favorite hedgehogs, foxes, echidnas, and more. The lineup of 24 main tracks and 15 Crossworld tracks is the best designed selection we've ever gotten in any Sonic racing game, and there is a generationally great soundtrack to accompany them. The racing itself feels fast, fantastic, and intuitive, with lots of options to tweak your stats to your preferred playstyle.”</p></div><p id="sonic-superstars"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sonic Superstars">Sonic Superstars</h2></p><div catalogid="c03dea71-f833-49ee-b6ce-536ef4f193be" id="231685"><div id="231685" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic Superstars (Switch, PS5, XSX)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If price is your main consideration, you can’t beat Sonic Superstars, a throwback side-scrolling platformer you can pick up for <em>less than $10</em> at <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5Xexj?object_uuid=6c202e83-fe55-40f3-a997-cfcf194f667b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>. That’s a killer deal on a game about which the very same Jada Griffin, in her <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-superstars-review">review</a>, said, “Most Sonic games put the pedal to the metal, having you travel at blindingly fast speeds while avoiding hazards on your way to the goal. Unlike its predecessors, however, Sonic Superstars trades that traditional breakneck pace for new abilities, more exploration, multiple mini-games, and slightly more challenging bosses. Most of that stylistic shift works well for the majority of Superstars’ roughly 15-hour multi-campaign story.”</p></div><p id="sonic-x-shadow-generations"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sonic X Shadow Generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</h2></p><div catalogid="c03dea71-f833-49ee-b6ce-536ef4f193be" id="231686"><div id="231686" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic X Shadow Generations (Switch 2, Switch, PS5, XSX)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to those, you can pick up the excellent 2024 game Sonic X Shadow Generations for the new all-time low price of $24.99 at <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao6kZg?object_uuid=6c202e83-fe55-40f3-a997-cfcf194f667b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>. That’s for all consoles, including Switch 2. This game is comprised of two parts. One is a remake of the 2011 game Sonic Generations, and the other is a brand-new Shadow-centered addition. It adds up to a killer package we gave 9/10 in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sonic is far from the only game series getting Black Friday discounts.

Most Hunters have fixed power levels, but Sung Jinwoo is unique: he can level up. And he’s on a mission to become the world’s strongest Hunter and the Ultimate Monarch of Shadows.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can guide him through that mission in Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE’s Story Mode, which includes an adaptation of the original story as well as new adventures that are unique to the game. You can customize his appearance, abilities, and play style through the course of the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His biggest strength is his versatility. He can learn just about anything and is constantly growing and evolving. Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE puts you in charge of determining that growth, including four initial job choices and a skill tree that allows for flexibility in creating your own playstyle.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He can wield several different types of weapons, and you’re able to swap between them on the fly to chain attacks together and build combos. There are also timing-based parries and dodges you can use to cancel or avoid damage and then unleash counterattacks to keep the pace of combat flowing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your play style will change depending on the combination of weapons and skills you choose, giving you the opportunity to test a lot of different styles and seeing what suits you. And by charging the Monarch’s Awakening gauge, Sung Jinwoo can transform into his Shadow Monarch form, which has a completely different set of skills to use against enemies.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sung Jinwoo might be the protagonist, but he’s not the only character you can play as. You’ll recruit other Hunters that fans of the Solo Leveling series will recognize, each with their own personalities and powers, and you can play as them in certain Hunter dungeons. You can also join up to three friends in co-op raids that will see you face off with some of the toughest commanders from the series. In those raids, you can play as either Jinwoo or one of the other available Hunters, and they all have their own skill set and attack patterns to master.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Story Mode and multiplayer content of Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE are both included in the base purchase price of $39.99, which is available now in full<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2373990/Solo_Leveling_ARISE_OVERDRIVE/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"> <u>on Steam</u></a> and Xbox PC.
