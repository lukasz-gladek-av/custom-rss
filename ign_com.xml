            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls 6 may be the next big brand new video game announced by Bethesda to be in the works, but Fallout is the franchise the studio is doing the most in right now, Todd Howard has told IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout Season 2 is set to hit Prime Video this month, and while Bethesda has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle-announced-on-fallout-day-here-are-the-contents"><u>a new Fallout: New Vegas bundle</u></a>, there’s no word yet on a Fallout remaster or a Fallout: New Vegas 2 to capitalize on the surge of interest in the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no mention made during the recent Fallout Day broadcast of a Fallout: New Vegas remaster, which some (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remaster-new-vegas-boss-danny-trejo-calls-on-bethesda-to-give-fallout-fans-what-they-really-want"><u>including Danny Trejo!</u></a>) had called on Bethesda to develop. Indeed, there were no new Fallout games announced at all. Find out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-day-2025-everything-announced-live"><u>everything announced during the Fallout Day broadcast here</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are all sorts of rumors floating around about potential Fallout remakes now that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is out the door (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>Fallout 3 Remastered was leaked back in 2023</u></a>, but those plans may have changed). And we know Bethesda wants to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5"><u>Fallout 5</u></a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last we heard on Fallout 5, by the way, was back in June 2024, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success"><u>Todd Howard said he wasn’t interested in rushing it out the door</u></a>. Fast forward a year and a half, and IGN had the chance to quiz Todd Howard on all things Fallout, alongside Kevin Beatty, Head of Product for Samsung Gaming, Interactive Experiences, and Emerging Tech (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/watch-prime-videos-fallout-season-1-for-free-from-today-on-samsung-tv-plus">Bethesda and Xbox recently announced a partnership with Amazon and Samsung to stream Season 1 for free on Samsung TV Plus ahead of Season 2</a>). In the interview, Howard remained coy when asked directly about a number of unannounced projects, but did offer a tantalizing tease that should get Fallout fans excited.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We started by asking Howard if the explosive success of the Fallout TV show had caused Bethesda to alter its plans for new Fallout games, either creatively or timeline-wise. Howard denied that, saying Bethesda already had a plan for the Fallout games it wanted to make.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No, it hasn't,” he replied. “We had a plan for the games we were going to make. The TV show was part obviously of our Fallout plan as far as a franchise. And in a lot of ways, I view it as an entry, as a game entry. Games are one lens into the world, the TV show is another lens into the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The one thing it has led us to do is people are coming back to the games that are already available. So, you're seeing record numbers again back in Fallout 4, from the first season, again, in this season. Fallout 76 obviously is a game that we've continued to update for the last seven years. So that's probably the one where we really see engaged audiences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, the one thing it's made us do is lean into that. We know that we have an audience there in that game in particular. And the Burning Springs update that just came out, and having Walton Goggins in the game is The Ghoul, just there's some really, really good opportunities there.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2: Who's Confirmed to Return and Who's New?</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We then asked Howard if Bethesda being owned by Microsoft had made it likely that the company might partner with, for example, Obsidian, developer of the original Fallout: New Vegas, or Wasteland developer inXile — both of which are Xbox studios — on a new Fallout: New Vegas game while fans wait for Fallout 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, Howard was coy in his response. “We've had a long-term plan for Fallout, and so I wish I could talk about all those today,” he said. “I'll just say this, it's the franchise that we're doing the most in right now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That cryptic tease at the end will be of interest to The Elder Scrolls fans patiently waiting for The Elder Scrolls 6 to come out. While that game is clearly of a big focus internally at Bethesda, it’s interesting to learn that there’s a lot more going on for Fallout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally on this topic, we asked Howard if the success of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which has seen over 4 million players since it shadow-dropped earlier this year, was a repeatable trick for a Fallout 3 Remastered. Howard once again kept his cards close to his chest, and reiterated a point he’s been making a lot in interviews lately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I will just say that the Oblivion Remaster, we're really, really pleased with how well it did, it was a very long project too, and not just in how it was received, the ability to shadow drop it, and the response to doing that,” he said. “I like to do that with games as much as possible. I love the moment that you find out about a game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Howard continued: “And I like to think about when somebody presses play, what is in their head? What do they think? What is their expectation? What's their excitement level? What do they think about the thing they're about to play? And so, I like to back up from that moment with how we talk about it, and sometimes there are big gaps.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big gaps indeed. The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which was released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76. While fans flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG over time (and after a rocky launch), it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series leveled up in terms of attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Another day, another leak ahead of The Game Awards 2025 — which is set to feature a look at what's next for Tomb Raider heroine Lara Croft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of time, cover artwork has leaked for Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, what looks to be a full remake of the franchise's original game. There are stills from a new trailer, too, showing Lara Croft in action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Croft's design here appears to be a blend of the character's 'classic' design with her look from the franchise's more recent reboot trilogy, which showcased her origins. It's presumed that this remake will fully position the series' first Tomb Raider adventure as taking place after that trilogy, as had always been suggested.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Universo PlayStation (@PlayVerso) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayVerso/status/1999030562988896669?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">More screenshots of the new Tomb Raider, it looks like a TR1 remake <a href="https://t.co/BvmiNrMdAt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/BvmiNrMdAt</a></p>— Tarada (Ash)Croft (@JesuisJanice) <a href="https://twitter.com/JesuisJanice/status/1998953872933662761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">After the images leaked online last night via video game forum <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-leak-spoilers-potential-box-art-and-some-info-of-tr1-remake-%E2%80%9Cretelling%E2%80%9D-has-leaked.1379143/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>, fans quickly noted that Croft's box art pose perfectly matches that seen in The Game Awards' official social media <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1998093291594883300" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">teaser</a> for tonight, where she is stood atop a rock, with one arm outstretched, iconic dual pistols raised. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-will-be-at-the-game-awards-this-week">The Game Awards' teaser boasted of "a look at the future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises"</a> and tagged in the official Tomb Raider account, but is a remake really all that's in the works? It seems unlikely. Replying to the leak via ResetEra, noted gaming tipster <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-tomb-raider-announcement-confirmed-for-the-game-awards.1376347/post-148669696" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shinobi602</a> suggested that multiple projects would be shown tonight, and fans would not be disappointed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics has been working now for several years on its next chapter of the franchise. Here's hoping we get some word of that tonight too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-tomb-raider-unreal-engine-5-crystal-dynamics">First announced in 2022</a>, we are yet to see anything of the all-new Tomb Raider, though we did <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-dev-reveals-lara-crofts-official-redesign">get a look at the Lara Croft redesign last year</a>. Meanwhile, it has been a turbulent time for Crystal Dynamics with three waves of layoffs this year, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-30-more-workers-in-third-wave-of-cuts-this-year">30 individuals last month</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-more-following-perfect-dark-cancelation">an unknown number of workers in August</a> following the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">cancellation of Perfect Dark by Xbox</a>, and<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-employees" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 17 people earlier in the year</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-is-latest-embracer-studio-to-suffer-layoffs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 others back in 2023.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside all this, we know there's a live-action Tomb Raider series in the works at Amazon in partnership with Story Kitchen, starring Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner as Lara Croft. The show will, per Story Kitchen, "reinvent the franchise on a massive scale" and will interconnect "live-action television series and video games into a unified storytelling universe." How will it all connect? What else is in the works? We may well find out more tonight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
