"Modify existing content or create new experiences — animations, weapons, mechanics, and even wonders of the Zone."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sounds great, right? Which it is, if you happen to have 700GB of space free… on <em>top</em> of the 160GB you need to run the base game itself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason, GSC said, is because as part of its partnership with the modding community, the team is sharing a slew of uncompressed files so modders are using original assets in the development of their mods, which is better for everyone, of course. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The size of the mod kit is a result of the in-game assets being uncompressed for the mod makers," GSC told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/wanna-make-mods-for-stalker-2-thatll-be-700-gb-of-hard-drive-space-please/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PC Gamer</u></a>. "It's a big game, and the assets are many, resulting in a considerable size of the download. The Zone Kit is currently in phase one, so we'll explore the opportunities to optimize its size (if possible) in the future."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah, we launched the Zone Kit as Phase 1, because we want to develop it together with Mod Makers," a community representative explained on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1lk2rgf/comment/mzojm1h/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit</u></a>. "It already has a lot of features, but still this is Phase 1. On Phase 2 there will be even more things to do with the Zone via the Zone Kit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Underneath the technical problems that plague STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a unique greatness," we wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review"><u>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl review</u></a>, giving it 8/10.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation 5 owners who have already completed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> report a surprising inclusion within the Sony-published game's credits: Nintendo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, the company listed within the credits is Nintendo Pictures, the Mario maker's motion capture studio it bought and rebranded in 2022.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the first time that Nintendo Pictures has been credited as having contributed to a non-Nintendo game since it was acquired, though as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-owned-company-worked-on-death-stranding-2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a> reports, there may be a good reason why.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Death Stranding 2 development was underway in 2022, around the time Nintendo snapped up the company, previously known as Dynamo Pictures. Indeed, the game's reveal trailer, shown at The Game Awards 2022, features a first look at scenes with Norman Reedus and Lea Seydoux that look to have been shot using motion capture.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems probable, then, that Nintendo Pictures (or rather, Dynamo Pictures) was simply signed onto the project before Nintendo's purchase, and continued work on it per its contract. The company previously worked on the original Death Stranding, so it seems likely its services were retained relatively early.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Pictures staff members who worked on Death Stranding 2 include a motion capture director, numerous motion capture editors, motion capture coordinators, and a motion capture advisor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the acquisition, Nintendo Pictures has otherwise focused entirely on projects from its namesake, including Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Pikmin 4, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Whether the company will work on any other non-Nintendo projects now remains to be seen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting started with Death Stranding 2?
