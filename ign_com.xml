The studio has released two expansions for Alan Wake 2 this year that have likely helped - <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-2-night-springs-expansion-announced-releasing-tomorrow-sgf-2024">Night Springs</a> and, more recently, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/alan-wake-ii-lake-house-expansion-reveal-trailer-state-of-play-2024">The Lake House</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alan Wake 2 shifting to generating royalties seems inevitable, and will likely be a big deal for Remedy. It's the company's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-2-remedys-fastest-selling-game-so-far">fastest-selling game so far</a>, selling 1.3 million copies as of March 20 this year. Currently, the company's only major sources of ongoing revenue are sales of Control and older Alan Wake games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, it's getting infusions of cash from partner companies for the purpose of developing more games. For instance, Annapurna Pictures <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-movies-on-the-way-thanks-to-new-annapurna-partnership">recently entered into a partnership</a> with the studio that will fund 50% of the development of Control 2, while Annapurna creates film and TV spin-offs of Control and Alan Wake. Remedy reports that Control 2 development is on track to start full production in 2025, with a number of critical features already implemented.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Remedy's other games in progress, Codename Condor, Remedy's multiplayer Control spin-off, was announced recently as FBC: Firebreak. Remedy reports that Firebreak is still in full production, and focused on iterating on the core loop and implementing UI for player clarity based on playtesting feedback. Meanwhile, Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remake is making "steady progress" in full production.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Alan Wake 2: Night Springs DLC Reveal Trailer Screenshots - Summer Game Fest 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For the quarter, Remedy reported revenue up 128.6% year-over-year to â‚¬17.9 million ($19.4 million), largely due to the one-time payment from Annapurna Pictures to develop Control, as well as other development fees taken from other sources.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alan Wake 2 itself seems excellent, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-review">netting a 9/10 from our reviewer</a> who called it "a superb survival horror sequel that makes the cult-classic original seem like little more than a rough first draft by comparison." Its most recent DLC, The Lake House, is also excellent, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-2-dlc-has-what-looks-like-a-pretty-big-teaser-for-control-2">appears to be teasing Control 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
