            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Shoot, loot, and level up with these codes.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pixel Quest is a brand new 2D bullet hell RPG, where you'll face an onslaught of foes across biomes that range from the beach to the desert. The Third Dimension has been destroyed by 1x1x1x1, and now the Robloxians will need to work together to protect the pixelated 2D land of Robloxia. There are over 70 quests to complete, and legendary loot to obtain that will make it far easier to eviscerate hordes of enemies. With so much to do, you'll want some codes to make use of.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Working Pixel Quest Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are all the currently active Pixel Quest codes. Be sure to redeem them before they expire!</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>LUCKYDAY</strong> - 1x Gold Clover, 2x EXP Booster, 1x Medium Dungeon Key, 3x Defense Infusion</li><li><strong>PQDISCORD2025</strong> - Wumpus Skin</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Use Pixel Quest Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Redeeming Pixel Quest codes is a straightforward process. Launch the experience and complete the tutorial if you haven't already done so. When you're in the main hub, here are the steps you need to follow:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Locate the chat box on the bottom left of the screen. It says "To chat click here or press / key".</li><li>Click or press the / key and then press / again. This will bring up a list of commands.</li><li>Type code, so it now says /code in your text box.</li><li>Copy and paste the code from the article and enter it into the box, <strong>e.g. /code PQDISCORD2025</strong></li><li>Hit enter.</li><li>You'll then see a message in the chat that tells you if the code has been redeemed successfully, and what the reward is.</li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Claim Gifts from You Gift Box</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Some codes will give you rewards that you need to claim from your Giftbox. On the righthand side of the screen, you'll see a yellow and red gift box. Click on this and you'll be automatically transported to the southeast corner of the main hub. The Gift Box menu will also automatically open, so you can drag them into your inventory.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Find Skins</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you receive a skin via a code, then you'll want to find the icon on the left side of the screen that shows a person and says Wardrobe. When you open the Wardrobe, you'll see three sub-menus: Skins, Badges, and Titles. You can then scroll through and see any Skins, you've unlocked.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Expired Pixel Quest Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You're in luck! There are currently no expired Pixel Quest codes, but don't let the above ones slip away before you use them.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Isn't My Pixel Quest Code Working?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Codes for Roblox experiences are usually case-sensitive, so the best way to ensure you've got a working code is to directly copy it from this article. We check all codes before we upload them, so you can guarantee they're working. Just double-check that you haven't copied over an extra space!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When Is the Next Pixel Quest Update?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Pixel Quest is currently in Alpha release, but that doesn't mean that the Pixel Quest! group isn't already working hard to bring new content to the RPG. The next update is planned for Sunday, 26th October. This mini update will introduce a new dungeon and new Legendary items.
