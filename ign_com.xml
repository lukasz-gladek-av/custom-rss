Steam concurrent player numbers, which do not tell the whole story of a game’s popularity, were worryingly low.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Story-driven action adventure game MindsEye was initially designed to be a part of Everywhere, the ‘Roblox for adults’ creation platform led by former Grand Theft Auto design chief Leslie Benzies. BARB eventually switched to focus on MindsEye, but it has so-far failed to do the business for the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, Benzies told staff that the studio would bounce back and relaunch MindsEye, blaming its struggles on internal and external saboteurs, among other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post to the MindsEye community issued today, September 5, BARB said “we remain committed to refining MindsEye and enhancing the gameplay experience. Ongoing updates will continue to be shared.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, Update 4 introduces a range of UX improvements, numerous performance enhancements, and tackles bugs. Update 4 is significant in terms of size, weighing in at 15GB on PC, 7.2GB on PS5, and 12.1GB on Xbox Series X and S. Update 5 will deliver a "major" performance, combat and enemy AI system improvement, BARB teased.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, the CEO of MindsEye publisher IO Interactive, which is working on 007 First Light, responded to the game’s launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch">telling IGN</a>: “that was definitely tough, right?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is whether BARB can save MindsEye by encouraging players not just to come back to the game, but to actually buy it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MindsEye Update 4 Patch
