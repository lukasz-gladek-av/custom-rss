            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-update-adds-new-boss-rush-mode-journeyers-chart-and-plenty-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> developer Game Science has issued a new update for the record-breaking action game, adding a number of new features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Update 1.0.12.16581 adds a new boss rush mode called Challenge, which can be found at any Keeper’s Shrine after beating the game at least once. Two types of challenge are available: Return of Rivals and Gauntlet of Legends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Return of Rivals lets players challenge a defeated boss to a duel, choosing from three levels of difficulty. Gauntlet of Legends lets players fight against multiple opponents in succession, using customized curses to tailor the difficulty. As with Return of Rivals, if any opponents remain undefeated in the main game, the related gauntlet will be unavailable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This mode can be difficult, as some old opponents may surprise with new moves,” Game Science warned in a <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>. “Proceed with caution!” There are unique rewards tied to Challenge, detailed below in the patch notes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the patch adds the new Journeyer's Chart, which is unlocked when the player first enters Black Wind Mountain and meets the Keeper. Afterwards, for each new territory reached, a Journeyer's Chart can be bought at the Keeper's Shrine. There’s new equipment, too, to celebrate the upcoming Chinese New Year, and new music library functions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-dev-game-science-teases-surprises-for-later-this-year">Game Science teased “some surprises” for Black Myth: Wukong</a>. Accepting the Game of the Year award via video message at the Golden Joysticks, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji encouraged people who have yet to buy the smash hit action game to now do so. He then added the tease: “Of course, you might have already completed our game. That’s perfectly fine too. Keep following us, and there might just be some surprises waiting for you later this year.” It seems these new additions, designed for players who have beat Black Myth: Wukong already, are the surprises in question.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Myth: Wukong launched on August 19 and sold an eye-watering 18 million copies in just two weeks across PC and PS5, reportedly making over $700 million in revenue in the process. That was enough to put Black Myth: Wukong up there with Grand Theft Auto 5 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 as one of the fastest-selling games of all time, and is an astonishing return for a game that had a reported budget of $70 million over six years of development. It did so well that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-points-to-black-myth-wukong-success-in-big-playstation-quarter-after-concord-disaster"><u>Sony pointed to Black Myth: Wukong as making a significant contribution to revenue</u></a> during its last financial quarter., making up for the Concord disaster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DLC is set to follow. In September, Game Science investor Hero Games confirmed plans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-following-elden-rings-lead-with-dlc-expansion-before-any-sequel"><u>to release an Elden Ring-style expansion for Black Myth: Wukong ahead of any sequel</u></a>. Perhaps we'll get a first look at The Game Awards 2024 later this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc"><u>Black Myth: Wukong review</u></a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Despite some frustrating technical issues, Black Myth: Wukong is a great action game with fantastic combat, exciting bosses, tantalizing secrets, and a beautiful world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you’re here, IGN has plenty more Black Myth: Wukong guides to help you out, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Essential Tips and Tricks</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Things_Black_Myth_Wukong_Doesn%27t_Tell_You"><u>Things Black Myth: Wukong Doesn't Tell You</u></a>, and our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Boss_List_and_Guides"><u>Boss List and Guides</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Black Myth: Wukong update 1.0.12.16581 patch notes:</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>What to Know Before Patch Installation</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Due to the platform's update mechanism, your computer will need to reserve a larger amount of free disk space for temporary storage of the update files.</li><li>If you have installed any mods in the game, installing the patch may cause compatibility issues.

As NetEase noted, while these issues are largely resolved with today’s patch, the bug may be present elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've had a look at the entire map and have done our best to fix this bug,” <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20241210/41548_1199072.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NetEase said in a blog post</a>. “However, further adjustments may still be needed to fully resolve the issue, so we ask for your understanding while we continue looking into it and working on a way to prevent this from happening again.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase added that it’s keeping an eye on the frequency of different bugs and fixing them “as fast as we can.” Another patch is in the works, this time with new content, the developer promised.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals"><u>Marvel Rivals</u></a> is a smash hit for NetEase, securing 10 million players in just three days. The free-to-play superhero team-based PvP shooter launched on December 6 across PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. While Sony and Microsoft do not make PlayStation or Xbox player numbers public, Steam makes Valve stats available, and it’s there that Marvel Rivals is enjoying a particularly massive release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals peaked over its launch weekend with 480,990 concurrent players, which was enough to put it in Steam’s top five most-played games. It’s the 20th highest concurrent player number ever seen on Steam, ahead of the likes of Helldivers 2, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Destiny 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, Marvel Rivals has a ‘mostly positive’ user review rating, with 76% of the 35,000 reviews tagged as positive. Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review"><u>Marvel Rivals Review in Progress</u></a> to find out what we think. And keep an eye on the latest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-codes">Marvel Rivals codes</a> for free skins, and vote on the strongest Marvel Rivals characters in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/marvel-rivals/Marvel_Rivals_Characters">community tier list</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Marvel Rivals update 20241210 patch notes:</h2><div data-cy="paragraph"><p><strong>All Platforms</strong><br>
<strong>General</strong></p><p>· When playing highlights and recordings, crosshair deviation would be significant, and there was a possibility for lag. This issue has been resolved.<br>· Changing where Highlights were saved would cause the game to crash. This issue has been resolved.<br>· Players joining a Quick Match as a replacement may not be able to see heroes' equipped costumes. This issue has been resolved.<br>· Mission progress on the Season Event screen would not display correctly. This issue has been resolved.<br>· Fixed some textual errors. More fixes will be coming in a future update.<br>· After a crash, the game had a chance to freeze for a long period of time before closing. This issue has been resolved, and now the game will close after crashing.<br>· Fixed some relatively common crash issues.<br>
<strong>Maps &amp; Game Modes
</strong><br>· On certain maps (particularly Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven and Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface), special collisions on the edges would cause the player's character to become stuck or clip through and enter strange areas. These issues have been largely resolved, but as this affects multiple maps and areas, this bug may be present elsewhere. We will work to continue fixing such issues and develop a solution to thoroughly prevent them.</p><p>· In the foggy areas of Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Hall of Djalia and Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Birnin T'Challa:<br>    - Fog would disappear from Hela and Storm's perspectives when they activated their Ultimates. This issue has been resolved.<br>    - After Jeff the Land Shark was revived while in the fog, his teammates and enemies would not be able to see the special effects of Joyful Splash. This issue has been resolved.</p><p>· In Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven - Frozen Airfield:<br>    - In Competitive, if a player was KO’d while moving near a target area, it would cause the lightings to behave abnormally. This issue has been resolved.<br>    - During matches, disconnecting and reconnecting could cause desynchronization of some doors (i.e., a door looked to be closed, but the player could walk through; a door looked to be open, but the player couldn't walk through). This issue has been resolved.</p><p>· Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven - Eldritch Monument:<br>    - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Adam Warlock used his Ultimate, his teammates would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.<br>    - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Thor or Loki were revived by Hela's team-up ability, they would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.<br>    - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Jeff the Land Shark used his Ultimate to devour characters, they would potentially become stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.<br>    - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Winter Soldier hit an enemy with his Ultimate and they landed right on the target area platform, damage may be lost. This issue has been resolved.</p><p>· When switching between rounds in Competitive, if the destination was not the last stage of a map, it would cause the vehicle's effective range to not display when it approached the destination, impacting determination of the effective occupation range. This issue has been resolved.<br>· Upon reaching the third round in Competitive Convoy or Convergence, heroes had a chance to carry over their Ultimate energy from the second round. This issue has been resolved, and heroes will no longer inherit their Ultimate energy.<br>
<strong>Heroes</strong></p><p>· When Wolverine had his Deadpool &amp; Wolverine costume equipped, no ability voice lines other than the Undying Animal ability's line would play. This issue has been resolved.<br>· After Star-Lord's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3's MVP animation played, sound effects would not be played in the results screen. This issue has been resolved.<br>· When Iron Fist used pings, the corresponding voice lines would not be triggered. This issue has been resolved.<br>· The description for ADS sensitivity in Black Widow's settings was incorrect. This issue has been resolved.<br>· In certain situations, Black Widow's Ultimate would not recover energy as intended. This issue has been resolved.<br>· In certain extreme situations, Captain America's Ultimate wouldn't end as intended. This issue has been resolved.<br>· When Doctor Strange's portals triggered terrain KOs, they would mistakenly restore Doctor Strange's Ultimate energy. For now, we have disabled the portals' terrain KO attribution to temporarily fix this issue (i.e., terrain KOs will not count toward Doctor Strange's own KOs). Rest assured, this bug will be resolved in a future update, at which time we will restore the portals' KO attribution.<br>
<strong>PC</strong></p><p>· Using FSR 3 frame generation technology to modify the resolution could cause memory leaks, resulting in blurry models. This issue has been resolved.</p><p>———————————————————————————————————————<br>
<strong>Console</strong></p><p>· After equipping the PlayStation bundle's Scarlet Spider costume, restarting the game could cause the costume to not display as correctly equipped. This issue has been resolved.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
