His phantom versions can pop out and surprise you throughout the campaign, and it seems like that particular facet of Morgott made it into Nightreign, where an unnamed Fell Omen (essentially an upgraded Morgott) can jump-scare invade players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Morgott isn't the only boss that can invade your squad as you run through Nightreign, he is a very fitting invader. Not only does it line up with his surprise appearances in Elden Ring, but he even gets some extra voice lines and a few new moves to throw at you. If you get to bring two pals to the fight, it's only fair Morgott gets some new moves!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While he can invade you, the Fell Omen can also appear as an end-of-night boss, one of the conclusive fights you can face as the sun sets in the Elden Ring Nightreign test.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">How did morgott even manage to sneak into nightreign to fight us. generational hater this is like the 5th time <a href="https://t.co/t7euCmkBRy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/t7euCmkBRy</a></p>— Nightreign Countdown (@SoulsCountdowns) <a href="https://twitter.com/SoulsCountdowns/status/1890945931912036486?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Plenty of early testers, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-elden-ring-community-hero">including the player behind Let Me Solo Her</a>, took on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3wS3s5omcW0?si=v92LESpAKaVPlKie&amp;t=2070" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Fell Omen during the Elden Ring Nightreign sessions</a> that took place over the weekend. The consensus? Morgott/Margit/Fell Omen is a great hater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1iqdsxs/strangest_or_most_challenging_locations_to_have/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One player on the Elden Ring Nightreign subreddit</a> described Morgott's invasion mechanic as one of their favorite features, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1iqa3pv/chances_he_can_invade_you_at_any_point_in/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in more threads</a>, others shared where they were invaded. Whether as a night boss, on an elevator, or in a tower, Morgott seems ready to appear wherever, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zulliethewitch.bsky.social/post/3licizequas2i" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with some potentially hilarious consequences</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fell Omen's sudden invasions have hopes high for other enemies to suddenly appear and attack the players. The Pursuer from Dark Souls 2, for example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1iqa3pv/comment/mczm1t4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">would make a great candidate</a>. Me, personally? I'd love to see some Hunters invade and attempt to take out players, but anything Bloodborne-related feels like a distant hope at best.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>They buffed Margit in Elden Ring Nightreign bro was training with Vergil </p><p>Thankful for the one match I was able to play LOL <a href="https://t.co/4RRQGSKmNa" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/4RRQGSKmNa</a></p></div>— skum (@skumnut) <a href="https://twitter.com/skumnut/status/1890540573884301633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">There might even be deeper mechanics to Fell Omen invasions. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/the-random-events-in-elden-ring-nightreign-are-the-funniest-thing-fromsoftwares-ever-cooked-up-from-a-rain-of-ants-to-morgott-jump-scares/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a> detailed an invasion from the Omen that took out one of their co-op partners, and seemed to leave a curse mark branded on the slain player.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-hackers-tear-through-billions-of-possibilities-to-debunk-a-15-year-old-record-speedrun-no-one-thought-could-be-beaten<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Speedrunning has been a time-honored tradition of video game enjoyers for years, with some records being held not just for months or years, but even decades. One particular legendary Diablo run, though, has been the subject of scrutiny, an intense investigation, and now a thorough debunking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2009, Maciej "Groobo" Maselewski recorded an Any% segmented run, as the Sorcerer, made up of 27 segments. The final time, at three minutes and 12 seconds, appeared on Speed Demos Archive, where no concerns were raised, and was subsequently published on February 26, 2009. It would garner two Guinness World Record entries, and Diablo speedrun attempts would proceed to decline as the run seemed nigh-impossible to challenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the years went on, though, scepticism arose. In 2024, speedrunner Funkmastermp approached Allan "dwangoAC" Cecil to create a Tool-Assisted Speedrun, or TAS, of Diablo. Longtime Games Done Quick viewers will recognize dwangoAC as team leader for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/04/sgdqs-most-mindblowing-speedrun-wasnt-humanly-possible">TASBot</a>, the fun mascot that would appear during TAS blocks at GDQ's charity events.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team got to work, and <a href="https://diablo.tas.bot/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as detailed in a lengthy writeup by dwangoAC and other team members</a>, started to discover inconsistencies as they attempted to replicate Groobo's run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We just had a lot of curiosity and resentment that drove us to dig even deeper," team member Staphen told <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-diablo-hackers-that-debunked-a-record-speedrun/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ars Technica in a report detailing their investigation</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because Diablo uses seeds to generate maps, it should theoretically have been possible to replicate Groobo's run. To discover the seed Groobo used, the TAS team <a href="https://github.com/Matthew-petroff/diablo-mapgen" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built a custom map tool</a> that could reverse-engineer game seeds and determine the map, item, and quest possibilities therein. Then, a scanner tool built on top of it could sift through all the seeds and search for dungeons that might suit speedrunners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team searched across roughly 2.2 billion RNG seeds, attempting to recreate Groobo's run, and couldn't find one that imitated all the seemingly perfect generation. It seemed to indicate this wasn't made up of segments from a single file or run, but from different runs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The deeper they dug, the more oddities popped up; strange version markers in the main menu, inconsistent inventories, quests, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a final conclusion, the team said its discoveries demonstrate Groobo used "illegitimate means to produce the results shown in the run," including combining gameplay from different runs, modifying memory, and using "gameplay-removing video splices."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Overall, the team's analysis conclusively reveals the run was not possible as Groobo described without disqualifying modifications," the team said. "The run should therefore be immediately retracted from all leaderboards."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The writeup goes on to detail a response from Groobo, who told <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-hacker-who-hunts-video-game-speedrunning-cheaters/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wired</a>: "My run is a segmented/spliced run. It always has been and it was never passed off as anything else, nor was it part of any competition or leaderboards. The speeddemosarchive page states that outright."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The investigation team presented its analysis to Speed Demos Archive, which then discussed the findings independently with Groobo. On September 10, 2024, SDA posted an update announcing the removal of all Diablo runs by Groobo. The Diablo speedrunning community, meanwhile, kicked back into gear and started setting new records.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At a presentation, as reported by Ars Technica, dwangoAC said he pursued the investigation because "it did harm."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Groobo's alleged cheating in 2009 completely stopped interest in speedrunning this category," Cecil said. "No one tried, no one could."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's a record he set himself last June at one hour, 25 minutes, and 11 seconds. He'd spent days — 72, at the time of this incident — trying to topple his own record.

"That's a new one, dude," he said in a run prior to the big one, where his webcam turned off about one minute and 34 seconds in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The heartbreaker in question would happen after, at 23 minutes and 59 seconds into a really solid run. You can check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svH7ru0XzWQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube VOD</a> of his run to see the chat, in real-time, react. "This could be the funniest WR," one person in chat said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The facecam is crucial because it's required for the run to be valid. On <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/sm64ce?h=Blindfolded-70-star&amp;x=xd17xo7d-38do6x0l.814d20e1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Speedrun.com rules and regulations</a>, it specifically states: "The player must be visibly devoid of sight during the gameplay, i.e. something must be covering the eyes." Ergo, if you couldn't verify Bubzia had his eyes covered the entire time, the run would not qualify.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having a back-up of some kind, like a notification, might be a thought. But the second category-specific rule says runners can't have any assistance from other people. This includes hints from a Discord call or text-to-voice chat. After the first webcam failure, Bubzia confirmed he had "everything disabled" to alert him in case of a failure, and had received multiple Discord DMs trying to catch his attention while running.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some viewers, it might be agonizing to watch someone run a game for over an hour, unaware their attempt has been invalid since the 24-minute mark. Bubzia's chat even leaned into the irony, hoping for the runner to <em>not </em>set a world record, to avoid the heartbreak when the blindfold came off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So in that way, it may have been a relief that Bubzia's time came in a few seconds behind the world record. The pace clock concluded at 1:26:09, almost a full minute behind Bubzia's standing record.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If this would have been world record, I would have cried," Bubzia said, after taking off his blindfold and realizing the facecam had been off. "Dude, I would have quit SM64, man." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can follow more attempts from Bubzia, whose facecam is currently working at the time of this writing, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Bubzia" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on his Twitch here</a>.
