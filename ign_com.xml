            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v"><u>Grand Theft Auto 5</u></a> content creator believes he has finally solved the infamous Mount Chiliad mystery after 12 years of sleuthing, but some members of the community aren’t convinced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played GTA 5 – and there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-5-surpasses-200-million-units-sold"><u>a good chance you have</u></a> – you’ve also likely heard about Mount Chiliad and the notorious UFO Easter Egg associated with it. In September 2013, almost exactly 12 years ago, eager GTA fans booted up Rockstar Games’ latest sandbox to find a trio of main characters, new locations, and a smorgasbord of mysteries to uncover. Evidence of aliens could and still can be found strewn about the Los Santos map, with players able to discover everything from extraterrestrial remains to crashed UFO ships if they know where to look.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/14/mount-chiliad-mural-gta-5-1755189791780.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mount Chiliad Mural. Image captured via Gator Keys' "The End of The Mount Chiliad Mystery" video.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Aliens have been a hot topic for both GTA 5’s in-game citizens and its real-life players, but it’s the mystery atop Mount Chiliad that has sent heads spinning for more than a decade. Those who make the trek up Los Santos’ unmissable rocky mountain will notice a small cavern with a strange diagram that features a maze-like pattern and four distinct markings: a UFO, a cracked egg, a person wearing a jetpack, and an all-seeing eye looking down on Mount Chiliad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After 12 years, most GTA 5 fans still aren’t sure what it all means, but content creator Gator Keys thinks the answer has been in front of us all along.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Signs</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gator Keys, a popular YouTuber who has put on their GTA detective hat to solve some of GTA 5’s greatest mysteries for the last year, dug into what is perhaps the series’ most infamous Easter Egg with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCoHfn9mf4c&amp;t=2s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>their most recent upload</u></a>, titled “This is The End of the Mount Chiliad Mystery.” It’s an eight-minute video with an unfortunately anticlimactic conclusion: GTA 5 players solved the mystery years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsS06Ub3Mkc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>discovered more than a decade ago</u></a>, players who return to the top of Mount Chiliad after achieving 100% completion will be met with a full-on flying saucer – laser beam noises, flashing lights, and all. As an added gag, this UFO, along with some of the others found in the game, features an FIB logo, representing the Grand Theft Auto universe’s parody version of the FBI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The assumption since GTA 5 launched all the way back in 2013 has been that there must be more to the story than just another UFO appearing in the sky. There are, after all, other flying saucers to be discovered around the map, but Gator Key believes it all truly comes back to that FIB logo.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/14/gta-5-ufo-1755189923347.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">UFO with FIB logo in GTA 5. Image captured via Gator Keys' "The End of The Mount Chiliad Mystery" video.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The whole point of this mystery is to tell us a little more,” Gator Key says. “The reason they put a UFO at the top of Mount Chiliad is to show us the FIB logo spinning on the side of it. This means the FIB created these UFOs. They are the aliens. They are the all-seeing eye.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It makes sense – Rockstar is known for using GTA to provide commentary on the real world, and conspiracy theories about aliens play a part in that, too. Just like the players who have obsessed over Mount Chiliad and its connections to life in space, there are those in Los Santos who worship the aliens and tell tales about UFO sightings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also recent comments from former Rockstar designer Ben Hinchliffe to consider. When speaking with <a href="https://youtu.be/R5mzJsGhmr4?si=7fQWCnZcbNeal7cy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GTAVIoclock</u></a> last year, he touched on the great Mount Chiliad mystery, and although he wasn’t directly involved with its creation, he admitted that some Easter Eggs are included “just to mess with people.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Mount Chiliad mystery is a play on real life,” Gator Keys adds. “The fact that the government, the people in power, control the population, and we can hit 100% all we like. We can get to the top of the mountain, but the UFO is still out of reach because we alone are not the all-seeing eye.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">They Live</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It would be disappointing to see 12 years of community effort come down to little more than a misunderstanding, but if Gator Keys is correct, then that’s exactly what happened. It’s an explanation that arrives as little as one year away from the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>Grand Theft Auto 6</u></a>, and it doesn’t even come close to convincing some of the die-hard GTA 5 fans who have combed over Mount Chiliad for years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nonsense. The creator should stop making these types of videos,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/1mk3bvg/comment/n7jeqzy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>individual commented</u></a> in a recent Reddit thread.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He didn't dig far enough.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Explore a vast open world as you try to rebuild an ancient civilization.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The last few years have featured a stream of visually impressive titles from Chinese developers coming at a regular clip. That trend continues with Of Peaks and Tides, an open-world survival sandbox game revealed with a debut trailer Thursday by developer CyancookGames.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Inspired by Eastern mythology, Of Peaks and Tides takes place in Everland, a world the gods abandoned after a long celestial war. The once-thriving civilizations built by mankind’s tribes have been reduced to ashes after 1,000 years of conflict, and the Ascent — a tower that once connected the realms of humans and gods — lies crumbling at the heart of the world.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/13/08-1755112152849.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After the gods departed, the forces of nature they once governed went out of control, leading to natural disasters that prevented civilization from rebuilding. Divine remnants and unique beasts created by the gods now roam the land, posing deadly threats to everyone unlucky enough to come across them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, needless to say, this is a dangerous and magical world, filled with remnants of humanity’s lost glory. You’ll embark on a journey — either solo or with friends — to uncover these remnants, explore the vast open world, and help rebuild the once mighty human tribes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That journey will take you through several biomes, each with their own unique challenges. Lushland is plagued by constant floods, the Gobi Desert is home to Fire Ravens that whip sand dunes into fiery storms, and Mount Nyenchen is beset by endless blizzards.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To help survive these harsh conditions, you’ll need to build yourself a base. You can choose whatever location you want, and you’ll build from scratch using wood and other materials you gather. You can build your base on the ground or in the mountains to use the environment to your advantage … or you can rise above that environment and build on the back of one of Everland’s giant beasts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the world’s beasts can be tamed, from the adorable Owler to the massive Si (pictured below), and each requires a different strategy. Some prefer offerings, while others will only respect shows of strength. The benefits of taming each beast depend on its size. Some can be used as mounts (including flying mounts), but if you successfully tame a big enough beast, you can build your base on top of it — and boom, now you have a mobile base that can travel with you as you explore.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/13/03-1755112369401.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While each of the environments has its own natural disasters, they all have dynamic weather systems that will change as you explore. You’ll deal with rain, snow, fog, and certain terrain types will get special types of weather. But you’ll find the weather can cause unique and unexpected interactions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, if you’re wearing the Lotus Suit (a piece of equipment you can craft), it will bloom when it encounters rain and you’ll suddenly be covered in flowers. And you can use hazards like floods and sandstorms to your advantage, luring beasts into them to weaken them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And as you probably noticed from the screenshots throughout this article, Of Peaks and Tides’ visuals are eye-catching, built in Unreal Engine 5 but maintaining a distinct identity thanks to its Eastern mythology inspirations. The verdant Lushland looks like something pulled from a fairy tale, while snowcapped Mount Nyenchen is treacherous and threatening.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/14/10-1755196332075.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The first trailer and batch of images only give us a brief glimpse of the world, with more reveals and information to come in the future. Of Peaks and Tides is scheduled for release on PC via Steam in 2026, and it’s available to wishlist now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s be real, Magic: The Gathering is complicated. I've been playing it for decades, but knowing how or where to start is intimidating if you haven't – until last year, when a product called the <a href="https://zdcs.link/av4Dw2?object_uuid=52bef2d0-569a-4524-b074-f5960d4916ca&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Foundations Beginner Box</a> finally provided the excellent starting point paper Magic has needed. Now, with a brand <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXLxL?object_uuid=52bef2d0-569a-4524-b074-f5960d4916ca&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">new Beginner Box</a> themed around the game’s upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-avatar-the-last-airbender-where-to-buy">crossover with Avatar: The Last Airbender</a> just a few months away, that inviting front door is being opened up to an even wider audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of the Avatar set’s first look earlier this week, Wizards of the Coast sent me the Avatar Beginner Box to open up and try out for myself. It’s been every bit the flavorful introduction I hoped it would be, full of fun references to the cartoon show and simple but still mechanically interesting cards to ease newcomers in. And with over 100 brand new cards, some of which are unique to this product while others are from the main set, we have a massive amount of spoilers to show off here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You can flip through the slideshow below or watch the video above to see every card in the Avatar: The Last Airbender Beginner Box:</strong></p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Card in the Avatar: The Last Airbender Beginner Box - Magic: The Gathering</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve already tried the Foundations Beginner Box, this is pretty much the exact same thing with new cards and an Avatar-themed coat of paint – and if you haven’t, or are simply an Avatar fan who is dipping a toe into Magic for the first time, this is genuinely a great place to get started. It comes with 10 differently themed Jumpstart decks, each of which is essentially half of a 40-card deck so that you and a friend can each grab two, shuffle them together, and play against each other on even footing. It also comes with a simplified rule book (trust me, you don’t need to start off with the comprehensive rules), two fold-out playmats to give you a sense of how the game is laid out, and some dice and tokens to keep track of other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are 120 total nonland cards in the Beginner Box, 50 of which have the TLE set code, which is represented by the set symbol that looks like Aang’s Glider (47 are brand new, while three are existing cards reprinted with new Avatar art). These cards are <em>not</em> part of the main set, instead only legal in places like Commander or other formats where they were already playable. The rest of the cards are from the main Avatar set, which has the set code TLA and a set symbol that looks like Aang’s head. Those <em>are</em> legal in Standard, with only four reprints and a handful of duplicates across the 10 theme options. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s hard to think of a better place for Avatar fans to start than this.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The real brilliance of the Beginner Box is how two of those Jumpstart decks are actually designed as a guided tutorial of sorts to show you and another player the ropes. They come stacked in a specific order and aren’t meant to be shuffled ahead of your first game, with each player getting their own guide book full of instructions to follow. These walk you through a mostly scripted game, complete with cute little word bubbles from Avatar characters discussing it on some of the pages. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not like playing that on-rails match is particularly exciting, but by taking a note out of a lot of board game rule books that do something similar, the Beginner Box is able to provide a foundation of understanding that is a truly effective learning tool. Magic has a lot of moving parts that are mostly invisible, relying on the players to track things like the phases of a turn or who has an opportunity to act at any given time – it’s a big reason why my go-to recommendation for learning the game has long been to download the MTG Arena digital client and play through that tutorial online since it handles those things for you. (And, to be fair, that is still quite a good way to learn.) But there’s just something satisfying about learning to play this paper game with paper cards, and that tutorial match sets you up for success in a way Magic has largely lacked offline. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also important that the Beginner Box isn’t <em>just</em> a tutorial as those introductory decks then become a part of the 10 half-deck pool, letting you mix and match themes, like pairing a green deck full of big creatures with a black deck all about going on the offensive. The idea of set packets like this isn’t anything new to Magic (Avatar is even getting its own proper Jumpstart release as well), but when the deck building of constructed formats like Standard or Commander can have a higher barrier of entry and the knowledge required for limited formats like Draft can be intimidating, it continues to be one of the most intuitive and approachable ways to enjoy Magic early on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, most of the praise I’ve slung so far is true of the original Beginner Box, too. What sets this one apart is obviously its Avatar flavor. As a huge fan of the show, it was a delight to recognize so many loving references across these decks – from different takes on characters like Aang or Sokka, to goofy moments like the one on the card How To Start a Riot from the show's Boiling Rock episodes. There are more of Avatar’s iconic hybrid animals than I can count, clever callbacks to some of my favorite moments, and friendly (or menacing) faces in every hand you draw. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, I don’t think any of these cards are going to light the competitive world on fire or anything, but they aren’t supposed to. They’re relatively simple takes on these people and places, meant to bridge the gap between Avatar fans and its Magic set. A card like Path to Redemption, which basically imprisons an opposing creature until you pay to essentially turn into an Ally, isn’t the strongest version of this sort of effect we’ve ever seen, but it is an incredibly neat way to tell part of Uncle Iroh’s story. It’s the kind of thing that helps make what Magic is trying to do flavor-wise make sense.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other cards make more direct references with their tie-ins, particular when it comes to bending. Water, earth, fire, and airbending are all represented in both the main set and the Beginner Box, each offering a different take on what they mechanically look like in Magic. Waterbending, earthbending, and firebending even have Jumpstart decks here specifically named after them that are blue, green, and red, respectively. Those colors make sense, with airbending also intuitively making an appearance in one of the white half-decks, but they don’t seem to be <em>restricted</em> to them either, with some Earthbending showing up in black in this product and some other color blending happening in the main set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, using one of Magic’s Universes Beyond crossovers as the theme for a new version of the Beginner Box seems like a great idea. Wizards of the Coast has talked a lot about how many new folk these tie-ins bring to the game, with the recent Final Fantasy set <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-expansion-made-200-million-in-just-one-day"><u>blowing away even the loftiest of expectations</u></a>. So, if you’re an Avatar fan who is curious about what this crossover entails but is intimidated by the three-decade old reputation Magic carries around with it, it’s hard to think of a better place to start than this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.
