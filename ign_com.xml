            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">These are going to sell out fast.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With the build-up to the next <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-october-2025-dates-announced">big Amazon Prime exclusive sale</a> (Prime Big Deal Days, or October Prime Day, as it's better known) well underway, we're already starting to see some notable early discounts that you should <em>absolutely</em> consider snapping up ASAP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That now includes a handful of new Nintendo Switch 2 games down to record low prices at Amazon, including <a href="https://zdcs.link/911rNx?object_uuid=824ca160-3573-4745-a58d-92076ec50881&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Donkey Kong Bananza, down to $53.54</a> (previously $69.99). Other discounted games include Cyberpunk 2077, Mario Kart World, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Breath of the Wild, with the additional discount automatically applied during checkout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what's the catch? These are technically sold under <strong>Amazon Resale</strong>. Now hold your eye rolls, as we've seen deals like this before, and these discounts are some of the IGN Deals team's most anticipated offers going into the biggest sale period of the year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of what I'm recommending in the sale is classified as "Used - Like New," essentially what Amazon deems almost brand new, never used, with small damage to the packaging, but not to the contents themselves. So you're not losing anything, or buying a game that looks like it's been recently run over repeatedly. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've also already noted some PlayStation deals at Amazon Resale, with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-portal-deal-amazon-resale">PS Portal dropping to around $140</a> (but now sold out), and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-dualsense-edge-controller-deal-amazon-resale">DualSense Edge controller</a>, also down to around $140 right now (also likely to sell out soon). In case you hadn't already realised, the main with kind of deals is stock tends to be extremely limited, so be fast to the trigger if you don't want the disappointment of missing out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of the best ways to buy into some of the most expensive new games available, and find rare discounts where you normally wouldn't (I'm looking at you, Nintendo). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, you still get the 30-day Amazon return policy, so it's still a much safer option than just buying a used game off some random on Facebook Marketplace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, if you're looking for more Switch 2 game deals, we also recently covered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-games-on-sale-at-amazon-including-discounts-on-sonic-and-more">discounts on other games sold by Amazon this week</a> (not resale either), including Split Fiction, Sonic x Shadow Generations, Madden NFL 26, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Sony seeks an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tencent has hit back at Sony's lawsuit that claimed upcoming game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/light-of-motiram">Light of Motiram</a> was nothing more than a "slavish clone" of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> — and highlighted concerns within the PlayStation maker that its own game was too similar to Enslaved: Odyssey to the West.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a fresh response to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-is-suing-tencent-over-shameless-horizon-knock-off-game-light-of-motiram">Sony's legal action</a>, Chinese tech giant Tencent branded the lawsuit as an "impermissible" attempt to claim ownership of "well-trodden" tropes — such as a red-headed heroine fighting robot dinosaurs — and a bid by Sony to gain a monopoly over an entire genre. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition, Tencent highlighted past comments made by Horizon Zero Dawn developer Jan-Bart Van Beek, where the art director admitted concerns within Guerrilla that its concept was too similar to Ninja Theory's 2013 game Enslaved: Odyssey to the West — another example of a red-headed heroine fighting robot beasts.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a legal filing reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-monopoly-genre-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Post</a>, Tencent described Sony's move as an overreach, and highlighted other game franchises with similar elements to Horizon Zero Dawn such as The Legend of Zelda and Far Cry. It was "startling," Tencent said, that Sony was now attempting to claim Horizon's concept was original, rather than an idea based on "ubiquitous genre ingredients."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"By suing over an unreleased project that merely employs the same time-honored tropes embraced by scores of other games released both before and after Horizon — like Enslaved, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Far Cry: Primal, Far Cry: New Dawn, Outer Wilds, Biomutant, and many more — Sony seeks an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions," Tencent wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony's claim that Horizon was an original PlayStation concept was also "flatly contradicted" by remarks made in a behind-the-scenes documentary by Van Beek, Tencent stated, claiming that Guerrilla had briefly shelved work on Horizon Zero Dawn due to internal concerns it shared too many similarities with Enslaved.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Light of Motiram Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Long before this lawsuit was filed, the developers of Horizon Zero Dawn publicly acknowledged that the very same game elements that, today, Sony claims to own exclusively, were in fact borrowed from an earlier game," Tencent argued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Mr. Van Beek warned, 'I don’t think we should do this; it touches too much of these other points,' referring to prominent elements of Enslaved. Sony shelved the project — only to revive it later with full awareness that the idea was far from novel. When Horizon Zero Dawn finally launched in 2017, the gaming community noted its striking resemblance to Enslaved and other genre staples."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tencent's rebuttal attempts to dismiss other elements of Sony's lawsuit, too, by stating that its work on Light of Motiram was unconnected to a failed pitch meeting with Sony for a Horizon spin-off. Tencent has also claimed that Sony's entire lawsuit is invalid because the company had named the wrong parts of Tencent in its initial complaint.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, while attempting to defend itself from Sony's legal action, it is notable that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tencent-quietly-changes-light-of-motirams-steam-page-assets-following-horizon-sony-lawsuit">Tencent has also seemingly made adjustments to the work-in-progress Light of Motiram itself</a>. A glance at the game's Steam page shows it has been scrubbed of screenshots and logos that depicted its redheaded star and those robot dinosaurs. The suggestion here is that Tencent plans to ultimately release Light of Motiram without the elements Sony has deemed most similar to Horizon. It'll be interesting to see how Sony responds to these apparent alterations when it issues its rebuttal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
