            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">While we eagerly await <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> to give us a good scare next year, Amazon's dropped an excellent deal on a slightly older Resi title that's worth picking up to keep you on your toes in the meantime. The excellent <a href="https://zdcs.link/92bwrD?object_uuid=86fda286-9bfb-456e-81a4-4e03ee15b959&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0BJTKYLCB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil 4 remake for PS5</a> has dropped to just $15 at the retailer. Yes, you read that correctly! This marks its lowest price yet, according to price tracker <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0BJTKYLCB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">camelcamelcamel</a>, making now an excellent time to scoop it up for your library if you haven't had the chance to yet.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 4 for PS5 Down to $15 at Amazon</h2><div catalogid="d12ece05-313e-4735-a9f7-07d3b6e19435" id="209855"><div id="209855" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Resident Evil 4 - PS5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering when it first came out it was listed for $59.99, this makes for a 75% discount from that original price, which is an incredible amount of savings for a game we absolutely adored (awarding a shining <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-review">10/10 in our review</a>). IGN's Tristan Ogilvie said at the time that, "Its combat is friction-free but no less stress-inducing thanks to its ferocious cast of creatures, its story rapidly shuttles through a series of action scenes that are diverse in structure but uniformly unwavering in intensity, and its world is rich in detail and full of fun and often snarling surprises."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've yet to add it to your libary, there's truly no better time than now to do it. Especially considering <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-officially-revealed-at-summer-game-fest-2025">Resident Evil: Requiem is set to arrive next year in February</a>. Plus, with spooky season right around the corner, now is the perfect time to have a scary game ready to play when October hits.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight: Silksong is out now, and seems like it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-review">pretty good so far</a> if our review-in-progress is any indication. But it commits one terrible, unforgiveable sin: Silksong won't let players pet the dang dog-er, well, the bug that's <em>like</em> a dog.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Warning: Spoilers for the first few hours of Hollow Knight: Silksong follow. Everything we discuss below can be found very early in the game, in the first two areas you visit.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're still wondering who or what the "dog" is, I'm referring to the Bell Beast, one of Silksong's earliest bosses and, once defeated, your permanent fast travel buddy. The Bell Beast is encountered early in the game in The Marrow, trapped within enormous silk webs. You need to unlock the Silk Spear to free it, and once you do, a fight will ensue. We've got a whole guide on this guy if you're having trouble finding or defeating him, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Bell_Beast_Boss_Guide">so make sure to check that out</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you beat the Bell Beast, it becomes docile, and you can summon it at any fast travel station to have it take you to any other station in Pharloom. That in itself is helpful enough, but the absolute best thing about the Bell Beast is how it basically acts like a big puppy whenever it sees you. It'll dig around in the bells beneath its feet, react excitedly when you ring the bells above its head, and genuinely just gives off enormous puppy energy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>But Hornet can't pet it. </em>And fans really feel like they should be able to! Here's a gallery of a lot of community members agreeing with me - they're all spoiler-tagged due to the Silksong subreddit's current spoiler rules, but I promise, it's all just a bunch of cute images of the Bell Beast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just look at that baby!! It deserves all the scritches and cuddles! Please, Team Cherry, give us a pet action on the Bell Beast. B.B. has earned it...and we have too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight: Silksong is out now, and we're <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong">hard at work on our Wiki guides</a> of everything you might possibly want to know as you start your adventures in Pharloom. We've also got a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-review">review-in-progress covering our thoughts so far</a> that we'll update with a score as soon as we've finished the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
