            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">XD released Sword of Convallaria, a tactical RPG for iOS, Android, and PC to audiences in the west in August ’24 (around a year after the game’s East Asian launch). Heavily influenced by Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics, the game has captivated fans with its meticulously crafted war story and highly strategic battles, all played out to a beautiful soundtrack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just over a year following its release, a truly major collaboration between Sword of Convallaria: For This World of Peace and CD PROJEKT RED's open-world RPG The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has been fully realised and delivered to gamers. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEGNfoSPAXg?si=7s8jqQG1yfoKBR-5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Geralt, Yennefer, Triss, and Ciri now appear in Sword of Convallaria as playable characters</a>; allowing players to enjoy collaborative stories and quests surrounding the Lord of the Forest from another world.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/sword-of-convallaria-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-collaboration-teaser-0-35-screenshot-1764947962246.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Geralt and Yennefer in the Sword of Convallaria x The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Official Collaboration Trailer</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bartosz Sztybor, Franchise Creative Director at CD PROJEKT RED, explained his take on the collaboration and how it came together:</strong> “At CD PROJEKT RED, storytelling is at the heart of everything we do, and we take a hands-on approach even when collaborating with external partners. For our partnership with Sword of Convallaria, our Franchise Creative team worked closely with developer XD International to craft a story that captures the essence of The Witcher universe, both for the anime trailer and the collaboration quest. Working with a partner who shares our passion for The Witcher is always a privilege, and we’re thrilled with the results of what we’ve created together. We’re looking forward to sharing the fruits of this partnership with the community, and can’t wait to see their response!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>CD PROJEKT RED’s Satoru Homma, Japan Country Manager, offered further insight into their partnership with XD Games:</strong> “For the collaboration between Sword of Convallaria and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, I was responsible for project management on behalf of CD PROJEKT RED. I am personally a huge fan of Sword of Convallaria, and I had a strong desire to see The Witcher 3’s characters — rendered in beautiful pixel art — playable within a tactical RPG. With the deep love and understanding Sword of Convallaria’s team holds for The Witcher 3, and under the thorough supervision of our in-house lore specialists, we were able to deliver grounded and authentic storytelling in the collaboration quest. I sincerely hope that The Witcher 3 players who may be unfamiliar with the tactical RPG genre will take the time to enjoy this content, which is infused with a deep appreciation for the world and its characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Director of Sword of Convallaria, Guo Lei (of XD Games)spoke about this collaboration in more detail — as well as the circumstances that led to it becoming a reality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Inspired by <em>Tactics Ogre</em>, which he played in high school, Guo always wanted to become a game creator. He is also a fan of <em>The Witcher 3</em>, and his favourite characters are Geralt and Yennefer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guo on Sword of Convallaria passing the first anniversary of its western release and how he feels looking back on the past year:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sword of Convallaria got off to a successful start, but there was a period when we were searching for the right direction to go in. However, thanks to the support of our fans, we were able to turn things around and successfully celebrate our first anniversary. From now on, we will continue to develop the game with confidence and enjoyment for the fans who have high expectations for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regarding the game's content, the Global version saw the release of Iria, and the story of her stepping into the world that lies beyond was depicted on the first anniversary. In the future, Sword of Convallaria will enter its 2.0 story arc, taking players on adventures beyond Iria, and develop a story in which the player protects peace. We hope you will look forward to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>— On how the  The Witcher 3 collaboration came about:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guo:</strong> From the beginning, our team had already been acquainted with the CDPR China team. During one of these casual conversations, we mentioned that it would be exciting if we could one day work on something together based on Sword of Convallaria and The Witcher 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later, we had the opportunity to meet the CDPR Japan team in person at Tokyo Game Show 2024. During our discussions there, I showed them my personal love for The Witcher 3 and the interest in exploring whether we might create something together. They encouraged us to submit a formal proposal, which set the collaboration into motion. The Witcher 3 is a game that boasts worldwide popularity, so I was over the moon when he positively considered our proposal for a collaboration. After considerable effort, the collaboration was officially approved. From that point onward, both teams dedicated nearly a full year to development, ultimately bringing this collaboration to life in the form you see today.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/sword-of-convallaria-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-collaboration-teaser-1-12-screenshot-1764948504837.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Play as Geralt, Yennefer, Triss, and Ciri in Sword of Convallaria</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What it was about </strong><em><strong>The Witcher 3</strong></em><strong> that particularly appealed to him:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">First of all, it's the sense of immersion that comes with being so realistic. You get the feeling that you're immersed in the world, something you can't experience in other games. Also, it's the story element. What's great about it is that it depicts so many stories that you can empathise with. It's very unique in that you make painful choices that change the outcome of the story. I was overwhelmed by how the fascinating characters play an active role in the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How the story was designed, its core themes, and the creative collaboration behind it</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We wanted to create the worldview of <em>The Witcher 3</em> within the world of <em>Sword of Convallaria</em>. However, it goes against Geralt's beliefs to get involved in conflicts between nations, and in fact, if we were to depict an epic story involving <em>The Witcher 3</em>, we felt that it would be quite a high hurdle to figure out how to resolve it. For this reason, we decided to aim for a down-to-earth story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story revolves around the Leshen from <em>The Witcher 3</em> appearing and causing trouble, and Geralt and his friends teaming up with the Leader to defeat it. Behind the scenes, the story also depicts the malice of people. For example, when a problem occurs, people assume that it is the work of those from a different background to themselves and blame them. The theme of the story poses a question of morality, as Geralt and Yennefer intervene to try to resolve this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In The Witcher 3, Geralt and Yennefer are portrayed as unusual people who present differently from the average person. Naturally, they have differing personalities and ways of conducting themselves. We made it a priority to carefully express the various facets of these characters in the collaborative story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We made sure to communicate closely with CD PROJEKT RED. We created shared documents, edited those documents, and received feedback, all of which allowed us to proceed with development meticulously and efficiently. This resulted in a fun development experience unlike any other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How they approached reimagining The Witcher 3 characters into the pixel-based world of Sword of Convallaria:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Witcher 3 has a realistic 3D visual style, but when translating that into pixel art, our first priority was to think about how to express the movement in a way that would satisfy players.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the designers also love The Witcher 3, so they had fun designing it  with care, for example, to make it clear the difference between a silver sword and a steel sword. As a result, I got the impression that the visuals went smoothly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The regions that were  main target for the collaboration:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Worldwide. Sword of Convallaria is available in four languages: Chinese, Japanese, English, and Korean. As with The Witcher 3, we have a global perspective and want game fans around the world to enjoy Sword of Convallaria Sword IP. Therefore, every region is important to us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If I had to say, we're particularly interested in English-speaking countries. We see the English-speaking world as a region where we still want to gain more fans for Sword of Convallaria. It goes without saying that The Witcher 3 has already gained many English-speaking fans, so we hope that this collaboration will help us further appeal to the English-speaking world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Aspects that particularly stood out for him during this collaboration:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this was a true collaboration. The fact that both parties were working together in the same direction was a feeling I'd never had before, and it was a lot of fun. It was a wonderful experience for us. So, this time, we were able to communicate directly with CDPR, and not only was it very efficient, but we also felt that everyone gained something from this project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The part of the collaboration that symbolised its success, or made him especially proud to be a part of it:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s necessary when collaborating with other artists is love for the work. I think that only when we have a strong love for the work can we create something that satisfies our collaborators. We ourselves had always wanted to collaborate with The Witcher 3, but it was thanks to CDPR that we were able to make it happen. We are truly happy. We have also prepared skins for Geralt, Yennefer, and Triss. We have created skins based on the scenes that moved us the most while we were playing The Witcher 3. Geralt usually wears armor, but for this skin we created one that realistically expresses the love between father and daughter when Ciri visits Geralt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Triss, in The Witcher 3, Triss and Geralt attend a dance party. However, the two of them aren't very interested in the dance party, so they sneak out midway through and enjoy a date in the garden. We recreated that atmosphere with the skin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each skin was created with love, so I hope all players will check them out.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/sword-of-convallaria-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-collaboration-teaser-1-26-screenshot-1764948378963.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yennefer stands in front of a portal in the Sword of Convallaria x The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Official Collaboration Trailer</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"> 
<strong>His message to the Sword of Convallaria players who are looking forward to the collaboration:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all of our fans. It is thanks to you all that Sword of Convallaria has grown so much over the past year or so, and that we have been able to safely reach our first anniversary. Thank you so much! Thanks to everyone's support, we were able to collaborate with The Witcher 3. How will Geralt and his friends play a role in the world of Sword of Convallaria? We hope that not only the Leaders but also fans of The Witcher 3 will enjoy the event.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/developer-of-new-postal-game-shuts-down-studio-after-game-was-announced-then-canceled-over-gen-ai-allegations</link>
            <guid>1374691</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio behind the Postal franchise just announced that it will be publishing a brand new Postal game, to be developed by Goonswarm Games. Unfortunately, it even more recently announced it would be cancelling said game, due to accusations that Goonswarm had used generative AI in its development. And now, Goonswarm is shutting down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game, entitled Postal: Bullet Paradise, was announced earlier this week on Wednesday with a reveal trailer and press release. It purports to be a "timeline-hopping, dystopian bullet heavne first-person shooter" set in the Postal universe, where players can select from 11 unlockable Postal Dudes from different timelines and, well, shoot people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, not long after the trailer debuted, Postal fans began pointing out that the game had a lot of hallmarks of assets made with generative AI. When we went to embed the trailer into this article for you to watch, our access to the video file had been cut off and the official version had been removed from YouTube. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4162690/POSTAL_Bullet_Paradise/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still watch it through the Steam page here</a> and judge for yourself.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/unnamed-1764952300064.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Checking in on the Postal subreddit, you can see some of the feedback. Fan spoint out that the pixel sprites' mouths "don't make sense", and elements such as shading and pixel placement are off somehow. They also point out that Goonswarm has almost certainly used generative AI in its games before (a close watch of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3642560/SCP_Control_Error/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this trailer</a> has a number of pretty obvious indicators), making it not impossible that it would do so again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When accusations initially began flying, both Goonswarm and Running With Scissors denied the use of generative AI. As Goonswarm <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/postal-bullet-paradise/canceled-ai-use" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told PCGamesN in a statement</a>:</p><blockquote>No generative AI was used for the reveal trailer or for the game. All assets were created by our human artists using standard tools. We've already shared layered PSDs, work-in-progress files, and other materials to confirm this. Any mistakes or rough spots in those files are being misinterpreted as 'proof' of AI, but they simply reflect the normal, human art-creation process</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, while Running With Scissors <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/postal/comments/1pdxamc/important_update_to_the_whole_ai_situation/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">initially promised to investigate further</a>, studio co-owner Mike Jeret <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/postal/comments/1peg2v8/wow_mike_j_great_customer_service_skills_go_to/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">angered the Postal audience further</a> by not just vehemently denying there was generative AI in the game, but also using fairly strong language toward the accusers, referring to them as "ignorant assholes" and telling anyone who thought the game used generative AI to "excuse yourself from our Discord."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But finally, today, the publisher has taken a definitive stance. Running With Scissors announced it would be canceling the game entirely, saying that the audience feedback had caused "extreme damage to our brand and our company reputation" and that it no longer trusted the development team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's Running With Scissors' statement in full:</p><blockquote>After revealing Postal: Bullet Paradise, a title Running With Scissors was planning on publishing but not developing, we've been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned Postal Community. The strong feedback from them is that elements of the game are very likely AI-generated and thus has caused extreme damage to our brand and our company reputation.</blockquote><blockquote>We’ve always been, and will always be, transparent with our community. Our trust in the development team is broken; therefore, we've killed the project. We have a lot of good things coming (some you know and some you don’t).</blockquote><blockquote>Since forming Running With Scissors in 1996, we’ve always said that our fans are part of the team. Our priority is to always do right by the millions who support the Postal franchise. We are grateful for the opportunity to make the games we want to play, and will continue to focus on our new projects and updates coming in 2026 and beyond. We can’t wait to share more!</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Fan feedback in response to this seems generally positive, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/postal/comments/1peewit/postal_bullet_paradise_cancelled/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a number of people suggesting</a> they were excited about the premise of the game and hoped it could be passed on to a different developer. Some are still hoping for an apology from Jeret for his language toward the community, but that has not yet manifested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there's one group of folks who aren't happy, and that's Goonswarm. In a statement posted to Twitter, the studio announced it would be <a href="https://x.com/goonswarmgames/status/1996984553257279918?s=46" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shutting down due to the cancellation of its game</a>. Here's their statement in full as well:</p><blockquote>Our project, and everything we built over the psat six years, was canceled in just a few days.</blockquote><blockquote>Our studio was mistakenly accused of using AI-generated art in our games, and every attempt to clarify our work only escalated the situation. In the last few hours, we've received a large number of threats, insults, and mockery, which pushed us toward a very difficult decision.</blockquote><blockquote>We're truly sorry for the artists who put their soul into this and supported our studio, only to face false AI accusations. It's tough to pour so much energy into a game and end up caught in the middle of an AI war by accident.</blockquote><blockquote>We've decided to shut down the studio and end all future activities.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you for being with us. Stay strong, play games.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">This is far from the first time the Postal games, which are essentially about various guys committing mass shootings, have been embroiled in controversy. The last mainline game, Postal 4: NoRegerts, released in 2022 to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/postal-4-no-regerts-review">a rare 2/10 from us</a>. Our reviewer said that "the comedy is lazy and embarrassing, the combat is messy and painfully unsatisfying, and it runs so poorly on high-end hardware that it can scarcely be enjoyed at all even by those just hoping for some campy shock humor." Running With Scissors has also released multiple spinoffs in recent years, such as 2022's Postal: Brain Damaged by CreativeForge Games and a 2023 April Fool's joke in POOSTALL Royale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>1374565</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA fans finally have their first look at Grand Theft Auto 5 character Michael in the Grand Theft Auto universe since the game launched back in 2013.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We can see Michael in the trailer for GTA Online DLC A Safehouse in the Hills, below. In the teaser for the upcoming expansion, which adds a luxurious new home for the most successful of online criminals to the online mode, a noticeably older, greying, Michael De Santa and his wife Amanda can be seen greeting a player at the front door of their fancy new Hollywood Hills crib. This is the first time that Michael, played by Ned Luke, has been seen in the Grand Theft Auto universe since GTA 5 launched back in 2013.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The update also settles any lingering questions around the canon ending for GTA 5, confirming once and for all that Option C, otherwise known as “Deathwish”, is how the story <em>should </em>end. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It now means that all three playable protagonists, with Franklin and Trevor being the other two, have appeared in GTA Online. Naturally, this means the “Deathwish” ending is now canon in Online’s version of Los Santos, as this is the only way that all three characters remain alive at the end of GTA 5’s final mission “The Third Way” — one of three possible last levels available depending on the player’s choice. For reference, “Something Sensible” is Option A, which leaves both Franklin and Michael alive, but kills Trevor, and “The Time’s Come” is Option B, resulting in Franklin and Trevor’s survival, but Michael’s death.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In all three possible endings, Franklin lives to walk the streets of Los Santos, so it always felt natural that he’d be a part of GTA Online, which takes place after the events of Grand Theft Auto 5. Trevor has also been present since 2013, giving the online protagonist missions and calling to berate them over the phone in his own peculiar manner, but this is the first time we’ve seen Michael’s face since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eagle-eared online players would’ve heard a small reference to the professional bank robber back in 2021, though, which, although it definitely alludes to Michael, didn’t 100% confirm he was still around. This occurs when Franklin is chasing two golfers through the Richards Majestic Studios film lot in the centre of the city. This is one of the places Michael works in order to achieve his Hollywood movie-producing dreams in the main game’s campaign. Franklin remarks, “I know one of the producers around here. I hope his ass ain’t work today…”, suggesting De Santa is still employed there after all this time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Celebrity in GTA 5 and GTA Online</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It is curious that Rockstar has chosen to put Michael back into the world of GTA so many years after we saw him last, and it does beg the question of how long this was planned for, seeing as this update has dropped so close to GTA 6’s previous release date of November 19, 2025. Is this the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption developer saying their final goodbye to these characters before gearing up to unleash Lucia and Jason into the world in 2026?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How do you feel about the “Deathwish” ending being chosen by Rockstar as the canonical one for GTA 5? Let us know in the comments below. And, of course, for everything GTA 6, stick with IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

Last month, Obsidian developers said they were well aware that whenever the studio announces a new game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/obsidian-knows-whenever-it-announces-a-new-game-everyone-asks-about-fallout-new-vegas-2-but-it-loves-making-original-ip-and-sequels-to-them">people ask where Fallout: New Vegas 2 is</a>, but they also love how they’ve been able to create new IP and even release sequels to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout Season 2 is set to hit Prime Video this December, and while Bethesda has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle-announced-on-fallout-day-here-are-the-contents"><u>a new Fallout: New Vegas bundle</u></a> up its sleeve, there’s no word yet on a Fallout remaster or a Fallout: New Vegas 2 to capitalize on the surge of interest in the franchise. Obsidian is of course the developer of the much-loved 2010 RPG Fallout: New Vegas, so fans often wonder whether it will return to the setting for a sequel, especially given it’s now owned by Bethesda parent company Microsoft.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian, though, has focused on making brand new games, and it is prolific in doing so. It’s released Grounded (Grounded 2 came out this year), fantasy RPG Avowed (which came out this year), and sci-fi RPG The Outer Worlds (The Outer Worlds 2 came out this year). Pentiment, which came out last year, was another brand new game, although I wouldn’t expect a sequel to that any time soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-3-remaster"><u>Fallout 3 remaster</u></a> that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>leaked back in 2023</u></a> was said to be still in the works.
