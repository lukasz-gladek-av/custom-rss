This particular sale is a “Buy 1, Get 1 50% Off” sale that applies to a massive selection of games. Sweetening the pot, many of the games that qualify are already on sale on their own. If you buy two already-discounted board games and save an extra 50% off one, that’s called “deal stacking,” and it’s a pro move.
