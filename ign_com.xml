However, voice actors may choose not to sign new contracts in solidarity with striking union members, or in the absence of a SAG Interim Agreement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Emeri Chase — who portrays Soldier 11 — said they were "replaced as Soldier 11 because I am unwilling to perform work not covered by a SAG Interim Agreement during a strike for AI protection, the outcome of which will determine the future of our industry." Nicholas Thurkettle, who played Lycaon, has been similarly replaced, although Thurkettle is not a union member.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'd like to clarify that there's a difference between being 'struck' and not being on an Interim Agreement," Chase explained in a thread on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:eun6fzj2cssacea3u2ukfewb/post/3lk5orkz76s2y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bluesky</u></a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-zenless-zone-zero-actors-lose-jobs-over-ai-dispute-without-notice-finding-out-alongside-players" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Eurogamer</u></a>). "Union projects that began work prior to the strike and non-union projects are not 'struck.' But they also do not offer the Union-enforced AI rights we are fighting for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Many actors are choosing to voluntarily withhold work on these categories of projects because we feel it is the best way to support the union's fight for the protections that are critical to our continued ability to create the art we love."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chase added that they knew "that by withholding work it was possible" they'd be replaced, but had "hoped [developer HoYoVerse] would choose to leave her silent until I was able to return."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I found out the role was recast today alongside all of you," Chase said, while Thurkettle stated: "I'm learning about this as you are, and I share your shock. Neither HoYoverse nor Sound Cadence has communicated with me since October. I've been fully available and recorded multiple voice jobs in that time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm not SAG but what game companies want to do with AI is an existential threat. I took a personal stand to ask for protection, and had to be willing to give up the best thing that's ever happened in my professional life. I stand by my choice."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked HoYoVerse for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a similar case from December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-character-recast-after-players-expressed-concern-about-new-voices">Activision confirmed it had recast some members of the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 cast</a> after fans noticed much-loved Zombies characters with new voices in-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company issued a statement to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/black-ops-6-zombies-characters-recast-after-original-actors-withdrew-during-strike" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Developer</a> admitting characters in Black Ops 6’s Zombies mode were recast amid the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zombies characters William Peck (Zeke Alton) and Samantha Maxis (Julie Nathanson) are currently voiced by new, unknown actors. Alton told Game Developer that he took no issue with Activision’s actions with Peck, but expressed concern “for my brand as a performer.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fans of the game have reached out to me because the lack of crediting [of the replacement actor] implies that it may still be me which unfairly represents my abilities as a performer," Alton said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on how the strike has, and will continue to, affect the games you play, check out our feature from last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-sag-aftra-video-game-actors-strike-means-for-gamers"><u>What the SAG-AFTRA Video Game Actors Strike Means for Gamers</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-improvements-and-features-revealed-by-the-battlefield-6-gameplay-leaks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/untitled-battlefield-game">Battlefield</a>'s playtest is giving us plenty of sneaky peeks at what's to come in EA's shooter, and developer DICE has "loads of feedback from the very active testers selected." Unlike <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-ea-admits-failure"><u>Battlefield 2042's lukewarm reception</u></a>, fans seem <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-fans-are-digging-the-leaks-and-ea-hasnt-taken-them-down-yet"><u>pretty pleased with what they've seen so far</u></a>, and the leaks have been so impressive, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-fans-are-digging-the-leaks-and-ea-hasnt-taken-them-down-yet"><u>EA's not even trying to take them down yet</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Battlefield team has <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1899415906104512741" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teased</u></a> there's still more tests to come to give more players a chance to get involved, we've pulled together all the improvements and new features we've spotted so far.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield 6 has a drag mechanic</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most notable is the ability to drag wounded allies away to safety. At the time of writing, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j6fw6j/what_do_you_think_of_the_mechanics_of_dragging_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>video clip on the Battlefield subreddit</u></a> showing off the new feature has had almost 8,000 upvotes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1899346999545086390" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>post on X</u></a>, Battlefield lead producer, David Sirland, confirmed he was "not okay with leaks," hinting that "[leakers] are [being] dealt with accordingly." Despite this, however, Sirland acknowledged that the new drag and revive feature is a key part of the "revive loop," adding: "I am expecting to see some interesting use in the next test on labs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With this feature, there's more of that fun interaction with more pieces to the puzzle," he <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1899203918351196567" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teased</u></a>. "There's some really fun combinations that can happen (it's cancellable at any time with hold version). I can't wait for you guys to start finding out what they are."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield 6 lets you cling on to vehicles</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It also looks as though <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j7y8n9/new_mechanic_clinging_to_vehicles/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>players can cling to vehicles</u></a>, too, either to get around the map quicker or lie in wait for a perfect sneaky ambush. While some players still aren't sure if the images are merely enter/exit animations, this feature was rumored some time ago, and it appears the playtest now confirms it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield 6 has improved in-game movement</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also been a lot of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1j6441p/battlefield_labs_community_update_gunplay_and/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>positive chatter about in-game movement</u></a>, too, with improved and/or reintroduced movement features such as crouch sprint, combat dive, and landing roll, as well as new visual indicators "to make it easier to understand when movements such as vaulting or leaning are possible."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield 6 reportedly has 3D maps</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">3D maps are back as well. According to sources who've played the pre-alpha playtest, it looks as though both the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j8agdd/3d_maps_are_back_in_bf6_explanation/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>mini-map and the spawn screen maps are 3D</u></a>. This makes it easier to see the elevation of tall buildings and landscapes, helping you choose the perfect spawn point. The last time we saw 3D maps in Battlefield was in 2018's Battlefield 5.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield 6 has improved destruction</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Environmental destruction — a key part of Battlefield's appeal that can be used to give players a tactical advantage — is similarly beefed up, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j7uk4q/a_full_view_of_the_destructibility_from_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>as this brief clip</u></a>, with over 9000 upvotes and 600 comments, shows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what's next? Lead producer Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1899415906104512741" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>revealed</u></a> DICE now has "loads of feedback from the very active testers selected [...] in good amounts and in the right areas for us to be able to use it." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There is a rationale to the approach we are taking, and it's working well so far. There will be more tests and we'll open up to more over time," he added. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Have we missed your favorite feature or mechanic? Let us know in the comments below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has been playing its cards pretty close to its chest about the new Battlefield, and we still don't know when, exactly, it will launch. But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-expected-fiscal-year-2026"><u>EA's last financial report</u></a> suggested it'll come sometime between April 2025 and March 2026. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.
