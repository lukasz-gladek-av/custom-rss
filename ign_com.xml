            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-players-share-love-and-fear-for-its-new-flagship-monster-arkveld<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">You've been thunderstruck.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Monster Hunter Wilds beta is back, and it's got a few new fights in tow. Beta players are already grappling with its big challenge, a fearsome new foe called Arkveld, and its eliciting both excitement and dread.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arkveld is the new flagship monster for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. This means the beast is the cover star for the game, and stands to play a significant role in the course of players' journeys through Wilds. As part of the new beta test, courageous hunters can try to tackle a hunt for the Chained Arkveld, with a 20-minute time limit and five "faint" limit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As ambitious players are discovering, this new monster packs a punch. Arkveld is a massive winged beast, with electric chains stretching out from each of its arms. It can swing them around and make the air crackle with its thunderous attacks, and it's surprisingly fast, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Experienced hunters <a href="https://x.com/KeithMontalbo/status/1887717556322279689" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>are still finding themselves sent back in a cart</u></a> by its powerful moves. It's an impressive display of the new technology, as Arkveld uses its whips to move around, throw out long-reaching attacks, and generally be a menace. One attack in particular has Monster Hunter players in the beta thunderstruck, as it grabs the hunter and roars at them before slamming them down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arkveld is even causing some mild unexpected havoc. I really <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1ijrpqw/arkveld_is_having_none_of_that/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>enjoyed this video one player on the r/MHWilds subreddit captured</u></a>, of Arkveld interrupting their meal. The wilds are no place to go for lunch, it seems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a visually impressive fight and an incredibly dangerous monster. While the difficulty might be worrisome for some, the Monster Hunter faithful seem spurred on by it. Taking down big, dangerous monsters is the name of the game after all, and seeing Wilds' flagship monster be so fearsome and iconic in equal measure is a reaffirming notion. Additionally, the "Chained" note — plus Arkveld's flagship status — has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1ijmvau/comment/mbfj5yn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some players considering</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1ijmvau/comment/mbfh1n4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whether there could be</a> an even more terrifying "Unchained" version down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/obt/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test 2</u></a> runs February 6 through 9, and then returns February 13 through 16. Both Arkveld and returning monster Gypceros are available to hunt, and there are some other added features, like a Training Area and Private Lobbies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds will be out on February 28, 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-takes-a-jab-at-final-fantasy-14-with-its-housing-plans<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Player housing is coming to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/world-of-warcraft-midnight"><u>World of Warcraft</u></a>, and Blizzard has unveiled its first look at how the MMO will handle it. In a new preview, the WoW team walked through early details, and even threw a quick jab at Final Fantasy XIV's housing in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-next-expansion-finally-adding-player-housing-after-years-of-requests-by-fans"><u>adding a sought-after housing feature</u></a> in its upcoming expansion, World of Warcraft: Midnight. Amid its pillars and goals for housing in <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24176592/building-in-azeroth-a-first-look-at-housing" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the recent dev blog</u></a>, Blizzard listed "A Home for Everyone" as one of its targets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As a part of our focus on wide adoption, we wanted to ensure that Housing is available to everyone. If you want a house, you can have a house," Blizzard said. "No exorbitant requirements or high purchase costs, no lotteries, and no onerous upkeep (and if your subscription lapses, don’t worry, your house doesn’t get repossessed!)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Player housing is, in essence, what it sounds like: physical homes players can buy in these MMO worlds, with plenty of room for personalization and decoration, that other players can visit. It's a very popular facet of Final Fantasy XIV where housing feeds player ingenuity, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-housing"><u>resulting in theater productions, nightclubs, cafes, and museums</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Final Fantasy XIV also has some rather infamous housing woes. There are a limited number of plots per server, you have to pay high amounts of Gil and enter a lottery, and then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-pauses-housing-demolition-in-the-wake-of-hurrican-helene"><u>risk your house being demolished</u></a> if left alone too long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft's aim seems to be countering some concerns players might have about housing, based on Final Fantasy XIV's situation. Housing is even shared among the Warband, so characters can come and go, and rewards are also shared across characters and factional lines. While a Human character can't buy a house in the Horde zone, a Troll character in your Warband can, and then the Human character can use it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, while World of Warcraft's housing will be split into just two housing zones and "Neighborhoods" of roughly 50 plots apiece, they are instanced and have both Public and Private options. The former is maintained by game servers and created "as needed," so there's no clear limit yet on Neighborhoods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard seems to be in it for the long haul with World of Warcraft housing. In its stated pillars, alongside "boundless self-expression" and "deeply social," the team said it wants housing to be a "long lasting journey" with its own roadmap, and updates stretching out into future patches and expansions. It certainly feels like a commitment, and though it took a jab at XIV's systems, it also shows Blizzard is aware of the pitfalls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are still more details to iron out between now and the expected summer unveiling of World of Warcraft: Midnight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
