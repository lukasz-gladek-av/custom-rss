No markdowns, but honestly, just finding these in stock without a 50% markup is a win.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon US: Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Iron Valiant)</h2><div catalogid="311bd43a-0408-4d85-a904-50c6012d8dda" id="216917"><div id="216917" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Iron Valiant)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Paradox Rift has been a bit of a rollercoaster for players and collectors. It doesn’t have the usual Pikachu/Charizard hype machine, but what it <em>does</em> have are some of the most meta-relevant cards in recent sets and artwork that absolutely slaps. The pull rates? Not great. The chase cards? Expensive. The FOMO when Roaring Moon ex keeps dodging your packs? Very real.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon US: Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Roaring Moon)</h2></div><div catalogid="311bd43a-0408-4d85-a904-50c6012d8dda" id="216918"><div id="216918" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Roaring Moon)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Iron Valiant ETB comes with a full-art Iron Bundle promo and futuristic-themed sleeves, because nothing says "Pokémon" like a robot Delibird. If you’re a fan of the sci-fi aesthetic, this box is a great pickup. Just don’t expect Iron Bundle to replace anything in your deck unless you enjoy disappointment.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon UK: Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Iron Valiant)</h2></div><div catalogid="738405dd-7e39-45c3-8b6a-3ed6806236d5" id="216919"><div id="216919" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Iron Valiant)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Roaring Moon ETB is the headliner here. You get a Scream Tail promo, Roaring Moon-themed sleeves, and the best shot at pulling a Roaring Moon ex, assuming the universe doesn’t hate you. The Roaring Moon ETB has been the hardest to find at retail price, which is why I'm hyped to find this ETB in stock. If you want it, grab it before the resellers do.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon UK: Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Roaring Moon)</h2></div><div catalogid="738405dd-7e39-45c3-8b6a-3ed6806236d5" id="216920"><div id="216920" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Roaring Moon))</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Roaring Moon ex (Special Illustration Rare) is <em>the</em> card of the set, currently sitting at around $60 on the resale market. It’s one of the strongest attackers in the game right now, and the artwork is top-tier. If you pull this, congratulations!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Groudon (Illustration Rare) is another savage looking card, hovering around $100. This is one of those cards that just <em>looks</em> valuable. The lava and ominous sky everything a Groudon fan could ask for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Iron Valiant ex (Special Illustration Rare) is one of the more expensive Future Pokémon cards, going for $35. The neon, synthwave-style artwork is so cool, and its ability makes it a powerhouse in competitive play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

Developer Arrowhead also increased the number of AI calculations the game can perform, which primarily impacts scenarios with a high number of spawned enemies, improving their response times in those situations. However, this comes with a slight trade-off in game performance, Arrowhead said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of these gameplay changes is that the Automatons specifically will present a tougher challenge as they now have increased reaction speed in large groups. Expect Helldivers 2's already imposing bots to act smarter and make decisions faster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s a useful improvement: the stratagem loadout menu has undergone an updated categorization of the different stratagem groupings.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment announced Helldivers 2’s next Warbond, called Borderline Justice. The theme this time is 'space cowboy,' and in keeping with that theme there are new weapons including the R-6 Deadeye lever-action hunting rifle, the LAS-58 Talon "revolver" secondary, and the TED-63 Dynamite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The GS-17 Frontier Marshal is space cowboy-themed medium Helldiver set, as is the GS-66 Lawmaker heavy armor, which comes complete with cowboy holster and bandolier. The Gunslinger armor passive gives your secondary increased reload speed, increased draw/holster speed, and reduced recoil. The warbond launches March 20.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/hd2-1742294703651.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Helldivers 2's next warbond adds a space cowboy theme. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2’s ongoing Galactic War is currently focusing on the Illuminate alien faction, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-players-are-looking-for-hidden-messages-amid-black-hole-disaster">which is slowly pushing a black hole towards Super Earth</a>.
