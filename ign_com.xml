            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Happy new year, or almost new year, or just… whatever time it is when you’re reading this. For me, it’s the very tail end of 2025, and what better time to take a look ahead at some of the games coming out in the new year? Here are 2026’s biggest game releases</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get into it, just a heads up that this is by no means a 100% comprehensive guide to all the games coming out in 2026, as many of those haven’t even been announced yet. Also, as always, release dates are subject to change - I made something very much like this exactly a year ago in which I told you that GTA would be the biggest game of 2025… assuming it came out in 2025, which it didn’t. So, this is true in our regular monthly game release updates, but it’s especially true when we’re talking about games that are 11 months away, or games that don’t have release dates yet.</p><p id="january"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="January">January</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On January 15, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> gets a new lease on life, and also a new mortgage to pay off when the beloved debt, yard work, and interior decoration sim comes to Switch 2 - and if you happen to be one of the 50 million people who bought Animal Crossing on the original Switch, you’ll be happy to hear that you can upgrade to the Switch 2 version for just 5 bucks. Meanwhile, if you’re still playing on Switch 1, you’ll still be getting access to a ton of new features with the 3.0 update, which adds a ton of new features including hotel renovation, and in-game items based on other Nintendo properties, as well as LEGO’s line of Animal Crossing sets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can’t spell “Purchase a Game In January” without JRPG, or a lot of other letters, but this is the time of year when fans of that particular genre are bound to be especially busy. Still on the 15th, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond The Horizon</a>, which is the seventeenth installment in The Legend of Heroes series, or the thirteenth installment in the Trails series, and a direct sequel to 2022’s Legend of Heroes Trails Through Daybreak II. That’s coming to all the Switches, PlayStations, and PC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/highguard-1765988376157.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Highguard is the new PvP game from ex-Titanfall and Apex Legends devs, landing January 26.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the 22nd, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</a> comes to Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series as well as Xbox on PC - this includes the base game, all the visual and technical improvements that it got when it was ported to PS5, a whole side story that follows Yuffie, and this latest release will add a new streamlined mode that maxes out your party’s stats and has all attacks do 9,999 damage so you can just blow through the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not quite a JRPG, but JRPG-adjacent, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors Origins</a> also hits Switch 2 that day, alongside the Visions of Four Heroes DLC expansion, which also comes to the other platforms the game’s already on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the 26th, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> drops, which is the new PVP raid game from a bunch of ex-Respawn devs who worked on Titanfall and Apex Legends - and while you can see some similar DNA, it’s clearly going a very different direction, and instead of bunch of a bunch of wallrunning dudes and Neil Blomkamp mechs, it’s got more fantasy flair - so if you’ve ever wanted to bear arms while riding a bear, go nuts. That’s free to play on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, rounding out January’s JRPGs, on the 28th there's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-seven-deadly-sins-origin">The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin,</a> an open-world RPG based on the hit anime series for PS5, PC, and mobile. And then on the 30th, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/code-vein-ii">Code Vein 2</a>, the sequel to Bandai Namco’s 2019 vampire anime soulslike, which is on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At some point in January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/2xko">2XKO</a> will hit PS5 and Xbox series, which is Riot Games’ 2v2 fighting game featuring a roster of characters from League of Legends - that’s been in early access on PC since October.</p><p id="february"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="February">February</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On February 5, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</a> hits PS5, Xbox Series, both Switches, and PC. Originally released stateside for PS1 in 2001, and then 3DS 15 years after that, it’s now getting a full modern overhaul. JRPGs aren’t exactly known for being concise, but this one is pretty infamously beefy, and don’t be surprised if you sink 100 hours into this just doing the main quest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d rather just make a bunch of colorful characters hit each other, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/my-hero-academia-alls-justice">My Hero Academia: All’s Justice</a> is a 3v3 arena fighter featuring several dozen characters from the beloved anime series. That’s on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC February 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also on the 6th is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>, the third installment in Team Ninja’s tough-as-balls soulslike series that is actually its first true sequel, as Nioh 2 took place before the events of the first game - which probably has no bearing whatsoever on the moment to moment combat that’s the main selling point here. That’s on PS5 and PC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/nioh-3-1765988443560.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nioh 3 promises even more tough-as-balls soulslike action on February 6. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On February 11, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo is a Deadman</a> is the latest whackadoo action game from Suda51 and the fine folks at Grasshopper Manufacture, who gave us such cult classics as Killer7 and No More Heroes - this latest one looks to be as stylish, absurd, and over-the-top as we’ve come to expect. That’s on PS5, Xbox series and PC. I’ve had the pleasure of interviewing a lot of really interesting people in this job, and Suda is one of my favorites - we did one with him years ago where we asked a bunch of really stupid questions rapid-fire and he didn’t skip a beat. So anyway, I’m happy to see he’s keeping busy making weird cool games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the 12th, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> hits everything but Xbox One. Yakuza 3 was originally released for the PS3 back in 2009, and though it was included with the remastered collection in 2019, that version didn't get any major graphical or gameplay improvements. Kiwami 3, on the other hand, is a full modern overhaul, so this’ll play as great as it looks - and the Dark Ties expansion is a whole new side story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still that day on Switch 2 is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, which may sound like a fun casual sports game, but it’s also a very serious medical condition that can be deadly if not treated immediately. If you develop symptoms of Mario Tennis Fever while playing this game, please consult a Dr. Mario.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the 13th we’re getting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/high-on-life-2">High on Life 2</a>, the follow-up to the excellent 2022 first-person metroidvania - and between the first game, its High on Knife DLC, and now this, I gotta give the team at Squanch Games credit for shipping two and a half Metroid Prime-likes in half the time it took Retro to get Metroid Prime 4 out the door. Also, High on Life 2 is the only way you can legally purchase the classic 1991 Wisdom Tree platformer Bible Adventures for current consoles.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/residentthumb-1765504800570.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Everyone's favourite Leon is back for Resident Evil: Requiem, out February 27.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On February 20, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> is the latest Japanese action RPG rooted in Scandinavian folklore - and it’s actually an enhanced re-release of 2023’s Ys X: Nordics, but with enough added abilities, bosses and levels that it’s apparently very proud of itself. That’s coming to PS5, PC, and Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the 24th, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tides-of-tomorrow">Tides of Tomorrow</a> hits PS5, Xbox Series and PC, which is set in a vibrant post-apocalyptic ocean world that’s riddled with microplastics, and where the choices made by other players in their game will affect how the narrative in yours unfolds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On February 27, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> - or the ninth mainline entry, if you’re keeping count - hits Xbox Series, PS5, PC, and Switch 2. I’m fairly late to the Resident Evil party, but as someone who liked 7, loved 8, and adored the remakes, I’m fairly lukewarm on what I’ve seen of this one so fair - but I’m also willing to give it a shot, since that team has been knocking it out the park with this series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Any Switch 2 owners looking to play catchup, Resident Evil 7 and 8 - AKA Biohazard and Village - are also coming to the hybrid handheld that day as well. They got cloud-streamed versions on Switch 1, but this is the first time they’ll be playable locally on Nintendo hardware. </p><p id="march"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="March">March</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On March 5, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokemon Pokopia</a> comes to Switch 2, which sort of looks like Animal Crossing, except you play as a ditto who is masquerading as a human being, something that will never not be totally unsettling. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hitting PC, Xbox Series and PS5 on March 12, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/john-carpenters-toxic-commando">John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando</a> is a post-apocalyptic co-op FPS that’s been developed by the World War Z team with some input from the legendary horror filmmaker turned grouchy hardcore gamer, and it looks as though it’ll sit well with anyone wishing the Left 4 Dead franchise hadn’t been… abandoned in a seemingly deceased state. That’s on Xbox Series, PS5, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That same day on PC is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/solasta-ii">Solasta 2</a>, the follow-up to the very well-received 2021 tactical CRPG, which should click with anybody who’s had their fill of Baldur’s Gate 3 and needs to kill some time before Divinity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also on March 12, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fatal-frame-ii-crimson-butterfly-remake">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</a> hits all the newer consoles and PC, and that’s a modern do-over of the 2003 survival horror game that’s sort of like Pokémon Snap but with scary ghosts instead of cute animals.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/staglordthumb-1724252921663.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Massive open-world action game Crimson Desert saddles up for action on March 19.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d prefer a game about making friends scary animals, on the 13th, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> for those same platforms, which puts a more conventional turn-based JRPG spin on Capcom’s hit creature clobberer series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re more into big huge sprawling open-world RPGs with fast-paced realtime combat, on the 19th there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a>, the single player spinoff of Black Desert Online. That’s on Xbox Series, PS5, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d rather just shoot olde tymie cartoon criminal critters, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mouse-pi-for-hire">Mouse: P.I. For Hire</a> looks to like a boomer shooter with Cuphead aesthetics - that’s on everything</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On March 26, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/screamer">Screamer</a> hits PS5, Xbox Series, and PS5 - I heard about this game a while ago, and was wondering what was taking so long since the gameplay looked like it was in a pretty good state. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/screamer-official-story-trailer-the-game-awards-2025">trailer that dropped during The Game Awards</a> answered the hell out of that question: in addition to being a racing game, this is also a cyberpunk anime, and it sure looks like those cutscenes took a while. So, if you’ve ever wished for a cross between Redline and Initial D with playable races, here you go!</p><p id="april"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="April">April</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On April 16, yet another game with literary inspirations is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cthulhu-the-cosmic-abyss">Cthulu: The Cosmic Abyss</a>, a first person thriller mired in the unthinkable cosmic horrors of the works of H.P. Lovecraft, so that should be a nice cheerful jaunt. That’s on Xbox Series, PS5, and PC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/sarosthumb-1765509236647.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Saros, the successor to Returnal, arrives on April 30.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On April 24 arrives <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, which is a totally new sci-fi property from Capcom that pairs third-person shooting with some realtime hacking minigames, which seems cool. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a similar note, on April 30, the folks who gave us Returnal are back with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/saros">Saros</a>, a roguelite third-person bullet hell, which stars the wonderful Rahul Kohli and takes place in a sci-fi setting that’s cribbing from Robert W. Chambers' proto-lovecraftian classic, The King in Yellow.</p><p id="may"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="May">May</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On May 8th, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/mortal-kombat-ii">Mortal Kombat 2</a> hits theaters, the first of two very fun-looking fighting game movies. Something I very much appreciated about the first game is they didn’t make use of the whole roster, and saved some big names for round two - namely, Johnny Cage, who looks to be very much the central focus of the sequel, and he’s being played by the ever-delightful Karl Urban. Very excited to watch him do a split and punch someone in the groin.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/screenshot-2025-12-11-at-8-18-32-pm-1765508198447.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Our Arkham dreams (sort of) come true with LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight on May 29.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On May 27, we’ll get high speed chases and every other kind of action in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>, a game I’m trying not to get too excited about, but which i can’t not - after all, it’s from the team behind Hitman: World of Assassinaiton, which is already basically the best James Bond game to date, except this one’s actually about Ian Fleming’s legendary spy. Anyway that’s coming to all the newer consoles and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> is the closest thing to an Arkham game we’ll be getting anytime soon, and while it might not have quite the massive roster of playable characters as TT Games’ previous LEGO titles, it looks to be making up for it with much tighter combat. That’s on all the newer boxes and also PC on May 29.</p><p id="september"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="September">September</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Illfonic, the studio that gave us asymmetrical multiplayer horror games based on Friday the 13th, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, and Predator are giving the granddaddy of all slashers the same treatment with John Carpenter’s original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halloween-2026">Halloween</a>, which’ll also have a single player mode this time around. That’s coming to Xbox Series, PS5 and PC on September 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On September 12, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phantom-blade-zero">Phantom Blade Zero</a> hits PC and PS5, which looks like a soulslike or a hack and slash action game, and while it is an action RPG with lots of hacking and slashing, it’s apparently doing its own thing that’s somewhere in the middle - whatever the hell it is, buzz on this one is killer.</p><p id="october"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="October">October</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not a game, but obviously worth including is the newest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/street-fighter-2026">Street Fighter</a> movie, which looks like an absolute blast and I’ve been hyping this movie up since the first casting announcements trickled out - it’s directed by Kitao Sakurai, who is best known for his work with Eric Andre on the Eric Andre Show and the film Bad Trip, which has involved a lot of people getting injured in entertaining ways in public places as well as a few cars getting destroyed, so I think this movie is going to kick ass. That hits theaters October 16 and I will be there opening night.</p><p id="november"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="November">November</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/02/gta6-thumb-1746223309078.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">GTA 6 finally, finally arrives on November 19.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And of course, the biggest game of 2026, the 2020s as a whole, and possibly all time, assuming it ever comes out, is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which is hitting Xbox Series and PS5 on November 19 - a date which basically every other game in development is steering clear of. At this point we’ve been waiting so long for this game that it’s just stopped seeming like something I’ll ever get to play - but someday, I’ll get to actually play it, I think, and I hope it’s this year!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, that takes us to the very end of games that currently have release dates - but there a whole lot more that just have vague 2026 releases planned, so here’s what we’ve got right now:</p><p id="sometime-in-2026"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sometime in 2026">Sometime in 2026</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlestar-galactica-scattered-hopes">Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</a> is expected sometime in the first quarter of 2026, which lets you strategically square off with Cylons on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At some point in 2026, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> is supposedly coming to PS5, and while Bethesda's dropped a handful of updates post-launch, I feel like players weren’t quite over the moon for this one - but who knows, maybe it’ll get some more tweaks and content alongside its eventual PlayStation version.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-meat-boy-3d">Super Meat Boy 3D</a> adds a whole extra dimension to Team Meat’s beloved indie platformer, and that’s coming to PS5, Xbox Series, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/zero-parades-for-dead-spies">Zero Parades: For Dead Spies</a> is the latest offbeat and extremely cerebral CRPG from the developers of Disco Elysium. This is clearly a spiritual successor, but rather than take cues from detective fiction, Zero Parades is all about the world of espionage - specifically, the nerve-racking deception-based kind, not the sexy hollywood kind. That’s coming to PC and PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want a game that takes place inside books, but involves a lot less reading, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/chronoscript-the-endless-end">Chronoscript: The Endless End</a> is an exploration based action-adventure sidescroller - or maybe more accurately, page turner. That’s on PS5 and PC as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/thick-as-thieves">Thick as Thieves</a> is a PvPvE stealth game from Warren Spector, who was behind the original Deus Ex, and that’s sneaking onto PS5, Xbox Series, and PC at some point in 2026</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re sad we haven’t gotten a brand new Metal Gear Solid game in over a decade, you might want to keep an eye on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mudang-two-hearts">Mudang: Two Hearts</a>, which looks like like a similar blend of stealth, action, tactical military stuff, and over the top sci-fi nonsense, and that’s coming to PS5, Xbox Series, and PC as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like sequels, don’t worry, they’re still making lots of those: if you want to go on a power trip, you can be a tyrannical dictator in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tropico-7">Tropico 7</a>. If you’d rather feel utterly powerless, you can get punched so hard your soul flies out of your body in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-shell-ii">Mortal Shell 2</a>. Those are both on the big consoles and PC. On Switch 2 and PC, you can go dungeon-crawling through even more bullet hells in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/enter-the-gungeon-2">Enter the Gungeon 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/onimusha-way-of-the-sword">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> marks the long-awated return of Capcom’s PS2-era supernatural samurai series, and that’s coming to Xbox Series, PS5, and PC. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to travel through time and fight some ex boyfriends, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/scott-pilgrim-ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a>, the long-awaited follow-up to hit beat-em-up based on Bryan Lee O’Malley’s beloved Canadian manga, which is on basically everything. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-trailer-ps5-games-0001-1758750687975.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Wolverine should pop his claws before the end of the year. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Canadians, Marvel’s fan favorite canucklehead finally slices and dices his way onto PS5 sometime in the fall - Insomniac’s long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Wolverine</a> game is clearly not shying away from an M-rating, but hopefully it’s got as much brains and heart as it does blood and guts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two other Marvel games are also in the works expected in 2026 at some point: Skydance’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, which features Cap and Black Panther’s grandpa, who is also Black Panther, fighting in World War 2 on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC. And then there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls</a> on PS5 and PC, a fighting game from Arc System Works that looks like it could be a proper spiritual successor to Marvel Vs Capcom - just, without the Capcom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ace-combat-8-wings-of-theve">Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve</a> is the latest entry in the long running jet pilot sim to try to tempt me into playing it with sequences of stuff happening outside of a jet that are so impressively realistic it makes me forget that I don’t actually enjoy the part where you fly the jet. Don’t get me wrong, I think jets are the coolest thing ever invented and this game looks gorgeous, but aerial dogfighting in video games just never clicks for me. Can I just play the parts where you eat hamburgers and drink beer with your friends on an aircraft carrier? Anyway, that’s on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remedy’s David Lynchian interconnected universe gets a bit bigger with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control-resonant">Control: Resonant</a>, which is a continuation of IGN’s 2019 game of the year, but also connects with Alan Wake 2 and FBC Firebreak - and even if you’re not keeping track of what’s going on, this looks like it’ll still be a good time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve always wondered why nobody’s made any first-person soulslikes, and the trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/decrepit">Decrepit</a> answered that question very loudly: because they’d be too fucking scary. Get this shit outta here. Too scary! Just awful! No thank you! That’s on PC for now, so if you play on console, you’re safe from its horrors for the time being. Did you see that spider? Fuck off!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Less scary looking, but from a studio with some major horror chops is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ontos">Ontos</a>, which is from the folks behind Amnesia and SOMA and takes place in a hotel where a lot of weird stuff is happening, which is to be expected from a hotel that’s <em>on the moon</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want something nice and cute in space, there’s the two-player co-op adventure <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/orbitals">Oribitals</a> on Switch 2 which looks just gorgeous. Lots of games look like anime, but this one specifically looks like a bubble era OVA, which has not just a specific aesthetic, but a certain VHS graininess and poppy sound quality as well, and that’s such a pretentious delineation but as a reformed weeaboo whose formative years were filled with badly dubbed “Japanimation” from Manga Video, I applaud this attention to detail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another co-op adventure coming this year is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/out-of-words">Out of Words</a>, which is all stop-motion featuring handcrafted puppets. I have this theory that Geoff Keighley really loves puppets, and if you make a game with puppets in it, he’s more likely to feature it prominently in one of his shows - Out of Words was one of two puppet-centric games that debuted at Summer Game Fest, the other being <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/felt-that-boxing">Felt That: Boxing</a>, and it showed up again at The Game Awards in between Miss Piggy appearances. Anyway that’s coming to the new consoles and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-galactic-racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a> is hitting PS5, Xbox Series, and PC at some point in 2026, and I am <em>stoked</em> - like 10 years ago, when it was announced that EA had the Star Wars license, I was like, "Get the people who do Burnout and Need for Speed to do a podracing game." -And well, it took a minute, but we’re getting something even better: a studio founded by a bunch of ex-Criterion devs is making a game like that and EA has nothing to do with it! Also, this isn’t straight podcasting - it’s got a bunch of other speeders and stuff, which reminds me of the criminally underrated 2000 vehicular combat game Star Wars Demolition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you thought that was a stupid joke, well, bad news because <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/stupid-never-dies">Stupid Never Dies</a> - which is the name of a video game that’s coming out at some point on PC and PS5. This is a dungeon crawler action game that has some major Lollipop Chainsaw vibes, but it’s actually from a new studio founded by Hiroyuki Kobayashi, who, among other things, worked on Devil May Cry, Resident Evil, and Dragon’s Dogma.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tankrat">Tankrat</a> is a game where you drive a cool tank around and shoot stuff while also exploring and finding new stuff to make your tank even cooler - and it reminds me of modern version of Blaster Master. You guys remember Blaster Master? No? Well it sort of looked like this except really old. Tankrat is coming to PS5 and PC. </p><p id="to-be-announced"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="To Be Announced">To Be Announced</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">A whole lot of games just have a vague “TBA” release window, which means that they’ll probably come out someday. And while 2026 seems like a safe bet for most of these, some might even be further down the road, while others might never come out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you ever wished they’d do a Star Wars XCOM... well, they’re doing it! <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-zero-company">Zero Company</a>, or ZCOM for short, is from a studio of ex-Firaxis devs, and looks like a turn-based tactical good time. That’s coming to Xbox, PS5, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cinder-city">Cinder City</a> is an open-world MMO tactical shooter that looks like it has literally everything in it, and that’s coming to PC at some point - though looking at this game in action, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was a 2027 game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen-2">Lords of the Fallen 2</a> is the sequel to the 2023 soulslike, which was itself the reboot of a game already titled Lords of the Fallen, so this is technically the third Lords of the Fallen game, but who’s keeping track? That’s on the newer non-Nintendo consoles and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All we’ve seen of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/road-kings">Road Kings</a> is a cinematic trailer where a dude drives his 18 wheeler straight toward a tornado, but that seems like it was enough to get people hyped. And it’s from Saber, the studio that gave us Mudrunner and Snowrunner and the recent Road Craft, and as a very casual truck game enjoyer, I’m curious to see what their spin on a long-haul trucking sim is like. That’s on PC, Xbox Series, and PS5.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/29/dow-1759142668541.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Loads of Space Marines are going to be vaporised by Necrons in Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War 4.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4</a> is the first installment in the fan-fave RTS series in almost a decade, and while it’s not from Relic, the studio that made the first three games, it is from the team behind another well-received RTS, Iron Harvest. That’s coming to PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomodachi Life might not have quite the same name-brand recognition as Animal Crossing, but the original mii-centric social game released in 2014 was the 11th best-selling 3DS game of all time, so it’s a surprise it’s taken Nintendo this long to make another one. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> will be on Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Somebody put <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> on our list of upcoming game releases, and while that’ll probably come out someday, I would be shocked if it dropped in 2026. However, if you’re after a big pretty fantasy RPG from Xbox Game Studios, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fable">Fable</a> seems a lot more likely for a fall release. This one is from Playground Games, the studio that gave us Forza Horizon, so I’m stoked to see how they tackle wizard stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Forza Horizon, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/forza-horizon-6">the sixth entry</a> is expected sometime in 2026, and though there have been rumblings it might launch in the first half of the year, nothing official on that front aside from the fact that it’s set in Japan this time around. Fable and Forza Horizon are both hitting Xbox Series and PC, with PS5 versions probably arriving later on, if recent Xbox release strategy is anything to go on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War turns 20 in 2026, and to mark the occasion we’re hopefully getting a brand new installment with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day">E-Day</a>. This is a prequel set 14 years before the first game and will follow Marcus Fenix during the events of Emergence Day, when the big scary guys you’ve been shooting at and chainsawing into pieces in all the other installments first started coming out of holes in the ground. That’ll be on Xbox and PC for sure, and again, maybe PS5 at some point too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another major franchise celebrating a big anniversary is Tomb Raider, which turns 30 - To celebrate, we’re getting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis">Legacy of Atlantis</a>, a full ground-up Unreal Engine 5 remake of the original Tomb Raider. It certainly looks pretty, but I’m curious how much it plays like the originals. That’ll be on Xbox Series, PS5, and PC. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/tombatlantisthumb-1765507427086.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lara's finally back in action in 2026 with Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you ever wished for a distant prequel to the Plague Tale games that swapped the medieval European setting for an ancient Greek one, well… you’re in luck! Because that’s exactly what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resonance-a-plague-tale-legacy">Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy</a> is - and that’s coming to Xbox Series, PS5, and PC</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliott: The Millennium Tales</a> is the latest game from the folks behind Bravely Default and Octopath Traveller, and hopefully you won’t have to wait a thousand years to play - that one’s coming to all the newer consoles and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Usually it’s bad when a game freezes, but sometimes that’s a feature, not a bug - like the bleak frigid survival game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/blackfrost-the-long-dark-2">Blackfrost: The Long Dark 2</a>, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/frostrail">Frostrail</a>, a survival game that’s also bleak and frigid, but at least you have a train - those are both coming to PC - and there’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ikuma-the-frozen-compass">Ikuma: The Frozen Compass</a>, a coming of age story set in the arctic, which seems frigid, but less bleak - which is on PC, as well as Xbox Series and PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d like to try your hand at surviving while submerged in melted ice, ie: water, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> is hitting early access on PC and Xbox any day now. And by “now” I mean at some point in the coming year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d rather go on adventures above the waves, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sea-of-remnants">Sea of Remnants</a> is a bright and colorful ocean-world RPG, which is slated to hit PC and PS5 at some point. If you prefer rails to sails, there’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/denshattack">Denshattack</a>, which looks like Jet Grind Radio, except you play as a train. Sure why not! That’s on PC as well as Xbox Series and PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At some point <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> is coming out, which is FromSoftware’s Switch 2 exclusive foray into the world of PvE multiplayer, and I know I’m not the only one who’s disappointed that something that looks so much like Bloodborne isn’t an action RPG. Still, as arcane as this game looks, my intelligence is high enough that I’ll pump a few points into having faith that Hidetaka Miyazaki and company know what they’re doing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you ever wished Hotline Miami was about actual animal men and not just men in animal masks, well, get a load of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kusan-city-of-wolves">Kusan: City of Wolves</a> - it’s exactly what I just described. That’s coming to PC as well as Switch, Xbox Series and both PlayStations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake has been in development for several dumptrucks worth of hourglass-grade silica powder, but at some point this year, that’s supposedly coming out - and hopefully it’s worth the wait.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Ubisoft remake we’ve been hearing about for almost as long is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake">Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag</a>, which isn’t even officially announced, but will presumably come to modern consoles and PC if and when it ever gets released.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/valor-mortis">Valor Mortis</a> is another first-person action soulslike from the studio behind Ghostrunner, which seems like a novel enough idea and hopefully has less spiders than Decrepit - and it’s coming to Xbox Series, PS5, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally slated for a fall 2025 release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/directive-8020-a-dark-pictures-games">Directive 8020: A Dark Pictures Game</a> is the latest cinematic choose-your-own-adventure game from the folks at Supermassive, which is coming to Xbox Series, PS5, and PC. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> has been going strong on PC for a while now, and at some point in the foreseeable future, it’ll be getting Xbox Series and PS5 versions as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And last but not least, 2026 marks the 30th anniversary of the launch of the Pokémon series. In addition to Pokopia, we’re also getting the strategy game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-champions">Pokemon Champions</a> - I have a hunch those aren’t the only two Pokémon games that’ll be dropping this year, but they’re the only two we officially know about right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, there you go! That’s a look ahead at the biggest games coming in 2026 that we know about right now. Some of these might not actually come out in the next 12 months, but a whole lot more that I didn’t mention here that definitely will. If you want regular and slightly more accurate breakdowns of what games are coming on a more timely basis, keep an eye out for our monthly big game release videos - in fact, we should have one about January’s games, including a few that didn’t make it into this video.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I have no doubt in my mind that there’s some big huge obvious game coming out in 2026 that we forgot to mention, so please, whatever we forgot, share it in the comments. But also, and I always say this and very few people pay attention - tell us what the games we left out are about! Why should people care? Sharing a cool recommendation is one of the best feelings in the world, so if there’s a game you’re stoked on, tell us about it!</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-games-coming-in-2026]]></content:encoded>

If you've yet to catch up on the series, now is the best time to do so. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">Beyond the standard mainline games</a>, Persona has seen spin-offs here and there, but Persona 5, in particular, has seen a suite of them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona 5 Strikers from Omega Force is actually set after the events of Persona 5, and the recently released Persona 5: The Phantom X brings many new characters into the fold. However, the most interesting spin-off is arguably <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-5-tactica">Persona 5 Tactica</a>, a strategy-based spin-off that is similar to XCOM. If you've yet to check out this game, Best Buy has a great deal to pick up a copy for only $10.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Persona 5 Tactica for $9.99</h2><div catalogid="f81d571e-8633-4fda-abf5-4691903d0249" id="233992"><div id="233992" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Persona 5 Tactica - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona 5 Tactica falls in line with the story of Persona 5, with the game actually taking place during the base game. One day, the party is transported away to an alternate reality called a Kingdom, and these worlds are where Tactica takes place. DLC was also made available for Persona 5 Tactica, in the form of Repaint Your Heart, which brought back familiar faces Goro Akechi and Kasumi Yoshizawa.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In each Kingdom, you control up to three characters and move them around a grid-based map to take down enemies. Many of Persona 5's unique combat mechanics are implemented here in familiar ways, such as the 1 More mechanic when attacking an enemy and knocking them to the ground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.
