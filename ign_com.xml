A comic featured in the 2025 Sonic the Hedgehog Annual claimed the blue blur lived in Green Hill Zone, the iconic opening level to the original Sonic the Hedgehog.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Sonic lore has otherwise stated he's a drifter, roaming from place to place and never settling down, with even official channels like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=shared&amp;v=CnnqXIGA_UQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TailsTube</a> web series pointing to this fact.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Sonic Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans were therefore relieved to hear Sonic had settled down, while others were in an uproar, forcing the hand of Chris Hernandez, Sega's associate manager of Sonic the Hedgehog lore, who clarified the annual's claim was just a misprint.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Sorry to burst the bubble so late here," Hernandez said on <a href="https://x.com/MisterCrits/status/1856767895088570382" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>. "This was something we caught early on but it looks like an older draft got through on accident. Sonic doesn't have a home; he's still a drifter. Will work on making sure this doesn't happen again. Thanks for catching this."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sonic appears too busy to sit down and apply for a mortgage, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-will-tease-another-new-character-to-set-up-potential-fourth-film">his third film debuting on December 20</a> and bringing Shadow the Hedgehog to the cinematic universe.

Free Range Games‚Äô survival and crafting game first launched on PC as an Epic Games Store exclusive in October last year, before coming out on PS5 in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we‚Äôre on The Lord of the Rings, Embracer said Middle-earth Enterprises had a ‚Äúslow quarter‚Äù year-on-year (the July to September Q2), with no notable new partner releases, but a higher film revenue than expected. Embracer said it‚Äôs seen encouraging fan reactions to the marketing it‚Äôs doing for the December release of anime <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim">The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer had a brutal Q2 for PC and console games, with tough comparisons from last year‚Äôs <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/remnant-ii">Remnant 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a>. The most notable new release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a>, late in the quarter, ‚Äúwas well received by players but initial digital sales were slower than expected.‚Äù That‚Äôs corporate speak for a flop. In contrast, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/satisfactory-review">Satisfactory‚Äôs 1.0 launch on PC</a> ‚Äúperformed above management expectations,‚Äù which means it did great. Coffee Stain Studios‚Äô first-person open-world factory building game had over 200,000 concurrent players in September.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer has endured a tough time in recent years, laying off thousands of staff (the number of game developers working at the firm has decreased from 10,654 to 6,250) and selling a number of its studios, including Borderlands maker Gearbox and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 developer Saber Interactive. Today, it announced the sale of subsidiary puzzle game mobile developer Easybrain to digital games company Miniclip for $1.2 billion, which should keep the lights on for the foreseeable future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the rest of its financial year, Embracer is pinning its hopes on the hotly anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, which it said was still on track for its February 11, 2025 release date. It still owns Metro developer 4A Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metro-developer-makes-clear-playstation-vr2-game-awakening-isnt-next-mainline-metro-game">which is working on a brand new game in the series</a>. Asmodee, Embracer's tabletop games company, is still up for sale.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Over the past 15 months, we have created a stronger foundation for long-term value creation, lowering our net debt and our capex," Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have many high-performing and efficient companies, several with industry leading margins. However, we acknowledge that parts of our PC/Console and Entertainment &amp; Services segments are still underperforming due to delays and low ROI for primarily small and mid-sized releases. Combined with fixed operating costs this creates unacceptable margins which we are firmly addressing ahead of the spin-offs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other Embracer games in the works include Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, Fellowship, Gothic 1 Remake, Hyper Light Breaker, Killing Floor 3, REANIMAL, Satisfactory (console), Titan Quest II, Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered, and Wreckfest 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Three sidearms are available throughout the game, including the Cutlass Boomerang, Pistol, and Chain Hook.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things get particularly wild with the Dark Instruments, however. Majima will build up a Madness Gauge while fighting (separate to Heat Actions) that can be used to activate this new ability, with players able to choose between playing a violin, saxaphone, guitar, and the aforementioned ocarina.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Blowing into Majima‚Äôs cursed ocarina beckons a terrifying jellyfish to emerge from the briny deep," reads the description, which officially dubs the jellyfish the Dark God of the Deep. "This creature will heal Majima and his allies, as well as shock and immobilize nearby enemies."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The violin summons giant sharks which deal heavy damage, the guitar summons a "ferocious" ape that inflicts massive damage with limited range, and the saxaphone summons an "avian ally" that blows enemies away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a spin-off sequel to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>, the eighth mainline entry in the Yakuza / Like a Dragon series (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review">or ninth including Yakuza 0</a>). <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/majima-focused-like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-announced-at-rgg-summit-as-next-yakuza-game">It follows Majima</a> as he wakes up with amnesia and becomes a pirate, exploring the likes of Hawaii along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A trailer released at the October Xbox Partner Showcase revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-is-eating-assassins-creeds-lunch-in-new-trailer">a proper first look at ship combat akin to Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a> and the return of the beloved character Taiga Saejima, perhaps teasing more ties to the main series than previously thought.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will also be a decent bit longer than previous Yakuza spin-off Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-is-a-decent-bit-longer-than-previous-spin-off-like-a-dragon-gaiden">its story taking around 15 to 18 hours to complete</a>.
