            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The newest PlayStation hardware is acoustic.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The PlayStation store is selling guitars now. If you're a fan of Naughty Dog's Last of Us series, either the games or the TV show, you can now preorder a replica of Ellie's guitar that Joel customized with the custom moth inlay fretboard. This guitar was first featured in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us Part II</a> and made an appearance in the second season of the HBO series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The guitar is a collaboration with Taylor Guitars and is a special edition of the Taylor 314ce. You can preorder it for $2,999.99 at the PlayStation Store and it will officially release on November 18, 2025. It's listed in the PlayStation store's hardware section among various consoles, controllers, and other accessories.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Taylor 314ce The Last of Us Part II Replica Guitar</h2><div catalogid="09a8041f-5e7d-4130-8508-ecf1bff3e86c" id="227110"><div id="227110" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Taylor 314ce The Last of Us Part II Replica Guitar</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>The PlayStaton Store bundle includes a strap and replica case.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The guitar has distinctive rich tobacco sunburst top in Sitka spruce pulled straight from the game and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-spoiler-free">latest season of the TV show</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you think that $3,000 is a ridiculous amount of money to pay for a guitar, it's actually not <em>that</em> terribly priced, especially for a nice acoustic guitar. The standard Taylor 314ce costs around $2,499 on its own without the Last of Us details included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that Taylor is selling a <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjp1Ee?object_uuid=94cc8cdf-4912-495a-b122-00a9bf6fb1f1&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">slightly cheaper version of this replica</a> directly from its website. It's a Taylor 314c (rather than a 314ce) and it's priced at $2,799 without the bundled accessories.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What's next for The Last of Us?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This replica guitar is the latest piece of merch inspired by the popular <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-naughty-dog-games-in-order">Naughty Dog game</a> and likely won't be the last. But what about new games and episodes of the show? Game-wise, The Last of Us Part 3 has yet to be officially confirmed and it seems unlikely that it ever will be. Creator Neil Druckman has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">during an interview</a> to not "bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us.’ This could be it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the TV series, HBO CEO Casey Bloys <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-3-planned-for-2027-and-could-be-the-series-end-hbo-boss-says">confirmed</a> that Season 3 of the show is definitely planned to arrive in 2027. He also said that this season will potentially be the last run of episodes.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 19, 2025 10:30 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-opens-preorders-for-a-replica-of-the-guitar-from-the-last-of-us-part-ii]]></content:encoded>
