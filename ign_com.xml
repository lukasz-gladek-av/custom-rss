While not everyone may make the connection, you can see what appears to be a boxed copy of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/guitar-hero"><u>Guitar Hero</u></a> — or 'Banjo Champion' as it's been rebadged as here, albeit with all the Guitar Hero branding — stuffed into the can. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a particularly curious addition given the developer of the Guitar Hero series from Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock to 2010's Warriors of Rock was Neversoft… which also just-so-happened to have developed the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As fans debated whether or not it was an Easter egg, a joke, or even dig — at Neversoft, or publisher Activision — THPS 3+4 developer Iron Galaxy promptly distanced itself, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IronGalaxyDevTeam/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>writing</u></a>: "We have the utmost respect for anyone who makes games, we’re investigating how that got in there in the first place. Thank you to the community for bringing this to our attention and we’ll be removing that from the environment art in the next update."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some players have told Iron Galaxy not to worry as the "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/THPS/comments/1ly2f8i/comment/n2ryswf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>benign joke</u></a>" was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/THPS/comments/1ly2f8i/comment/n2qxb86/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>"nothing serious,"</u></a> and others say it's "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/THPS/comments/1ly2f8i/comment/n2tfsxk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>edgy, like the older THPS games</u></a>," the truth is the 'joke' has been around for years, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/THPS/comments/ilcj12/these_banjo_champion_guitar_hero_knockoffs_in_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>'Banjo Champion' references popped up in THPS 1+2, too</u></a>, five years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We thought the long-anticipated remake was great, slapping it with a 8 and writing in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review"><u>IGN's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 review</u></a>: "Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 proves yet again the series’ over-the-top skateboarding formula is totally timeless, even if some of the changes to THPS4 miss the mark and the soundtrack has been fumbled."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're just getting started, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-walkthrough-all-goals-collectibles-panda-plushies"><u>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 walkthrough</u></a>, where we take you through all nine levels, showing you how to get every collectible, goal, gold medal, and panda plushie en route to unlocking everything available before reaching Pro Goals in THPS 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Each week, GaG releases new content, and Saturday July 12, 2025 was no exception. This time, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/Pet_Mutation_Update"><strong>the Pet Mutation Event</strong></a> launched, so if your pet hits 50+, you can throw it in the mutation machine and see it returned to you with a new ability from <strong>12 possible variations</strong>!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pet Mutations</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/14/pet-mutations-promo-1752491976902.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The new Mutation Machine, where unsuspecting pets can be thrown in and transformed.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With the new Pet Mutation machine, it's not just plants that can receive mutations now. Where<strong> </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/All_Mutations_and_Multipliers_in_Grow_a_Garden"><strong>mutations and multipliers</strong></a> increase the value of your crops in Grow a Garden, pet mutations can give them new abilities. These range from the Golden mutation, which can boost a pet's passive ability, to Mega, which increases a pet's hunger, but also means they earn XP faster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/Pet_Mutation_Update"><strong>Pet Mutation Update page</strong></a> lists all the 12 possible mutations, as well as the <strong>chances for your pet to get them</strong>. Spoiler! Some traits like Ascended have just a 0.32% chance of being applied.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Primal Egg</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/14/primal-egg-promo-1752491981234.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The spiky brown and beige Primal Egg with a bone image on the side.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With an update focused on pets, it's no surprise that there's a new Pet Egg for us to earn. Following the release of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/The_Animal_Update_-_Pet_Egg_Guide"><strong>Animal Update</strong></a>, we've regularly seen new Pet Eggs added to GaG. This time, it's the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/How_to_Get_Primal_Egg_and_All_Pets"><strong>Primal Egg</strong></a>. There are <strong>3 Legendary, 2 Mythical, and 1 Divine Pet</strong> up for grabs in this egg. Be sure to visit our guide to see all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/How_to_Get_Primal_Egg_and_All_Pets#All_Primal_Egg_Pets"><strong>chances for a Pet to appear in the Primal Egg</strong></a>, as well as each of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/How_to_Get_Primal_Egg_and_All_Pets#All_Primal_Egg_Pet_Traits"><strong>new abilities and traits</strong></a> that the Primal Egg Pets have.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Prehistoric Event Expansion</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/14/bone-blossom-promo-example-1752491827550.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Bone Blossom that resembles a skull and crossbones, where the skull is instead a nectarine.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The previous update to Grow a Garden launched the Prehistoric Event, which came with a set of daily <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/Prehistoric_Event_and_Rewards"><strong>Dino Quests and rewards</strong></a>. The final reward in this series of quests, is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/How_to_Get_Bone_Blossom"><strong>Bone Blossom</strong></a>. You can still get it as the Prehistoric Event has been expanded, so be sure to <strong>complete 21 quests</strong> to get your hands on it before it's too late! If you missed out on the Candy Blossom, you won't want to miss out on this one. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">New Gear</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With the requirement that <strong>pets need to reach 50+ before you can throw them in the Mutation Machine</strong>, it makes sense that we'd see the addition of new gear to help you level up your pets. Some of this new gear, like the Levelup Lollipop can be purchased in the shop, which you'll find listed in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/Grow_a_Garden_Gear_Guide"><strong>our Gear Guide</strong></a>. Other items, which give a boost to XP and passive abilities for pets, you'll find in the<strong> </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/All_Crafting_Recipes"><strong>recipe list at the Crafting/Cosmetics Stall</strong></a> instead.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New Seeds</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding off the Pet Mutation update, it wouldn't be Grow a Garden without new seeds for us to plant. There are five new seeds, but <strong>only one of these can be purchased from the Seed Stall</strong>. This is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/How_to_Get_Giant_Pinecone"><strong>Giant Pinecone</strong></a>. To get hold of the others including the<strong> </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/How_to_Get_Horsetail"><strong>Horsetail Seed</strong></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/How_to_Get_Amber_Spine"><strong>Amber Spine</strong></a>, you'll need to craft them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more Grow a Garden help, or if you're just getting started with this farming experience on Roblox, visit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden"><strong>our wiki</strong></a>.
