            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Stop Killing Games</u></a> initiative has reached the crucial 1 million signatures milestone in its quest to preserve video games for decades to come, but its fight isn’t over yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The self-described consumer movement soared past the goal yesterday, July 3, cementing its status as an impressive petition in gaming history and a movement that has plenty of gas left in the tank. It’s all in the name of protecting the video games players love – and even the ones they don’t – as the industry steadily marches toward a digital future.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">A lot of games we buy today are built to just stop working when the publisher pulls the plug on em. It needs to stop. If you are EU citizen please consider signing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/stopkillinggames?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#stopkillinggames</a> initiative. <a href="https://t.co/vlyIEXcpnh" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/vlyIEXcpnh</a> <a href="https://t.co/nsTusFyGrL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/nsTusFyGrL</a></p>— Pat_ (@Pat8_8) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pat8_8/status/1940300022526222441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Social media feeds have since filled with reactions from supporters praising an operation that could help save multiplayer and single-player games for future generations. While gamers take to the internet to celebrate, spokesperson and organizer Ross Scott says reaching 1 million signatures is good news but far from a victory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“OK, the breaking news: The European Citizens’ Initiative has crossed 1 million signatures – except it hasn’t,” Scott said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmkCQJrc9n4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a video update</u></a> uploaded yesterday. “This is going to kill morale, but there are two things going on here. The first we knew was coming. Every time somebody makes a mistake when they sign the Initiative, their signature gets invalidated. So that means we need more signatures to make up for everybody’s mistakes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an important variable in the equation on the road to 1 million legitimate Stop Killing Games endorsements, and it’s just one flaw to consider. The other involves reports Scott has received regarding fabricated signatures that could be artificially inflating the initiative’s progress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“First off, I want to say that this is not a Change.org petition,” Scott adds. “This is a government process. Spoofing signatures on it is a crime. Please do not do this. They’ll be checked later by the EU commission, and my guess is the fake ones will get turned over to the Europol or Interpol, and they’ll follow up on this.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">To anyone who made a mistake or isn't sure if they signed the EU initiative already, you can contact the official spokesperson (Daniel Ondruska) and he can direct you on how to reach the EU to sort it out. His contact is on the page under "more info"<a href="https://t.co/EpnNTDR85U" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/EpnNTDR85U</a></p>— Accursed Farms (@accursedfarms) <a href="https://twitter.com/accursedfarms/status/1941018169977852169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">To account for what could be a significant number of invalid Stop Killing Games signatures, the initiative has altered its ideal goal to be 1.4 million signatures. At the time of this story’s publication, Stop Killing Games has reached 1.07 million endorsements ahead of its July 31 end date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, yeah, that sucks,” Scott continued. “We’ll just keep plodding away unless we can figure out what the safe numbers are. Sorry this isn’t a big victory celebration. This is just kind of suspenseful and tense instead, and will probably hurt the morale of people signing.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save States</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Scott, who has created gaming content via his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Accursed_Farms" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Accursed Farms</u></a> YouTube channel for more than a decade, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w70Xc9CStoE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>launched</u></a> Stop Killing Games in April 2024 as a direct response to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-crew-delisted-from-all-digital-storefronts-servers-shut-down-early-2024"><u>Ubisoft’s decision to shut down its popular open-world racing game, The Crew</u></a>. The movement aims to create a ripple effect that could shake the industry into keeping games online long after players lose interest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It means everything from The Crew to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-concords-servers-now-closed-fans-wonder-if-itll-return-as-free-to-play-at-least-one-expert-has-doubts"><u>Concord</u></a> could theoretically remain online to enjoy should the initiative amass enough public complaints to see the European Commission pass a law protecting consumer rights. Ideally, players could see live-service and multiplayer titles like BioWare’s Anthem, which was given <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-will-shut-down-anthem-in-january"><u>a shutdown schedule</u></a> just yesterday, could continue on in some form should a publisher decide to sunset support. Success could also mean single-player games that rely on online components, such as Death Stranding or Dark Souls, could remain intact, too.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>WEAK</p><p>I know Anthem got panned, but it's another example of one that seems like it had a cool looking world to run around in. I was interested in trying it out and keeping my expectations low. Yet another example of why SKG is so needed.<a href="https://t.co/fDsq0ZsP8K" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/fDsq0ZsP8K</a></p></div>— Accursed Farms (@accursedfarms) <a href="https://twitter.com/accursedfarms/status/1940891094214226104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Stop Killing Games wants to save the art that developers pour their hearts into while protecting consumers who prefer to access games they’ve already paid for, and it’s a movement that hundreds of thousands of game players are already supporting. Following its promising launch last year, however, the initiative struggled to maintain the support it needed to push its way through to the eyes that needed to see it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stop Killing Games’ chances at a successful campaign became so dire that Scott went as far as to publish a video titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfRLujXtUo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The end of Stop Killing Games</u></a>” just last week. In the hour-long explainer piece, Scott listed a lack of exposure as one primary cause behind the lack of support. It was the Hail Mary the initiative needed, though, as prominent YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_5WIzkM0r8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jacksepticeye</u></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJpTCitKqw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>penquinz0/Cr1TiKaL</u></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlmulltSgWg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ludwig</u></a>, and more were quick to voice their support with their own videos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All within the weeks since Scott shared his concerns, Stop Killing Games has gained hundreds of thousands of signatures, resulting in a solid chunk of the more than 1 million names attached to the movement today. Success remains uncertain even if Scott is able to reach that magic 1.4 million number, with even more uncertainty lying on the other side of that goal post. Still, as outlined by Scott on the Stop Killing Games website, he feels optimistic about the future of game preservation if the signature goal is met.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If we can pass the signature threshold," Scott says, "there is a very strong chance that the European Commission will pass new law that will both protect consumer rights to retain video games that customers have purchased and advance preservation efforts massively."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Should the word get out to enough interested individuals, players could see somewhat of a return to the days when buying a game came with the assurance that it would remain playable regardless of post-launch interference.

Could we be looking at the woods around the Arklay Mountains, near Raccoon City? We can just about glimpse a mountain range in the background, so it's possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to imagine a real-time shooter taking advantage of the events seen in and around the Resident Evil game, where several teams of STARS commandos — characters that fans have now grown to care about — most be poked and prodded into action, while kept alive for as long as you can. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/04/gu-nhjaw0aa2prp-1751619726566.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Resident Evil Survival Unit.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">An accompanying press release states that Survival Unit is "designed to appeal to both long-time fans and new players," suggesting we will see some familiar faces or settings here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And with the main series headed back to Raccoon City in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, and supposedly picking up the storyline of Umbrella, now seems a good time to revisit the setting and events that started it all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Survival Unit will launch in Japan, South Korea, North America, Europe, and Asia, published by anime company Aniplex, a subsidiary of Sony.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid the video game cancelations and studio closures that have come as a result of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">Microsoft’s devastating round of layoffs this week</a> is concern about the fate of pretty much every Xbox game without a firm release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft games canceled as part of the cuts include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox">Rare’s Everwild</a>, an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-unannounced-mmo-was-doing-well-and-even-scaling-up-as-xbox-cancelation-blindsided-staff-sources-say">unannounced MMO from ZeniMax Online Studios</a>, the developer of The Elder Scrolls Online, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">the Perfect Dark Reboot</a>. The latter's developer, The Initiative, was shut down. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-says-warcraft-rumble-wont-get-any-new-content-as-microsoft-layoffs-hit-development-team">The team working on Blizzard’s mobile game Warcraft Rumble was laid off as new content ceased</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, external developers who were funded by Microsoft were also hit. Romero Games, the studio founded by Doom co-creator John Romero and Brenda Romero, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/update-romero-games-employee-says-whole-studio-subject-to-layoffs-after-microsoft-pulls-funding-for-new-shooter-from-doom-co-creator-john-romero">has suffered significant layoffs and the future of its new shooter is in doubt</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a lot to take in, but it begs the question: which Xbox Game Studios games remain? And which, if any, were quietly canceled?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a memo sent to all Microsoft gaming staff and viewed by IGN this week, Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios, said Microsoft still has "more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, a source told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> that every game featured at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced">the Xbox Games Showcase presentation in June</a> is continuing on. So, what were those games, which we now assume are safe — at least for the time being?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was at the show, and is certain to come out later this year (despite the layoffs hitting its various developers). inXile game Clockwork Revolution starred at the show, so that’s safe. Obsidian’s Grounded 2 and The Outer Worlds 2 were at the show and we should assume are both safe. It's a similar deal for Double Fine’s Keeper, The Coalition’s Gears of War: Reloaded, Ninja Gaiden 4, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s Order of the Giants DLC. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4, and the ROG Xbox Ally, both at the show, will continue too. Despite the cancelation of Everwild, Rare’s Sea of Thieves continues with new updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the showcase, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-teases-return-of-halo-in-2026-and-its-reportedly-a-halo-combat-evolved-remaster">Xbox boss Phil Spencer teased Forza, Fable, Gears of War: E-Day, and a Halo: Combat Evolved remake for 2026</a>. We assume since those games were mentioned, they’re safe,  although it’s worth noting that the Forza mentioned by Spencer no doubt relates to the next Forza Horizon game from Playground, which is also making Fable. Turn 10, which makes the more sim-focused Forza games, was hit hard by the layoffs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, we know which games Microsoft still intends to release. But, given the events of this week, it’s now impossible to think about other Xbox games in the works without a degree of concern. Everwild and Perfect Dark were conspicuous by their absence at last month's show and both were canceled. What else failed to turn up?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Minecraft — remember Microsoft owns Minecraft! — remains huge and safe as houses, you feel. But what about Contraband from Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios? Where’s Undead Labs’ State of Decay 3? Ninja Theory’s Project Mara? Microsoft has a Hideo Kojima game, OD, on its books. Is that still happening? Toys for Bob, the Crash Bandicoot 4 developer and Call of Duty support studio that left the Xbox-owned Activision in February 2024, signed an agreement with Xbox directly to publish its next game. Is that still alive?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what about Bethesda? ZOS’s MMO has fallen by the wayside, but surely Bethesda Game Studios' The Elder Scrolls VI and the next Fallout are fine. Starfield’s promised next expansion feels precarious, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-starfields-xbox-no-show-even-its-most-loyal-fans-are-starting-to-worry-bethesda-makes-it-so-hard-to-defend-this-game">given Bethesda's radio silence on the game</a>. And what about Blizzard? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-working-on-a-starcraft-shooter-with-ex-far-cry-chief-dan-hay-at-the-helm">As of last year it was reportedly hard at work on a StarCraft shooter</a>. Is that still the case?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s only when you run through what <em>wasn’t</em> at the Xbox Games Showcase last month that you realize what’s at stake here: Microsoft owns a huge number of development studios across the globe, from Bethesda to Blizzard and Activision to Halo. When Xbox suffers significant problems, a huge swathe of the video game industry and its developers do, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are on August's gamescom, where Microsoft is expected to show more of what is has coming down the line. Perhaps Phil Spencer will give fans a clear idea of what’s in the works from Xbox and what isn't as Microsoft's multiplatform push soldiers on. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-first-party-next-generation-xbox-consoles-announces-deal-with-amd-and-promises-full-backwards-compatibility-with-your-existing-xbox-library">It is still planning to release a next-gen Xbox console</a>, although we don't know when. Is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-plans-to-release-an-xbox-handheld-but-its-years-away">the first-party Xbox handheld Spencer teased</a> last year also still alive? Does Microsoft still plan to release its own gaming app store, despite the failure of <a href="https://in.ign.com/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile/231166/news/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-activision-shuts-down-its-battle-royale-mobile-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Call of Duty Warzone Mobile</a>, Warcraft Rumble, and this week's significant cuts to Candy Crush maker King? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the short term, at least, the games we saw in June are still on the way. But the long term future of Xbox remains vague indeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

If you were planning on ordering any other DK figures (like those above), or games, like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-pokemon-legends-z-a-preorders-exclusive-mega-evolution-bundle-uk"><u>various bundles for Pokemon Legends: Z-A</u></a>, you may as preorder one of those now and save yourself a few pounds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve checked by adding both items to my basket testing the checkout and, even though Pokemon Legends: Z-A is releasing later than the Donkey Kong &amp; Pauline amiibo on October 16 (meaning both will arrive via separate deliveries), shipping will still be free for the entire order.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The amiibo announcement follows a jam-packed Nintendo Direct showcasing Donkey Kong Bananza’s return to 3D platforming. New features include wild Bananza transformations, skill trees, a costume shop, and the creative DK Artist Mode where players sculpt and paint items and characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza drops in just a couple of weeks, and with this amiibo, you’ll be more than ready to swing into action and have a cool figure in your display.</p></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 4, 2025 7:28 am</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-pauline-amiibo-up-for-uk-preorder-at-1699-with-bananza-bonuses]]></content:encoded>
