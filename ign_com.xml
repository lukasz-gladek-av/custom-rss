The popular game is all about using your imagination to build just about anything out of digital blocks, and LEGO is the ideal medium to bring that into the real world. There are already a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-minecraft-sets">ton of LEGO Minecraft sets</a> out there and more are on the way. Now that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-a-minecraft-movie">A Minecraft Movie is in theaters</a>, Amazon is offering some pretty steep discounts on older sets that are actually really cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although there were some newer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-minecraft-movie-lego-sets-where-to-buy">Minecraft Movie LEGO sets</a> released earlier this year, none of those have gone on sale. If you're a fan of the game itself and not just interested because of the new movie, however, the sets that <em>are </em>on sale are worth a look.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Minecraft LEGO Sets on Sale at Amazon Today</h2><div id="218161" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="928b6967-86f1-42d0-98c5-1e6fd6f3441d"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Minecraft The Sword Outpost</h3></p></div><div catalogid="928b6967-86f1-42d0-98c5-1e6fd6f3441d" id="218162"><div id="218162" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Minecraft The Deep Dark Battle Set</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Although there are other LEGO Minecraft deals available on Amazon, the two options we've featured here are the best overall savings. First there's The Sword Outpost set, which is recognizable by the massive sword backdrop, of course. At just over $30, this is the lowest price we've seen on this set all year and close to the lowest-ever price on Amazon. It also comes with quite a few minifigures, including Skeleton and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Creeper">Creeper</a> mobs. With only 427 pieces, it's fairly easy to put together in an afternoon and can be easily displayed or played with once you're done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second discount we've highlighted here is The Deep Dark Battle Set. At $44.49, this is the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0BBSMSX9Z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest price we've ever seen</a> on this LEGO Minecraft set. This particular set takes you to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Deep_Dark">Deep Dark</a> and offers some cool functionality for kids. There's a knob included in the build that lets you raise and lower the Warden. The tower can also "explode" with a built-in switch. You only get two minifigures with this set, but each one comes with armor and weapons you can equip them with.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">See more popular LEGO Minecraft sets</h3><h2 data-cy="title2">What About the Minecraft Movie LEGO Sets?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There have only been two Minecraft Movie LEGO sets released so far: The Ghast Balloon Village Attack and Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring. Both of these sets reflect specific scenes from the movie and include minifigures of the characters, including Jack Black as Steve.</p></div><div id="215965" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="0f3e36ea-4367-4f3f-80b5-d721970e0438"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Ghast Balloon Village Attack</h3></p></div><div id="215966" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="0f3e36ea-4367-4f3f-80b5-d721970e0438"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring</h3></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 3, 2025 10:00 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="article-subtitle">Not yet available for streaming.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
