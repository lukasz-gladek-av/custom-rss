            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite is set to add pet-like cosmetic "Companions" to its battle royale, a series of fresh leaks suggest. Initial designs include a range of dogs, as well as a turtle on a skateboard. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Datamined images sourced from yesterday's new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> season update show what looks to be a golden retriever, a pair of pugs, a robot dog based on the game's iconic Cuddle Team Leader, and the aforementioned skateboard-wielding aquatic reptile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite fans have been aware of plans by developer Epic Games to release pet-like Companions for some time, based on bits of evidence dug up and posted online from past datamines. But today is our first glimpse at the Companions themselves, from what look to be user interface icons for them. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If Fortnite having pets sounds familiar, well, that's because the game <em>technically </em>has them already. During the early years of Fortnite battle royale, at least, the game offered "Pets" â€” animated animals â€” that you wore as a "backbling", or essentially like a rucksack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around a dozen or so of these Pets were released, usually within battle passes, with later designs becoming slightly more elaborate (a floating mind-controlling alien named Choppy is a personal fave, alongside a licensed Baby Yoda). But more recent years have seen Pets left by the wayside, despite fan calls for their return. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">â€” Fortnite Leaks ðŸ•œ (@FortniteFNLK) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteFNLK/status/1953578096960938007?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Epic Games is believed to be working on Companions as a far more evolved version of Pets, with the creatures able to scamper around in-game near your player character. Fans expect that these creatures will be visible to you and your squad of allies, though perhaps not to enemy players â€” so there's no blowing up of your new turtle buddy to be had.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, Epic Games is yet to acknowledge Companions as being in development, and it's still unclear if they will arrive this season. Whenever they do launch, however, Companions will be the first new cosmetic type introduced to Fortnite since November 2024, when the game introduced Kicks, better known as shoes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday's big Fortnite update saw the game launch a new alien bug-infested season for its main battle royale portion, while Fortnite OG shifted into the beloved season where Kevin the Cube first appeared. Although, as we previously reported, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/something-is-wrong-fortnite-is-doing-something-strange-but-brilliant-with-its-og-mode-which-is-now-no-longer-just-a-carbon-copy-of-the-original">strange things are going on in Fortnite OG</a> â€” where the timeline appears to be occuring slightly differently this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

And yes, that's as specific as publisher Konami is currently willing to get. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-has-an-online-multiplayer-mode-called-fox-hunt-with-completely-different-gameplay-than-metal-gear-online">back in June</a>, Fox Hunt is an entirely new multiplayer offering unrelated to Metal Gear Online, which came bundled with Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots back in 2008. MGO lasted four years, before its servers were switched off in 2012.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Fox Hunt is a completely original online multiplayer mode," said veteran Metal Gear Solid developer Yu Sahara, who now acts as the mode's director, back in June. "Although it shares the same world with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the gameplay is completely different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we say Metal Gear multiplayer, many fans will probably think of Metal Gear Online, but Fox Hunt will be its own new type of mode. We very much appreciate all the long-time fans of MGO who have always wanted to see it make a comeback, but the landscape of multiplayer games has changed a lot since MGO. It took a lot of careful consideration to think about what a new online mode should look like."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sahara continued by saying that Fox Hunt would focus on Metal Gear series' stealth and survival elements, and take "camouflage and hide and go seek to the next level" in order to ensure the mode offered "more than just a shootout."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of Fox Hunt, Delta is a remake of the 2004 classic Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Original Metal Gear creator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-he-wont-play-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-laughs">Hideo Kojima has said he won't be playing</a>, however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The series, which will feature kid-friendly animated episodes just one-minute in length, will launch alongside a major new push by Nintendo for the kid's product market, with a range of toys, picture books, and more released under a new "My Mario" banner. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, this range includes a set of wooden blocks that you can use as amiibo figurines. Other products on the way include a set of plastic tableware, a board book, a backpack, a plushie Mario, rattles and items of baby and toddler clothing including T-shirts and Mario hoodie.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/08/mymario-products-1024x575-1754642331685.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nintendo's My Mario range.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My Mario has interactive elements too, including a My Mario app for smartphones and Switch consoles where you can play with Mario's face, like a 2D version of the Mario 64 start menu. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Hello Mario app will launch for iPhone and Android devices on August 26 in Japan, with the rest of the My Mario range set to arrive there on August 28.
