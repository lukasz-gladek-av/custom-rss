            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-details-summer-city-events-featuring-a-big-red-truck-its-driving-round-europe<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> will continue its summer events plan by driving a big red truck around seven cities in Europe, beginning in the UK next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Manchester will host the tour's first stop, before subsequent visits to London, Paris, Valencia, Berlin, Den Haag in the Netherlands and finally Cologne, just in time for Gamescom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players who make the trip to a host city will get an array of bonuses around the truck location, including Phanphy, Venipede and Wooloo spawns with boosted Shiny rates, plus raids for a costumed summer Pikachu with the possibility of a Location Background. Timed Research, meanwhile, will offer up a Varoom — the engine-like Pokémon. Plus, of course, you get to look at the big red Pokémon Go truck.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Across the host city, other bonuses will be activated — including 3-hour lures and up to 5 Special Trades per day. Nationwide, meanwhile, Timed Research advertising the upcoming arrival of the Road Trip will award the same summer costumed Pikachu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Pokémon Go announced an unprecedented $20 event pass featuring the game's first Golden Bottle Cap item — something that will allow players to increase a Pokémon's stats until they are a rare 100%. Ahead of the item's introduction, fans expressed concern the feature could see the game straying into pay-to-win territory, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-developer-addresses-pay-to-win-fears-as-it-introduces-unprecedented-20-premium-pass-with-gold-bottle-cap-that-boosts-a-pokmons-stats-to-100">something director Michael Steranka discussed at length in our exclusive interview</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Separately, IGN also chatted with Steranka about this year's biggest change — that Pokémon Go is now owned by Monopoly Go! maker Scopely, a company backed by the Saudi-founded Savvy Games. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-director-talks-new-ownership-says-saudi-backing-wont-see-demands-such-as-cristiano-ronaldo-added-to-the-game-yeah-thats-a-little-bit-not-our-vibe">How will the change impact the game?</a> IGN put that question to Steranka as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/help-us-rank-the-biggest-games-from-summer-of-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">All the big summer presentations are now complete, which means we now have a pretty clear picture as to what games we’ll be playing over the next year or so. Across IGN’s Summer of Gaming we’ve seen plenty of exciting reveals, from the debut of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> as part of Summer Game Fest (arriving next February!) to the big <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clockwork-revolution">Clockwork Revolution</a> trailer during the Xbox Games Showcase (which launches… when it launches.) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With more than a dozen presentations held over the last few weeks, there has been at least a little something for everyone. Cozy gamers found games to love among the trailers featured in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS_nFj3inRw&amp;ab_channel=IGN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wholesome Direct</a>, fans of the grimdark future got excited about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-returns-space-marine-master-crafted-edition-and-more-all-the-announcements-and-trailers-from-warhammer-skulls-2025">Warhammer Skulls</a>, and first-party devotees feasted on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">PlayStation’s State of Play</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. But with everything now out in the wild, it’s time for the hard work: to rank the biggest reveals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve selected the 25 biggest games of the season, based on a multitude of factors (including trailer and page views, social media chatter, and staff excitement) and entered them into a Tier List. Where each of those 25 games sits on the Tier List is up to you. S rank is for the most exciting, D rank is for the games you think show little promise, and then there’s space for everything else in between. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the 25 games are many that have an easy shot at hitting S rank. Resident Evil Requiem proved itself as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-trailers-of-summer-of-gaming">biggest, most-watched trailer of the season</a>, and our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview">hands-on preview</a> suggests it's certainly one to watch. And how about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/invincible-vs">Invincible VS</a>, which looks like a fantastic tag-team fighter as well as a pitch-perfect adaptation of the beloved comics? Then there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> with its cinematic first trailer – but will the Bond film vibes be matched by worthy gameplay? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other games are tricker to rank. We finally, after years of waiting, saw Capcom’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, but does it look as exciting as you’d hoped it would? How about the announcement of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-1-remake-officially-in-development-at-bloober-team-konami-has-announced">Silent Hill remake</a>? We’ve not seen a second of it, but it <em>is</em> being developed by Bloober Team, who knocked it out the park with its Silent Hill 2 remake. And then there’s sentient lighthouse simulator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/keeper">Keeper</a>, Double Fine’s long-awaited return, but its debut trailer seemed to keep at least a few cards close to its chest. Where will all these games (and more) rank? It's up to you to decide. </p><div id="summer-of-gaming-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Summer of Gaming Tier List</h3><h3>Summer of Gaming Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from IGN's Summer of Gaming, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-most-anticipated-games-from-summer-of-gaming">most anticipated games of the season</a>, as well as this month's IGN First, which is all about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a>. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
