            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">NCSoft and Sony surprised PlayStation fans this week by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-and-ncsoft-announce-horizon-steel-frontiers-a-new-mobile-first-mmorpg-set-in-guerrillas-horizon-universe-check-out-the-debut-trailer">announcing a Horizon MMO that’s not actually coming to PlayStation</a>. Horizon Steel Frontiers is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game designed for mobile devices, but it will also be playable on PC. NCSoft is working closely with original Horizon developer Guerrilla Games to craft the world, but this is very much an NCSoft-developed game. And based on the reveal trailer, below, it looks like it, too. Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-trailer-breakdown">Horizon Steel Frontiers trailer breakdown to find out what we could gather from the video</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say Horizon Steel Frontiers has sparked a debate among fans of Aloy’s adventures. While much of the game world looks familiar, there is much about Steel Frontiers that is different — including the look of the characters you can create and those you can bump into. Guerrilla’s Horizon games go for a realistic look, particularly when it comes to their characters. The developers have maintained this style throughout their Horizon games, starting with 2017’s breakout hit Zero Dawn through to VR game Call of the Mountain and Forbidden West expansion Burning Shores.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Steel Frontiers, developed by South Korean game company NCSoft (Lineage) not only with Guerrilla’s blessing but in close partnership with the team, is going for a stylized look for its characters, as can be seen clearly in the gameplay reveal trailer. But don’t expect “extreme cartoon-like features,” its developer has said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an exclusive interview with IGN following the reveal, Sunggu Lee, executive producer of Horizon Steel Frontiers at NCSoft, answered questions around character creation, gameplay, social features, Steel Frontiers’ place in the Horizon universe, the influence of Capcom's Monster Hunter, and perhaps the most important question of all: is Aloy in the game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How did the partnership between Sony and NCSoft come to be, and how did the idea for Horizon Steel Frontiers come about?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>When I first played Horizon Zero Dawn back in 2017, I was blown away by the incredible graphics and gameplay. It made me think, “How amazing would it be to explore this world with other players?” That simple but powerful feeling — the desire to share a great single-player experience with others — is what sparked the idea for Horizon Steel Frontiers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At NCSoft, we’ve always had a strong foundation in MMORPGs, and I believed that if we could bring the rich, captivating world of Horizon into that space, we could create something truly unique — an MMORPG unlike anything players have seen before. So, we started talking with Sony, the IP holder, and those conversations eventually led to the game we’re revealing today: Horizon Steel Frontiers.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/sunggu-lee-executive-producer-of-horizon-steel-frontiers-ncsoft-02-1763058507077.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sunggu Lee, executive producer of Horizon Steel Frontiers at NCSoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: In the announcement video, Guerrilla Games studio head Jan-Bart van Beek says Horizon Steel Frontiers was designed specifically for mobile. Can it also be played on PC, and how does the game take advantage of PC?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>For mobile, we streamlined the original console-based controls to make them more intuitive. To address the challenges of long-range aiming, we restructured combat to focus more on melee and introduced a smart lock-in system, so battles feel smooth and intuitive even on mobile. On PC, we take full advantage of the larger screen and precise controls, delivering deep, immersive experiences like large-scale raids and extended co-op missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mobile offers quick, on-the-go session play, while PC provides a richer, more strategic combat experience — each platform playing to its strengths. We’re developing both versions to deliver top-tier quality and a true cross-platform experience, so players can team up and hunt together anytime, anywhere, without being limited by their device.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Which PC platforms will it be available on?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>As mentioned earlier, Horizon Steel Frontiers is being developed as a true cross-platform experience for both mobile and PC (PURPLE, which is NCSoft’s integrated game platform).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Are you using Guerrilla’s Decima engine? If not, how will gameplay feel different in Steel Frontiers?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>Horizon Steel Frontiers is being developed using Unreal Engine 5. The original Decima engine is incredible — it delivered stunning graphics and amazing asset quality that made Horizon so iconic. Bringing those high-quality resources over to Unreal Engine 5 was no small challenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We worked closely with Guerrilla to make sure we preserved the visual fidelity of the original, while creating gameplay that feels unique to Steel Frontiers. Leveraging Unreal Engine 5’s powerful graphics capabilities, we’re able to deliver breathtaking visuals and smooth multiplayer experiences across both mobile and PC (PURPLE).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: From the way players team up to take down creatures, it looks like there’s a fair amount of Monster Hunter in Steel Frontiers. Is it fair to say this was an inspiration?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>Yes, that’s right — Monster Hunter was definitely one of the key inspirations for Steel Frontiers. When we started expanding Horizon’s core concept of hunting massive machines into a multiplayer experience, the cooperative hunting system from the Monster Hunter series felt like a natural reference point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the very beginning, combining Horizon’s rich world with the hunting-action genre just made sense. And when you add Horizon’s unique machine ecosystem, the part-breaking mechanics, and its deep storytelling, you get something that feels truly distinctive—an experience that’s uniquely Steel Frontiers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How does the combat in this game differ compared to that in the Horizon games?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>Both games share the core idea of taking down massive machines by targeting and breaking parts to weaken them — but as you can see in the trailer, the combat itself is quite different. In the original, ranged combat with a bow is the foundation. Players slow down time to line up precise shots and match elemental attributes to machine weaknesses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Steel Frontiers, it’s all about managing distance and making quick decisions — when to attack and when to dodge. We’ve kept the tension and excitement of the original hunts, but redesigned the combat to deliver a fresh experience that’s optimized for multiplayer hunting action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: There’s a big sand snake-looking machine at 8:18 in the video. Can you tell us what they’re called and what they do?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>The machine you see at 8:18 in the trailer is the Rockbreaker. It’s one of the most memorable machines from the original game — known for moving freely underground and then bursting through the surface for sudden, devastating attacks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Steel Frontiers, we’ve kept that ambush style intact but added new patterns to fit a multiplayer environment. One example is a massive sandpit attack that threatens the entire team. Overcoming it requires tight coordination and role-based teamwork, which makes the fight even more intense and rewarding.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/horizonsteelfrontiers-keyart-1-1763059001122.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Horizon Steel Frontiers is playable on mobile and PC. Image credit: NCSoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Are there player hubs, such as cities?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>Yes, absolutely. Steel Frontiers is set in the Deadlands, a vast region inspired by Arizona and New Mexico. Scattered across this landscape are multiple hub towns, which serve as the central gathering points for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These towns are where everything starts — you prepare for hunts, upgrade your gear, meet other players, and form parties. Each town has its own unique character and also acts as a gateway to nearby hunting zones. After every adventure, you’ll return to these hubs, making them the heart of the game’s social and gameplay experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What social aspects will the game have that let you interact with other players?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>In Steel Frontiers, towns and guilds are really the heart of the community. Towns act as central hubs where players gather, prepare for hunts, and naturally connect with others. Out in the field, you might team up spontaneously with players you meet, or join forces in planned, strategic co-op play to take down tougher machines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These moments — whether unexpected or carefully coordinated — help strengthen bonds between players. And of course, we support all the core social features you’d expect from an MMORPG, like friends lists, chat, and party systems, so players can communicate and collaborate seamlessly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How does Horizon Steel Frontiers fit within the overall Horizon timeline? Is it set within the same universe as the previous games? Does it take place before or after any events we’re already familiar with?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>Horizon Steel Frontiers takes place in the same universe as the original, but in a completely different region — the Deadlands. While Aloy and her allies are fighting for the fate of the world in the north, the southern Deadlands face a new threat. Players step into the role of machine hunters drawn to this dangerous frontier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As an MMORPG, every player becomes the hero of their own story, shaping their journey in the Deadlands. It’s another adventure unfolding in the same world, parallel to the epic saga of the original game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is Aloy in the game at all, or any other familiar Horizon characters?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>We haven’t finalized whether characters from the original game will appear, so it’s too early to share any specific plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The characters shown off in the announcement video have what would be considered ‘pretty’ or ‘cute’ faces. Was there a conscious effort to let players create such characters, despite them not fitting tonally with what we’ve seen in previous Horizon video games from Guerrilla?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>We’re building a character customization system that lets players create the style they want — from realistic designs like the original game to the more stylized characters often preferred in Asian markets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, because the original Horizon is based on realistic human proportions, we won’t support extreme cartoon-like features, such as oversized eyes or tiny chins. Our goal is to offer as much variety as possible within realistic features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be honest, we’re not quite at the level of stylization we’d like yet (laughs), but we’re making steady progress. By launch, we’re confident the customization options will satisfy both fans of the original and new players looking for creative freedom.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How many players can group together to take on a machine?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>In our announcement trailer, we showed a pre-alpha build of raid combat, but the exact scale hasn’t been finalized yet. Because Steel Frontiers is all about observing patterns and responding at the right moment, raids will involve fewer players compared to traditional MMOs. If the group is too large, individual roles can get diluted and the fight becomes chaotic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, we’re testing different group sizes, and the ideal number will vary depending on the machine type and difficulty. Our goal is to support everything from small parties to mid-sized raids, ensuring that every player feels their contribution matters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Can you explain how tribes will compete with each other, and how you’re able to fight over resources? Will players have to pick a tribe to join? Will you compete to own areas of the world as territory?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>In Steel Frontiers, tribal conflict plays out very differently from the original. The Deadlands isn’t home to established tribes — it’s a frontier where hunters from all over gather in search of opportunity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From a gameplay perspective, we’re focusing less on traditional MMO-style territory wars and more on cooperative structures built around hunting massive machines in the field. At its core, Steel Frontiers is a game where collaboration matters more than conflict. Machines like Slaughterspine or Thunderjaw are too powerful for a single group to take down, so players naturally come together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That dynamic mix of competition and cooperation — shifting based on the situation — is what makes the Deadlands unique.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is there PvP?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>Right now, we’re currently focused on the core content — PvE elements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What are the aspects of the game that make it an RPG as well as an MMO?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>Steel Frontiers is an MMORPG that combines character progression with constant social interaction. Players start by hunting smaller machines, gradually mastering weapons and tuning gear to become true “machine hunters.” Along the way, you’ll team up with strangers in the field to take down a Slaughterspine, meet new partners in town squares, and build lasting connections that grow into guilds and communities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Different players, each with their own growth stage and hunting style, come together in the Deadlands — sometimes cooperating, sometimes competing — to take on even greater challenges. With every season, new threats emerge and the community evolves. Steel Frontiers isn’t a game you play for just a few sessions — it’s a living world shaped by continuous character growth and an ever-changing community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Can you tell us a bit about the partnership between NCSoft and Guerrilla, and how you’ve worked together on the project?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>Guerrilla and NCSoft have built a collaborative approach that really plays to each studio’s strengths. Guerrilla focuses on maintaining the consistency and integrity of the Horizon IP, providing continuous feedback to ensure asset quality and reviewing new machine designs and story elements to make sure they fit the world and preserve the original visual standards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On our side at NCSoft, we’re focused on creating new gameplay experiences on top of that foundation — leveraging our expertise in cross-platform development for mobile and PC, MMO systems, and designing cooperative combat mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We hold regular conference calls and meet in person at key milestones for deep discussions. Honestly, coordinating across two global studios can be challenging at times, but it’s also incredibly rewarding. We’re learning so much from each other, and I truly believe that combining different perspectives and development cultures is leading to a better game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Have you been able to design new creatures in the Horizon world? Has Guerrilla had to approve them?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>Every new machine design or variation goes through Guerrilla for review and approval. We work closely to ensure everything stays true to the Horizon universe while delivering gameplay that feels unique to Steel Frontiers. It’s an ongoing collaboration to create machines that fit both worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
