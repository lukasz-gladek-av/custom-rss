            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-will-feature-marcus-and-doms-original-voice-actors<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War voice acting veterans John DiMaggio and Carlos Ferro will officially reprise their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago for Gears of War: E-Day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer The Coalition announced the news on Thursday, which also happens to be the 18th anniversary of the launch of the original Gears of War. It‚Äôs big news for longtime fans of the series, who will remember that DiMaggio and Ferro played the two leads in the franchise‚Äôs first three games. An <a href="https://x.com/GearsofWar/status/1854584608223813638" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>image of the two stars standing together</u></a> was shared to studio‚Äôs official X/Twitter account.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We are so back. ü§úü§õ </p><p>On today's 18th anniversary of Gears of War, we're proud to share that John DiMaggio and <a href="https://twitter.com/RealCarlosFerro?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@RealCarlosFerro</a> are reprising their roles as the iconic voices of Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago in Gears of War: E-Day. <a href="https://t.co/x9uaH9R0sR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/x9uaH9R0sR</a></p></div>‚Äî Gears of War (@GearsofWar) <a href="https://twitter.com/GearsofWar/status/1854584608223813638?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War: E-Day is a prequel that takes place awhile before the mainline Gears story got its start. Specifically, it‚Äôs set around Emergence Day, which is known as the day the Locust horde made its way to the surface of Sera to launch its attack on humanity. That means that we definitely won‚Äôt be seeing protagonists like JD Fenix and Kait Diaz from future Gears games, and more importantly, it means that Marcus and Dom get one more game to see how exactly their bond was strengthened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not much of a surprise to hear that DiMaggio and Ferro will re-team for E-Day ‚Äì fans had guessed that the longtime Marcus Fenix voice actor would at least return following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-gears-of-war-game-officially-revealed-at-xbox-showcase-2024"><u>the reveal of an emotional announcement trailer</u></a> earlier this year ‚Äì but it‚Äôs still nice to hear that Dom‚Äôs voice will be returning as well. While Marcus lived on to fight in Gears 4 and 5, his partner‚Äôs journey ended with a heroic sacrifice in Gears of War 3. Many believe the duo‚Äôs relationship and the performances behind them are what helped propel the Gears of War series to success, and now, E-Day is attempting to recapture that gritty, gory magic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Coalition told us earlier this year that Gears of War: E-Day gives the team to return to the series‚Äô roots in more ways than one. One element set to return in the prequel is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-e-day-devs-promise-return-to-horror-from-the-original-games"><u>the horror that the original trilogy is known for</u></a>. Brand Director Nicole Fawcette and Creative Director Matt Searcy spoke to us about their goals in an interview that took place shortly after the game‚Äôs reveal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúFor us, it‚Äôs like a what-if story,‚Äù Searcy said. ‚ÄúWhat if the ground opened up and monsters came out? Yeah, it‚Äôs set on a fictional, other planet, but there are very human reactions and stories we get to tell. To do that, we need to be able to tell a story that feels like a horror story.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War: E-Day is currently without a release date but is expected to come to PC and Xbox Series X | S sometime in the future. In the meantime, you can read about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-is-by-no-means-abandoning-the-stories-told-in-gears-4-and-5-despite-decision-to-do-a-prequel-next"><u>why the prequel doesn‚Äôt meant the end for the story that left off with Gears 5</u></a>.
