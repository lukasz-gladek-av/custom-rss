            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-destined-rivals-launch-ran-into-the-same-old-issues-with-scalpers-shortages-and-outages<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon TCG</a> set, Destined Rivals, has been fully unveiled and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-destined-rivals-preorder-guide-2025">the first pre-orders are already underway</a>. If you've been collecting for a while, it might not surprise you that it's been a fairly chaotic launch window though, with scalpers and store issues already reportedly plaguing the new set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fully unveiled on March 24, Scarlet &amp; Violet - Destined Rivals is set to launch starting on May 30, 2025. A few factors make this a particularly sought-after set. First, it marks the return of Trainer's Pokémon cards. Those old enough to remember <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/1jjbcba/mom_says_we_have_destined_rivals_at_home/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vintage Trainer's Pokémon cards</a>, like Brock's Sandslash or Rocket's Mewtwo, should take a moment to stretch their back and adjust their posture before expressing excitement for this returning archetype.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They're popular ways of tying beloved Trainers into the actual Pokémon cards in cool ways. Additionally, Destined Rivals is also centered around Team Rocket, the bad-team faction of Pokémon's first generation. Suffice to say, much like Prismatic Evolutions and its Eevee-lutions earlier this year, Destined Rivals has the makings of a very popular set.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Destined Rivals Pokémon Center Elite Trainer Box Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, when the pre-orders went live, it should be little surprise that frustration quickly ensued. People trying to get into the Pokémon Center website to buy an Elite Trainer Box, a themed box of packs and other niceties that's a common pick-up for people looking to crack into a set, were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/1jiwtc5/mood/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">left staring in from the outside</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, still unsurprisingly, scalpers immediately hit online auctions like eBay with their ETB pre-orders. Listings of several hundred dollars for the typically $54.99 box were <a href="https://x.com/TCGDannyP/status/1904219026391499227" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seen hitting the site</a>. Again, this is for a confirmed pre-order of the Pokémon Center-specific ETB. Serebii's Joe Merrick summed it up well, <a href="https://x.com/JoeMerrick/status/1904215887965511861" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outlining his own experience</a> waiting for hours in queue to get a Destined Rivals ETB.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I truly hate this," Merrick wrote. "The way almost all Pokemon TCG content has shifted to financial. The way that people just treat it as investment. The way people just want to flip it. It's disgusting. Shame on all involved."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is, sadly, par for the course. The aforementioned <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-company-breaks-silence-on-prismatic-evolution-shortage">Prismatic Evolutions set had shortages</a>, and the Blooming Waters 151 box also came and went fast. It's not uncommon to see notifications and signal-boosts of sets <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-paradox-rift-etbs-in-stock-now-on-amazon-live-new">restocking on various retailers</a>. Already, TPC has said in a FAQ online (<a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/03/pokemon-center-says-more-destined-rivals-product-coming" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">per PokéBeach</a>) that more inventory of the Destined Rivals ETB will become available later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even on top of scalper issues, some purchases are <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemon-destined-rivals-elite-trainer-box-pre-orders-are-being-cancelled/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reporting that their ETB orders are being cancelled</a>. Demand and popularity for the Pokémon TCG seem to be through the roof, but sadly, it also seems to be marring the actual hobby for most trying to just crack some packs or play some matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> offers virtual solutions for the woes of physical scarcity, it's an understandable frustration for those who'd like to simply partake in the hobby. A stroll down your local store's card aisle will, more than likely, paint a clear picture of what it's like trying to pick up some packs right now. It's doubly frustrating when these drops have been exciting ones to see. Hopefully we see some remedies soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ai-limit-review.1144938/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ai-limit-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Like any soulslike fan, I’m quite accustomed to the process of dying over and over again until I’ve mastered a tough section, but playing through AI Limit was the first time I felt that sense of learned repetition before I’d even died at all. That’s because, aside from its anime-inspired art style and a few minor abilities you unlock throughout the story, this by-the-numbers adventure is without question the most milquetoast and unimaginative game I’ve played in the genre. It pit me against boring and meager enemies, laughably wimpy bosses I was largely able to stomp dead without issue, and a story with almost as little to say as its dull protagonist. In fairness, there’s not much especially awful about what AI Limit is doing (apart from its regular crashes and bugs that send you falling through the floor mid boss fight), but there’s almost nothing worthy of praise across this forgettable journey, either.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">AI Limit Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">AI Limit is set in a vague sci-fi universe where society has collapsed due to <em>mysterious circumstances </em>and is now overrun with a bizarre black mud that is both toxic to all life and a delicious meal you eat to regain your health. As an android called a Blader, you were created for the sole purpose of restoring the world back to balance, which you do by killing almost everything you see. You’ll unquestioningly run around the ruins of a civilization that apparently used a book of genre tropes as a blueprint, complete with a sewer that serves as the tutorial and a poison swamp level that’s mandatorily included per the Miyazaki Accords of 2011 – an actual, legally binding statute that’s so evidently real you don’t even need to bother Googling it. The robotic nature of your Blader also provides a convenient excuse for them to never exhibit even mild character traits as they speak in a monotone voice throughout the 30-hour adventure. Having a hazy setting and a forgettable protagonist isn’t exactly unique to this type of game, but if the non-fantasy setting had you hoping this might be one of the ways in which AI Limit breaks that mold: Nah.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The action is largely an impression of better soulslikes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual action is largely an impression of better soulslikes. You’ll split your time between exploring dark and dangerous places, fending off smaller enemies as you work your way to the next bonfire-like checkpoint (in this case, branches sprouting out of the ground), and confronting big, menacing bosses with long health bars and deadly attacks. But that familiar structure underwhelms almost immediately here thanks to a lack of enemy variety, samey and empty levels, and combat that’s overly simplistic and unchallenging. You’ll swing melee weapons several times larger than your body, loose spells that shoot fire, lightning, and more at your opponents, and, of course, dodge roll and parry to keep yourself alive. But while there’s not much unique to be found in AI Limit’s combat, the few new things it tries are mostly good ideas that make me wish it took more risks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest of these mechanics is the Sync Rate bar, which fills up as you do damage and is drained when you use spells or get hurt. The higher your Sync Rate, the more damage you’ll do – but if you take too many hits or use too many spells, you’ll find yourself in a weakened state, unable to use many of your abilities until you land some blows. That rewards cautious play and allows you to cut through boss fights more quickly if you manage to avoid damage while you press the attack. It’s also nice to determine how often you can use your spells by how well you play instead of being limited by a mana meter or something like that. AI Limit even ditches the stamina bar entirely (a genre staple I largely find annoying), letting you attack without fear of running out of steam so long as you are paying attention to your Sync Rate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a pretty neat system where you unlock four special powers that you can freely swap between in the middle of combat, like turning one of your arms into a shield or switching on an ability that lets you make short, quick dashes from place to place. Unfortunately, the first of these abilities that you get allows you to parry enemy attacks, and there’s almost no reason to switch to any of the other powers once you have it since almost everything can be pretty reliably parried, utterly devastating the enemy. So while toggling between these to do some interesting stuff in the middle of combat is a great concept, fights rarely play out that way. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Bosses only very rarely have interesting designs.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll mostly encounter the same handful of aliens that look like leftover costumes from the monsters in Stranger Things and generic robots with identical attack patterns, all of which are easily avoided or parried with little trouble; plus they almost always come at you one at a time. Boss fights are largely straightforward, too, with extremely telegraphed moves that can (once again) be easily parried, stopping those big bads in their tracks as they forget what they were doing for several seconds while you slash away half their health. Bosses also only very rarely have interesting designs, like one that’s just a flying version of the same Stranger Things monsters you’ve already been fighting, and then many are disappointingly recycled, either by almost immediately being reintroduced as common foot soldiers or when they are just straight up reused in another boss fight later on.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Soulslikes Ranked by Difficulty</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unfortunate, because there are times where AI Limit clearly shows promise, like later in the story when the generic, slow-moving bosses very occasionally make way for engaging battles against fellow Bladers. Their movesets are more interesting and challenging, and they have their own Sync Rate bars that must be depleted through attacks and parries in order to reduce the amount of damage they do and open them up to devastating finishing moves. There’s also one or two encounters where AI Limit tries new stuff, like a fight against a giant robot that sits at the end of the room trying to blast you with deadly lasers, and the only way to defeat it is by destroying the electrical equipment powering it as you cut through its minions. But these fights are few and far between, leaving you to slap around the much less interesting, big, ugly, slow moving enemies that make up the bulk of the boss fights most of the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another thing that holds AI Limit back pretty significantly is how buggy it is. I had at least a dozen crashes, got stuck in the environment in ways that caused me to twitch bizarrely, fell right through the floor during boss fights, and once even continuously respawned over and over again at a save point that threw me through the map until I went to the PlayStation dashboard and closed the app. Some of these crashes happened when I was quite deep into exploring an area and far away from a checkpoint, forcing me to start over again through no fault of my own and lose materials in the process. In fact, nearly all of my most frustrating deaths came from straight up glitches, rather than fighting bad guys. That’s not exactly the kind of difficulty I was hoping for.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">AI Limit is a soulslike without any soul, providing 30 mediocre hours of dodge rolling and sword swinging that’s good for little more than filling time. I sliced my way through repetitive goons in unremarkable locations, killed some pushover bosses who were dead before I thought to learn their names, and spent more time recovering from game crashes than learning anything noteworthy about the bland sci-fi setting or the characters within it. The stylish art style, smart Sync Rate system, and swappable abilities are interesting tweaks to the blueprint, but are ultimately too minor to leave much of an impression. If you’re really hurting for more opportunities to scratch that soulslike itch, you could probably do worse than AI Limit, but you could also easily do a whole lot better.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
