And, thanks to tariffs, these now cost slightly more at launch than Nintendo originally announced.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has previously faced criticism for not including Switch 2 Welcome Tour with the console itself. An experience designed as an introduction to Nintendo's new hardware and essentially act as an interactive instruction manual, Welcome Tour would have been a perfect fit to be packed-in with the console — just as Wii Sports was with the Wii.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-backlash-against-10-nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-heats-up-reggie-fils-aim-tweets-the-story-of-wii-sports-pack-in-from-ign-interview-and-everyone-knows-the-point-hes-trying-to-make">Even former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aimé has got stuck into the debate</a>, highlighting the Wii Sports situation from his tenure in charge. At the time, Fils-Aimé disagreed with Nintendo's Japanese bosses who said Wii Sports should have been sold separately (as it still was in Japan). But Fils-Aimé got his way for the U.S. and European markets, and Wii Sports went on to become one of the most successful games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Everyone has to decide if it's worth their $10 to learn about the Switch 2 cartridge slot and watch an HDR fireworks display, and the whole conversation surrounding Welcome Tour has suffered because of Nintendo's irritating decision to charge for it," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-so-is-it-worth-10">IGN wrote earlier this week</a>. It'll be interesting to see whether the added costs further impact customer purchases.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier today, IGN reported on the issue of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-screen-punctures-ruin-launch-day-for-fans-due-to-store-receipts-stapled-into-consoles-box">damaged Switch 2 consoles due to retailers puncturing the console's thin boxes with staples</a>.

Ubisoft gave its Call of duty rival just four months before confirming it would discontinue support. <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Almost half the team lost their jobs</u></a> as Ubisoft made a swath of cuts across its San Francisco and Osaka studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Producer Mark Rubin, who led development fo the game having previously worked on the Call of Duty series at Activision, called it a "sad day" in a lengthy statement posted to <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1930403826378649786" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>X/Twitter</u></a> earlier today. After thanking his co-workers for making a "really fun and terrific game," he announced he's decided to "leave the industry" for good.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"In case everyone doesn’t know, the team behind XDefiant was all let go at the end of last year and I know many people have moved on to other studios, which is great, and I hope that for all of those still looking, that they find something quickly," Rubin wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As for me, I’ve decided to leave the industry and spend more time with my family so unfortunately you won’t be hearing about me making another game. I do care passionately about the shooter space and hope that someone else can pick up the flag that I was trying to carry and make games again that care about the players, treat them with respect and listen to what they have to say."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rubin said the team made "remarkable" progress despite "very little marketing," claiming that despite a lack of advertising, XDefiant "still had the fastest acquisition of players in the first few weeks for a Ubisoft title" just from word-of-mouth promotion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But unfortunately, with little to no marketing, especially after launch, we weren’t acquiring new players after the initial launch," he added, before claiming Ubisoft's in-house game engine "wasn't designed for what [XDefiant] was doing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We had other issues, though, as well that we tried to be transparent about. For one we had crippling tech debt using an engine that wasn’t designed for what we were doing, and we didn’t have the engineering resources to ever correct that. I do personally think that in-house engines are not the valuable investment that they used to be, and they are often doomed to fall behind big engines like Unreal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This tech debt included the dreaded netcode issues that we could just not solve given the architecture we were dealing with," he added. "And so, for many players with solid network connections (in both speed and consistent reliability) the game played well but if your connection had even the smallest amount of inconsistency the engine just couldn’t handle it and you would have a bad experience. Normally, you should be able to weather those bad moments on your network. But this was a major issue with XDefiant."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">XDefiant Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rubin also lamented the lack of resources to make content. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Another issue we had was having the right resources to make content for the game. What we saw at Season 3 wasn’t even enough content in my mind for launch. There were some really cool features coming later in Season 4 or even 5 that would have completed the game in a way that I felt it should have been for launch. I can say everyone’s (devs, HQ leadership, etc.) heart was in the right place, but we just didn’t have the gas to go the distance for a free-to-play game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xdefiant-dev-says-we-have-done-very-little-marketing-so-yes-our-numbers-are-down-denies-support-could-end-after-season-4-if-player-count-doesnt-improve"><u>Ubisoft insisted it wasn't shutting XDefiant down</u></a>, then announced it would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled"><u>shutting XDefiant down just a few weeks later</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-sweeney-says-fortnites-biggest-challenge-is-convincing-people-its-the-everything-game-and-not-just-a-battle-royale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has discussed the future of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, and the developer's continued desire to grow the game from something known primarily as a battle royale into a platform that offers experiences of numerous different genres.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Several years after Fortnite's much-promoted Big Bang event that launched Lego Fortnite, Rock Band developer Harmonix's Festival and Rocket League maker Psyonix's Rocket Racing, Sweeney told IGN at Unreal Fest 2025 that Epic Games' key issue remained the fact that people still think of Fortnite simply as its leading battle royale portion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's our central challenge, to have everybody recognize that Fortnite is the everything game and you can experience anything there," Sweeney said, "and that's going to take time. We're going to have to deliver on a lot of other really awesome genres."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Progress towards that goal has, so far, been steady. Festival continues to attract big name music acts to headline its seasons with new player skins and music drops. Lego Fortnite Odyssey, a survival crafting experience, has a solid player core. But Rocket Racing has largely been retired, and newer shooter-centric modes such as Reload have found more success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During its State of Unreal show this week, Epic Games noted that a third-party experience in Fortnite had momentarily overtaken Epic's own core modes for the first time, something that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago. But Epic Games' own non-shooter modes currently show no signs of replicating this success, with player numbers well below that of the developer's main Battle Royale and Zero Build playlists, let alone Reload or the game's Fortnite OG throwback offering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked by IGN whether engagement for modes such as the musical Fortnite Festival and various Lego Fortnite experiences were where Epic Games wanted them to be, Epic Games executive vice president Sax Persson replied: "I don't think we're ever happy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think the shooter modes have done well," Sweeney added. "I think we've not yet achieved the magic that we've been hoping to achieve with the music gameplay. It's funny, we brought in the Harmonix team, [they] joined Epic, built Rock Band and Guitar Hero in the past, they're an awesome team, and they've been riffing on approaches to that genre and Fortnite. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They've also been bringing in all kinds of music items into Fortnite with Jam Tracks, which have not only a song, but all the beats associated with them, and ability to play them on your instruments."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Music has done extraordinarily well in Fortnite, but ironically, not so much in music games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, despite Fortnite's hugely-popular musical live events generating massive interest and player numbers in the millions, Epic has not yet found a formula that generates regular engagement of the same kind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Music has done extraordinarily well in Fortnite, but ironically, not so much in music games," Sweeney noted, "more just in Battle Royale and elsewhere. Our next step is to figure out music at a large scale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think as Rock Band and Guitar Hero themselves achieved in their day, which was a decade or two decades ago, there's an opportunity for a music game with tens of millions of monthly active users that people just absolutely love and come to every evening or weekend for the coolest concert and competitive gameplay of all sorts."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How about Lego, then, the brand that's perhaps now the most deeply entrenched within the Fortnite ecosystem, and the offering that's most popular of all Epic's non-shooter modes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think Lego is interesting, Persson said. "We are super proud of [the] journey and it has a really dedicated fan base. But is it as big as we would want it to be? No, we would love to have it bigger and figure out a way to get more Lego fans to see that this exists."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fortnite Revealed for Nintendo Switch 2 - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, it sounds like Epic is still facing the issue that Fortnite currently remains a brand associated with being a battle royale more than anything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What's our primary challenge? Our primary challenge is Fortnite is Fortnite, and historically Fortnite was a shooter game," Persson continued. "It is not a shooter game anymore. It is the everything game, and we need to tell that story better than what we've done."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One solution to this will be the forthcoming rollout of improved capabilities for third-party teams working within Fortnite's Unreal Engine-powered editor, UEFN, Sweeney said. Epic currently has a better toolset than other creators, but this will change over time — to the point that Epic's own battle royale seasons will eventually (now in 2026) be made with the same tools as any creator could have access to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we develop our modes, we're working with C++ and the entire Unreal Engine, [while] creators working with the toolset that we built, it's Verse and some APIs," Sweeney noted. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our big task now is to get the two of those development frameworks to converge so that we, Epic, and creators are working in the exact same tools with the exact same capabilities and creators will have way more power at their disposal there, and that's been the thing that we've been working so hard on for the last two years."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I would say we're only successful with Fortnite as an ecosystem"</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But why not just settle with being a brilliantly successful battle royale? For Epic Games, the future of Fortnite as a continued experience — and source of enormous income for the company — rests on its continued evolution and ongoing cultural relevance, amid the ever-changing landscape of popular video game tastes and genres.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I would say we're only successful with Fortnite as an ecosystem," Sweeney concluded. "If somebody else actually beats us at our game, and builds something that's bigger and cooler and better than battle royale... I think there's a high probability of that happening. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you look at the shooter genre, it evolved with new game types coming out over time based on what was possible with the current technology," he added, noting the evolution of shooters from simple games of Deathmatch to modes with larger player counts and vehicles. "Battle Royale just happens to be the best shooter genre yet invented — and thanks to both the Japanese movie makers and [PUBG creator] Brendan Green for discovering the magic there. But it's definitely not the last. There'll be more and it'll get even better and new technologies are going to make things that are currently impossible, possible, and I think that's going to unleash unexpected surprises and creativity."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a busy week for Epic Games, which has been talking about the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ai-prompts-will-soon-let-a-10-person-team-build-a-game-like-breath-of-the-wild-where-the-ai-is-doing-all-the-dialogue-and-you-just-write-character-synopsis-tim-sweeney-predicts">future of AI in its Unreal Engine and in Fortnite</a> following the recent release of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-has-only-been-live-for-an-hour-and-already-epic-has-patched-out-him-saying-fk">very chatty AI-powered Darth Vader</a>.

I'm pretty sure it's him."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aged 30, the Irish actor is just a few years older than the 26-year-old version of Bond he looks set to portray in the upcoming game — and, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy">if IO Interactive gets its way, several sequels</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if Gibson looks familiar to you too, well, the actor already has a swathe of TV and film roles under his belt, including appearances in Shadow and Bone, The Tudors, and The OA. But it's his role as a younger version of Dexter Morgan in prequel series Dexter: Original Sin for which he's most famous.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/05/gettyimages-632417032-1749114309513.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Patrick Gibson.

Gibson also, for now, appears to keeping schtum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A press release issued alongside Gibson's apparent debut in 007 First Light's trailer describes the game as as globe-trotting story-driven action-adventure game where you can choose how to navigate various challenges — either with brute force or 007's trademark charm. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer showed Bond cracking a couple of deadpan jokes as he got himself out of (and into) trouble. Gibson's acting chops as the antihero Dexter look set to be put to good use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">007 First Light is due to launch at some point in 2026 for Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-controller-patent-points-to-sequel-for-million-selling-game-fans-believe<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A fresh patent for a new Nintendo game controller has set tongues wagging that a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ring-fit-adventure">Ring Fit Adventure</a> sequel is on the way for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.tmdn.org/tmdsview-web/#/dsview/detail/EM700000015103981-0002" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patent</a>, dug up by the appropriately-named <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lqqsrllafc2x" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Patents Watch</a>, was filed at the end of May 2025 and published online publicly this week — albeit with all of its images currently redacted. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is named as the owner of the patent, which is listed as being for "video game controllers (accessories)." Most importantly, Nintendo employee Fumiyoshi Suetake is mentioned as the controller's specific designer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Suetake was a key figure in the development of the original Ring Fit Adventure, which launched in 2019 for Nintendo Switch and has now sold more than 15 million copies. The game is packaged with a pilates ring-style accessory, which players squash and stretch while exercising. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The appearance of Suetake's name on the patent is a big clue that the currently unannounced controller may be a new Ring Fit accessory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Nintendo Patents Watch pointed out that Nintendo recently extended the patent on its original Ring Fit Adventure controller, suggesting the company still wanted ongoing legal protection for a product that was already available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, manufacturing giant Foxconn, a long-time Nintendo partner, has previously noted it is helping to develop new "force sensing technology" for a gaming firm, and has published a diagram showing what looks to be an updated Ring Fit controller.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/04/bafkreidkbktitwbjvzjyseyohlrddpxn7m3xkw6suig4pqhscjkqrpn5bq-1749033044234.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Foxconn diagram showing a controller, left, similar to the Ring Fit Adventure device.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this points to a new Ring Fit Adventure game on the way, with a Switch 2 launch seemingly likely. If nothing else, it'd make sense that Nintendo wanted a sequel to such a successful game — even if sales of the original Ring Fit Adventure were fuelled by gym-hungry owners stuck at home in 2020, exercising in front of their TV.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ring Fit Adventure offers an inventive fitness RPG that doesn’t quite have all the moves," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/17/ring-fit-adventure-for-nintendo-switch-review">Ring Fit Adventure review</a>, which praised the game's "fun and challenging blend of exercise and RPG mechanics."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Switch 2 is out now and we have plenty to help get you started. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-updates-for-mario-zelda-pokmon-switch-games-now-live-including-unavailable-super-mario-3d-all-stars-here-are-all-the-patch-notes">From ARMS to Zelda, here are all of the new updates to Switch 1 games</a>, and here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game-you-can-buy-right-now">every Nintendo Switch 2 launch game you can buy right now</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
