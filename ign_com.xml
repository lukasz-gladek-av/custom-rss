            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Robo-Link, activate?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Nintendo Partner Direct, we got a new trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. While most of the trailer was straightforward, it ended on a cryptic tease that has Zelda fans running with speculation as to what the scene could mean for the game's roster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end of the trailer shows a chamber deep inside a cavern where what appears to be one of the Constructs from Tears of the Kingdom is being assembled and activated. The Constructs themselves are nothing new - they're all over the place in Tears of the Kingdom, and we know they were created by Mineru during the events of Age of Imprisonment, so it makes sense we'd see them in the game. What's interesting about this one is that it appears to be roughly human-shaped and -sized, whereas none of the Constructs we've met before (including Mineru's own Construct) were quite that proportioned.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why are fans excited about this? Well, a lot of folks think this means <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeLink/comments/1me38a5/how_are_we_feeling_about_construct_link_x_zelda/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we're getting some sort of Robo-Link playable in Age of Imprisonment</a>. The game takes place in the far, far distant past, thousands of years before the main events of Tears of the Kingdom, and in the time period that Zelda is transported to at the start of that game. It covers the events of the Imprisoning War as Zelda experienced it during her time in that era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As such, chronologically, it doesn't make any sense that Link would be playable in Age of Imprisonment. There was no Link in that era, after all. That said, it also seems baffling that a Legend of Zelda game, even a spin-off, could exist without Link involved. This is why a lot of fans have been speculating that Link will find some way to turn up, whether that's through alternate timeline shenanigans (see: Age of Calamity) or some other method. And this teaser offers one possibility for this hoped-for Linkening: maybe Link somehow gets to embody one of Mineru's constructs made in his likeness, so he can fight alongside the others of that era.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">nintendo you know i dont play about fi please dont play with me <a href="https://t.co/Uj0QOJQ9aj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Uj0QOJQ9aj</a></p>— ava (@zeldevil) <a href="https://twitter.com/zeldevil/status/1950913028670787672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That said, there's one other detail that has fans thinking this is going in a different direction. If you listen back to the ending teaser, there's a bit of music that plays as the scene transitions to the Construct. If you're a Skyward Sword fan, you'll recognize it as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV1Efuh-aus" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fi's Theme</a>. The presence of this little chime has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1me1h85/aoi_new_age_of_imprisonment_trailer_in_nintendo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some suspecting that this won't be a Robo Link</a>, but actually a way for Fi to finally reappear in a Zelda game after being (understandably) absent for so long. Some are suggesting this could be possible given that Zelda obtains the broken Master Sword at the start of her time in the ancient era. Given that Fi dwells within the sword, what if they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1me2vii/totk_rise_up_because_we_are_so_back/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">used its fragments to give her a body to fight with</a>? Anything's possible!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, that means it's also possible this thing is none of the above and we're in for some sort of weird twist surprise when the game comes out. Age of Calamity, after all, wasn't quiiiite what we thought it was by the endgame, so it's likely Age of Imprisonment also has some tricks up its sleeve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We unfortunately still don't have a firm release date for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment but know it's coming to Nintendo Switch 2 sometime this winter. You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at today's Nintendo Partner Direct right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> fans tuning in were left disappointed by yet another video game showcase passing with no further word of Team Cherry's highly-anticipated, long-awaited sequel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And to be fair to the fans, there was cause to think today might finally bring Silksong's much-desired release date. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-makes-brief-appearance-during-nintendo-switch-2-direct-to-secure-2025-release-window">Nintendo Direct earlier this year confirmed the game would arrive in 2025</a>, raising hopes of a fresh appearance today.

Reaction to the Nintendo Direct on the Hollow Knight and Silksong subreddits has, perhaps to be expected, not been positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The top thread currently on the Silksong <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1me1j9k/aaahahahahahahah/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> is a meme of a cat laughing open-mouthed, pointing at the screen. "It's never been so over", "The cycle of pain", "Silksong isn't real" read a selection of the comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've genuinely lost so much hype for this game," wrote reddit user YeetHead10. "I was so excited last year but now I've just moved on."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"No you havent," replied DirtySlutMuffin. "You're here complaining."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"At least this is consistent in my life," CringeNaeNaeBaby2 said, referring to the constant disappointment around Silksong they faced. "You know when they go to jail, spend years trying to get out, then beg to be readmitted after being freed? I'm gonna beg for Silksong to be unreleased. I need the longing, the spite keeps me alive. I'm gonna drop dead when Silksong comes out."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans simply seem upset at their own frustration, though a few have suggested Silksong developer Team Cherry should be doing more to set expecations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I feel like people would be taking it better if Team Cherry themselves gave more frequent updates," wrote reddit user ChocoGoodness, "instead of letting us wait for Nintendo or Xbox or whatever to announce it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, all we know of Silksong's arrival is that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-developer-responds-to-release-date-confusion-promises-launch-before-holiday-not-tied-to-xbox-handheld-arrival">will launch before Christmas 2025, and not be tied to the release of the ROG Ally X handheld</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For everything that <em>was </em>shown today, here's our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-everything-announced">roundup of the Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase presentation in full</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">At Gen Con 2025, Disney Lorcana celebrated its two-year anniversary in a big way by revealing A Goofy Movie and Iconic Mickey and Minnie cards headed to the Fabled expansion, details on Whispers in the Well, Winterspell, and Toy Story cards, and even a brand-new set of Disney Lorcana puzzles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a lot to look forward to in the ever-expanding world of Disney Lorcana, and you can check out all the latest news and cards below!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fabled's Iconic Mickey and Minnie Cards Are the Stars of This Expansion Alongside A Goofy Movie</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana - Fabled</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fabled is set to be released at local card shops on August 25 and everywhere else on September 5, and one of the biggest new additions it brings to Disney Lorcana is Iconic cards. These are even rarer than Enchanted and feature full alternate artwork, unique foil pattern, and foil hot-stamped text and stats. Kicking off this new rarity will be Minnie Mouse - Sweetheart Princess and Mickey Mouse - Brave Little Prince.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These cards not only look great, but they also complete a picture when placed together. Furthermore, Minnie's Royal Favor adds Support to any Mickey Mouse cards, meaning their love for each other will also help you in-game!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another new rarity being added with Fabled will be Epic, which are rarer than Legendary but more common than Enchanted, and one of these new cards will be A Goofy Movie's Stand Out. A Goofy Movie's arrival in Lorcana was long-requested, and Stand Out will celebrate this moment alongside Powerline - World's Greatest Rock Star and I2I.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dumbo is also getting some love in the new Fabled set, as Dumbo - The Flying Elephant, and Timothy T. Mouse - Flight Instructor will be just two of the card players that will be able to seek out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There will also be a handful of promo cards to look out for in Fabled, including Alice - Accidentally Adrift (Buy a Box Promo), Cursed Merfolk - Usula's Handiwork (Weekly Play Promo), Sisu - Daring Visitor (Weekly Play Promo), Strength of Raging Fire (Weekly Play Promo), and The Queen - Conceited Ruler (Pre-Release Promo).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, Maleficent in her dragon form will be featured as Fabled's Set Championship, meaning there will be cards and play mats available to those who can win at tournaments held throughout the year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Collection Starter Set and Elsa Gift Box Are Made for Collectors and Newcomers</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana Collection Starter Set and Elsa Gift Set</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For those looking for even more ways to celebrate their love of Disney Lorcana or jump in for the first time, the Collection Starter Set and Elsa Gift Box will be worth a look when they launch on October 3, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Collection Starter Set will cost $29.99 and will include a 4-pocket card portfolio featuring Mickey Mouse - Brave Little Tailor artwork, which had previously only been used at Disney Lorcana Challenge. There will also be a "Glimmer Foil" Tinker Bell - Giant Fairy promo card, four Fabled booster packs, and a Collector's Guide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elsa Gift Box, on the other hand, will also cost $29.99, and it will come with five Booster packs, one "Glimmer Foil" Elsa - The Fifth Spirit promo card, one storage box, and three punch-out card dividers.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Whispers in the Well Will Feature Zootopia's Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana - Whispers in the Well</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whispers in the Well is the next set after Fabled and will have its pre-release on November 7 and official release on November 14. For Disney Lorcana lore hunters, this set will introduce Whispers, which are partially-formed Glimmers that we'll encounter in the "depths of the Great illuminary." To find these Whispers, certain detective Glimmers like Mickey Mouse, Judy Hopps, and Nick Wilde will need to lend their expertise to the cause.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We were given a look at a few of the Zootopia cards that will be part of Whispers in the Well, including Judy Hopps - Uncovering Clues, Nick WIlde - Persistent Investigator, and Putting It All Together. The Deck and Booster Pack art was also revealed, and they feature such characters as Daisy, Demona, Gaston, Simba, Megara, Judy Hopps, and Robin Hood.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winterspell Promises 'Flurries of Fun' With Stitch, Angel, and More</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/stitch-1753964680733.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Q1 2026, Disney Lorcana will be releasing Winterspell, a new expansion that promises "Flurries of Fun." We don't know too much about this set yet, but the art you can see above features Stitch and Angel, and they appear to be in a tropical setting that is covered in snow! </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Toy Story to Arrive in Disney Lorcana in Q2 2026</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As one final surprise, the team at Disney Lorcana revealed Toy Story characters will be joining the TCG in Q2 2026. The only info we have is from a piece of artwork that features both Woody and Buzz on a seemingly alien planet. More details will be shared in the future.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Disney Lorcana Puzzles From Ravensburger Feature Original Art from the TCG</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana Puzzles from Ravensburger</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney Lorcana is venturing into the world of puzzles as it will be presenting six 1,000-piece puzzles from Ravensburger - one for each Ink color, that will feature original art from the TCG and each will even come with a Disney Mickey Mouse - True Friend promo card.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>[Editor's Note: Minor spoilers for Dead Reset ahead.]</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cole Mason has a problem. He’s woken up in a dank cellar of a room, surrounded by people he doesn’t know and under circumstances he doesn't recall. They are all very unpleasant and really need him to perform a high-stakes surgery as soon as possible under threat of a swift execution at the hands of extra-ornery security guard named Slade. I was given a few choices upfront, mostly to attempt to resist being forced to cooperate. Early attempts to run and refuse are met with pretty convincing pushback, so Cole ultimately plays ball and helps them with the surgery. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, that's when things get weird. The patient is revealed to have a pretty dramatic, pulsating tumor in her abdomen, and after Cole’s understandable recoil of disgust, he gets to cutting. Pulling back the skin reveals a sort of living tumor that she certainly wasn’t born with. Before he can attempt to extract it, though, Cole is grabbed by one of its tentacles, and we’re given a choice as to how to deal with it: hack away at the rubbery limb or attempt to calm down and let it ease up on its own. It doesn’t really matter which choice you make, as both moves have a similar outcome of the tumor bursting from the patient’s body, revealing its mangled alien form of meat and mouth, and killing everyone in the room in gruesome fashion.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dead Reset Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then things get really weird, as Cole wakes up on the floor he started on, startled by the fact that not only is he not dead, but he’s the only person who remembers the past several minutes of their lives together. What ensues is a tense, quirky, and clever horror sci-fi experience that does a great job at building suspense with  limited set and effects budgets, and a cast of actors taking the Russian Doll meets Alien premise seriously, despite being a hard sell on paper.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Dead Reset’s commitment to real actors with real props on real sets is such a refreshing sight that feels novel both in video games and in film in general in 2025.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You could argue that horror games that are more like interactive films peaked in quality with 2015’s Until Dawn, but there’s been a steady drip of them hitting market places thanks almost entirely to developer Supermassive Games and the work they’ve done since Until Dawn with The Dark Pictures anthology and other little releases here and there. And while those virtual slash fests are fun and give artists some flexibility on how they can render a gnarly monster or a brutal death of some unfortunate camper by its hands, Dead Reset’s commitment to real actors with real props on real sets is such a refreshing sight that feels novel both in video games and in film in general in 2025. Does every prop live up to Tom Sevini’s best? Probably not. But the SyFy tv show chic and the audacity to do it at all is what scored the most points for me so far.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The choice-making parts of these sorts of games can be dubious, though. It’s often tough to know in the moment if a choice you’re making would change the outcome of a scenario, or if it's all an elaborate set of smoke and mirrors to build tension in the present at the expense of replayability in the future. Developer Dark Rift Horror signals that there are multiple endings, each wildly different from one another, and the one-hour demo of the first chapter is absolutely not enough to determine if that's true or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The death-loop gimmick does a lot of work to help every present moment feel important, though. Every respawn, Cole (and I) got a little smarter based on our last set of attempts and failures that would sometimes reveal just a smidge more new information to be exploited next time. Cole can’t delay the surgery because the creature will let itself out rather explosively. Attempting to steal Slade’s gun and force your way out of the room reveals that it's got a security measure that Cole will certainly regret triggering if he tries to use it. Magson, the older leader of this gang of misfits, made this and other modifications to the room that essentially locked everyone in it without their knowledge. The patient’s name is Amanda, and Fearne, another crew member in the room, has some sort of relationship with her. These tidbits add up to become a laundry list of facts that helps Cole convince the crew that he’s in a sort of Groundhog Day scenario that maybe they can help him navigate in a way that doesn’t involve all of them getting murdered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these seemed pretty guided in that I could make different choices, but there isn’t much room to interpret that any of the smaller details would happen differently, or even in a different order. But all of this gets us to the surgery itself, which was the first glimpse of how the paths could branch into different outcomes further down the line. This is a bit of a spoiler, but going into a bit of detail about how this sequence plays out might help illustrate the ways in which your choices do and don’t matter. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The patient is revealed to have a pretty dramatic, pulsating tumor in her abdomen, and after your understandable recoil of disgust, you get to cutting.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You can guide Cole through the extraction of the creature in a couple of ways, specifically choosing how to keep it sedated long enough to detach it from Amanda without killing them both. You can use drugs to keep the patient and the creature’s vitals low but steady, or you can stop Amanda’s heart, which would also stop the creature’s temporarily. Ultimately, I wasn’t able to find (and don’t believe there is) a way to save Amanda during this operation, but how you choose to attempt it will either ingratiate you with Fearne or draw some light praise from Slade. It seemed pretty clear here that this was the beginning of a sort of trust system that could hold some consequences down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things in Dead Reset get somehow even weirder after this, but I think it’s best to avoid those spoilers, as they’re pretty key to what’s going on and why, but the suspense is thick and intrigue is high during its entire runtime. Real bodies on real sets with real stunts and props is a philosophy sorely missed in film these days, so it's ironic that a video game is attempting to bring that feeling back. The game-ness of it all, specifically necessity and weight of your limited inputs, is still pretty dubious, with little sense of how your actions affect the story in front of you. But if you’re willing to approach this like you would a movie, being present and acting in the now without thinking too much about finding branching paths for your next playthrough, I think you can have a lot of gore-drenched fun when Dead Reset hits Steam in September.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-reset-combines-alien-with-russian-doll-type-choice-driven-gameplay]]></content:encoded>
