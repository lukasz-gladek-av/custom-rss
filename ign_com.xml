            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-may-27-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s deals are stacked with a mix of stuff I’d genuinely grab for myself, so let me break it down. If you’re like me and hate carrying around a million cables, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxev8?object_uuid=0b2ef7a8-aa14-465f-9d89-9bb3a884628a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>INIU 45W Power Bank</strong></a> is a game-changer. It’s slim, charges fast, and has a built-in USB-C cable so you can leave the tangled mess at home. At $26.99, it’s a solid pickup. On the other hand, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7LvR?object_uuid=0b2ef7a8-aa14-465f-9d89-9bb3a884628a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>UGREEN USB-C to USB Adapter 4 Pack</strong></a> is perfect for those moments when you need to plug a USB-A gadget into your laptop or phone—super handy and only $6.98. For the cable chaos in my workspace and garage, I’m eyeing the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKgY6j?object_uuid=0b2ef7a8-aa14-465f-9d89-9bb3a884628a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>HAVE ME TD Cable Zip Ties (400-Pack)</strong></a> at $3.99. It’s just a simple fix for a mess I know I’ve been ignoring. And if you’re a PC gamer who’s tired of blurry upscaling and sketchy frame generation on gaming handhelds, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GZ6q?object_uuid=0b2ef7a8-aa14-465f-9d89-9bb3a884628a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Lossless Scaling</strong></a> is a neat little program that smooths things out.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now for the fun stuff. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAJbm?object_uuid=0b2ef7a8-aa14-465f-9d89-9bb3a884628a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Fallout Pip-Boy Die-Cast Replica</strong></a> is just ridiculously cool. It’s a 1:1 replica straight from the TV show, complete with a screen that runs Fallout animations, an FM radio, and a working clock. At $199.99, it’s a bit of a splurge, but man, if you’re a fan, it’s the kind of thing that makes you stop and stare every time you walk past it. Before I break these deals down, let's take a look at what Magic: The Gathering and Pokémon TCG wins i've found this morning:</p><p id="mtg-final-fantasy-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG FInal Fantasy Bundle">MTG Final Fantasy Bundle Walmart Preorder</h2></p><div catalogid="840f5339-ee1a-4f4f-9923-f0b63792a061" id="221751"><div id="221751" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MTG FInal Fantasy Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the only preorder I can find from a big box retailer this morning, and it's actually cheaper than the market value over on TCG Player right now. Imagine that? If you're planning on picking up Final Fantasy at launch, this is a no-brainer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Final Fantasy TCG Player Preorders</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">MTG: Final Fantasy</a> is set to be the biggest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-your-first-look-at-over-a-dozen-new-cards-from-magic-the-gatherings-upcoming-final-fantasy-set">Magic: The Gathering</a> set ever, which is a shock to absolutley no-one. Preorders are drying up at retail, but there's plenty of choice available on TCG Player right now. I've found all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-preorder-restock-latest-amazon">preorders</a> listed so far (including prerelease boxes) alongside massive cases on booster displays. Don't sleep on these preorders, MTG FF is going to fly off the shelves on release.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Final Fantasy Single Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The single card market for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-spoiler-amano-matsuda">MTG Final Fantasy</a> is flying right now, so I've included over 40 of (in my opinion) the most popular Final Fantasy cards collectors and players will be chasing once packs start getting ripped. Don't want to spend money on boosters and hope? Secure your chase cards for release day instead.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Marvel's Spider-Man Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst there's only the Play Booster Box and Scene Bundle for MTG: Marvel's Spider-Man live on Amazon right now, TCG Player has every sealed product that will hit the market on launch day. I've even found some pricing on cases of sealed product for those looking to rip open a tonne of boosters, so get on it before the market value on these products shoot up.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Spider-Man Single Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunatley there's no listings for Spider-Man single cards right now considering we're a few months out from release, but I've managed to round up the listings for cards currently sitting on TCG Player waiting for presale allocations, so keep your eyes peeled.</p><p id="slashing-legends-tin"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Slashing Legends Tin"> Slashing Legends Tin In Stock At Walmart</h2></p><div catalogid="840f5339-ee1a-4f4f-9923-f0b63792a061" id="221750"><div id="221750" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Slashing Legends Tin</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Featuring a new promo, Journey Together and Surging Sparks boosters alongside Obsidian Flames and Paradox Rift, this is arguably one of the best Pokémon TCG tins people can buy for retail value right now. Snap it up before the bots do!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG Stock Update</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Long story short; things are looking bleak at retail for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon TCG</a> right now. Almost everything is way above MSRP and seems to becoming the new normal for big box retailers. I could write a whole article and why this is and what should be done to stop this practice, but here we are. If you have your heart set on opening booster packs, have at it, but you might want to check out the sections below to save money.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TCG Player Has The Same Products For Less</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">TCG Player and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pokémon TCG</a> secondary collectors market is significantly cheaper than big box retailers at the time of writing. This will likely be the case unless you can secure preorders on new sets such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-destined-rivals-expansion-unboxing#:~:text=Destined%20Rivals%20is%20the%20kind,building%20it%20around%20a%20character.">Destined Rivals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed">Black Bolt and White Flare</a>. Make no mistake products are still over MSRP, but If small businesses can undercut large retailers on TCG Player, there's something fundamentally broken in the supplier-distributor-retail chain.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">This Weeks Pokémon TCG Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Single <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-destined-rivals-expansion-unboxing">Pokémon TCG</a> market on the other hand is going through a grand reset right now, which is down to a few factors. The crypto bro mentally to reselling products is dying down a little and more product is becoming available thanks to reprints. We're not out of the woods yet by any means, but this weeks <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-may-19">Crashers and Climbers</a> show recent cards going down in price and cards from the X and Y era shooting up in value. We're 100% moving in the right direction.</p><p id="lossless-scaling"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lossless Scaling">Lossless Scaling</h2></p><div catalogid="840f5339-ee1a-4f4f-9923-f0b63792a061" id="221755"><div id="221755" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lossless Scaling</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GZ6q?object_uuid=0b2ef7a8-aa14-465f-9d89-9bb3a884628a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Lossless Scaling</strong></a> is a game changer for PC players who want to upscale games or generate extra frames without sacrificing quality.
