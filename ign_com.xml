That's why we're left with so many questions about Eve's world, including an official explanation as to why she requires a costume change so often.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While it seems Shift Up considered retrospectively adding in cutscenes to better explain the story, Kim was concerned that may "clash" with what players know and understand of the game thus far. Consequently, it looks like we can expect a "sufficiently rich narrative" when it comes to the sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We probably shouldn't expect a follow-up anytime soon, however; right now, the whole team is reportedly dedicated to the PC port. Kim did say Shift Up would "do our best" to get it out by 2027, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PC version of Stellar Blade <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-pc-release-date-features-new-boss-fight-and-25-new-outfits-revealed-by-leaked-sony-trailer"><u>only launched on June 11</u></a>, but it's already Sony's biggest single-player Steam launch ever. Right now, the concurrent player peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=24h" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>is over 192,000</u></a>.

In fact, the only Sony-published game to have a higher concurrent record than Stellar Blade is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a>, which is, of course, a multiplayer game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-review"><u>IGN's Stellar Blade review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: "Stellar Blade is great in all of the most important ways for an action game, but dull characters, a lackluster story, and several frustrating elements of its RPG mechanics prevent it from soaring along with the best of the genre."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PC-specific features include AI upscaling via Nvidia DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 3, an unlocked framerate, Japanese and Chinese voiceover, ultrawide display support, higher resolution environment textures, and DualSense support for haptic feedback and trigger effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Chief among them is the instant respawn timer in the PvP areas ("even when you win a long winded battle the losing team will just re-spawn instantly in the local area").</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, other players have reported different issues with Dune: Awakening's endgame, although Bylos is yet to directly respond to those complaints. "End game is a total mess," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lcgaqq/end_game_is_a_total_mess/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>lamented</u></a> redditor Darqsat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's nothing else in [Deep Desert] to attract PvE players, so DD usually empty and consists only crazy PvP tryhards. Officially, PvE ends in T5 with Duraluminium. And either they try different builds, or base-building, or they just leave the game. Nothing motivates them to go deep into desert. No legendary storyline quests, no certain PvE items like vehicle parts, or base parts, nothing."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The complaints about Dune: Awakening's endgame come as the survival MMO <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>hit a new high over the weekend of 189,333 players</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dune: Awakening has enjoyed a superb launch, with a 'very positive' user review rating on Steam.
