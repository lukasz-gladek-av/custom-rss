A third, meanwhile, kept watch at the door. "It was a free event and then three armed men just came in and brandished guns in [customers'] faces," store owner Courtney Chin said. The shop has since employed a security guard.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/16/screenshot-2026-01-16-170406-1768584036372.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A Pokémon card thief brandishes a gun during the latest store raid.

"I've seen videos where the robbers will tunnel in through the walls, or through the ceiling. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-thieves-steal-cards-worth-100000-in-latest-californian-store-heist">$100,000 worth of stock was also swiped from a store in Burbank</a> — although that was overnight. At the time, Californian cops said they suspected the raid was linked to "half a dozen" similar thefts within the southern half of the state in recent weeks. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thieves-caught-on-camera-stealing-35000-pokmon-cards-get-mocked-by-store-staff">Numerous</a> other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thieves-allegedly-steal-315000-worth-of-pokmon-and-other-trading-cards-in-targeted-attack">examples</a> have also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thieves-allegedly-steal-70000-worth-of-pokmon-cards-after-asking-store-staff-which-were-valuable">occured</a> nationwide over the past 12 months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We can't let a few bad apples like this ruin the hobby for everyone else," Chin concluded.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> Update 1.1.3.5 patch notes are here as EA and Battlefield Studios work to balance jet gameplay and melee combat amid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-to-february-as-ea-tackles-community-feedback-with-an-extended-season-1">the recently delayed Season 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-game-update-1-1-3-5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full breakdown</a> of what is a smaller update for the troubled FPS installment was published on its official website today. BF Studios describes the update, which has a January 20 release date and serves as the first update Battlefield 6 has seen in a month and a half, as “a smaller set of focused improvements aimed at polish and consistency.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, patch 1.1.3.5 delivers a set of improvements, gameplay tweaks, and balance changes fans have anticipated since launch arrived in October. Jet combat will feel quite different going into the extended Season 1, with cannon damage against other flying vehicles significantly reduced, requiring “approximately 40% more hits” to destroy targets. There’s currently no sign of the previously mentioned dedicated air radar, which was promised to arrive after Season 1 in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios has had a jet balance pass in its sights for some time, but the January 20 update for Battlefield 6 is also said to come with what sounds like a pretty wide-ranging update for melee combat. As players have complained of inconsistent knife and sledgehammer attacks, patch 1.1.3.5 aims to improve responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for those who like to get up close and personal. Another set of smaller changes targets the Assault Ladder, which should behave, well, more like a ladder going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 Season 1 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-1110-now-live-on-all-platforms-ahead-of-season-1-and-battle-pass-progression-later-today">launched</a> October 28 and was scheduled to bring its REDSEC offshoot, maps, weapons, modes, and more to the experience through early-to-mid January. As the three-part debut season came to an end, players were left wondering how Season 2 might reinvigorate an experience that was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/losing-steam-3-months-after-launch-its-time-for-a-check-in-with-battlefield-6-and-its-community">steadily falling out of favor with fans</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn’t until January 13, much later than many expected, that BF Studios was finally ready to speak on Season 2, but the news update wasn’t exactly the one many were expecting. Instead of a roadmap, the team announced that Season 2 had been delayed to February 17, with its contents to be detailed at a later date. In its place, Season 1 will roll on, with smaller updates and bonuses to be delivered during the downtime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Battlefield 6 update 1.1.3.5 will keep the ball rolling, even if it’s just a slight nudge toward the next major content drop. In other news, it was announced this morning that The Division lead Julian Gerighty had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-week-after-saying-the-division-3-was-shaping-up-to-be-a-monster-franchise-boss-julian-gerighty-leaves-ubisoft-for-battlefield-developer-dice">left Ubisoft and to join BF Studios developer DICE</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, you can read the full 1.1.3.5 patch notes below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Update 1.1.3.5 Patch Notes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With Update 1.1.3.5, we’re delivering a smaller set of focused improvements aimed at polish and consistency across Battlefield 6.
