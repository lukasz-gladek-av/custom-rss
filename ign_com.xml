"I personally thought it was a really strong game. I thought it was just BioWare being more BioWare. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I also think a lot of people kind of wanted to see it fail, or wanted to see [BioWare] fail, either because they're just really bad people on the internet — of which there are unfortunately many, as we have discovered."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At launch, The Veilguard was review-bombed online. Criticism of the game being "woke" centred on its inclusion of a non-binary companion character, and the ability for the player to choose to be transgender. On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>, Dragon Age: The Veilguard now sits with a 'Mixed' player respose, with user-defined tags for the game describing it under "LGBTQ+" and "politics" labels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"People were attacking the game before it was released," Wilton Regan continued. "It's ridiculous. How can you judge a game, a book, a film, a TV show before it's actually released? You can't. It's an idiotic stance to take."</p><div id="rank-the-best-dragon-age-veilguard-companions" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank the Best Dragon Age Veilguard Companions</h3><h3>Rank the Best Dragon Age Veilguard Companions</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In January, publisher EA said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-15-million-players-in-first-two-months-ea-expected-3-million">Dragon Age: The Veilguard had "underperformed" versus its expectations by around 50%</a>, just days after the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-reportedly-exits-bioware">game's director Corrine Busche confirmed she was leaving</a> the company.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/confirmed-mortal-kombat-1-wont-get-any-more-dlc-characters-or-story-chapters-as-netherrealm-needs-to-shift-focus-to-the-next-project<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. has confirmed what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> fans feared after the recent launch of the Definitive Edition: no new DLC characters or story chapters will be released for the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat 1 has sold 5 million copies, with the franchise now up to 100 million. Mortal Kombat 11 became the best-selling game in the franchise by passing Mortal Kombat X's nearly 11 million units sold worldwide soon after launch. By 2022, Mortal Kombat 11 had sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. Clearly, Mortal Kombat 1 has underperformed compared to previous games in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020816879206810" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a> on the official Mortal Kombat social media account, Warner Bros. acknowledged the disappointment the news will cause players, "but our team at NetherRealm needs to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. failed to say what this new project is, but current speculation points to Injustice 3, a continuation of NetherRealm’s DC fighting game series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement in full:</p><blockquote>We are hearing players’ requests for continued game support of Mortal Kombat 1, and, while we will continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes, there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released from this point on.</blockquote><blockquote>We understand this will be disappointing for fans, but our team at NetherRealm needs to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">March 2025's release of the T-1000 guest character, which came a year-and-a-half after the release of Mortal Kombat 1 itself, now goes down as the game’s final major content drop. For context, in July 2021, NetherRealm announced it had started work on its next project (Mortal Kombat 1) and, as a result, there would be no further DLC for Mortal Kombat 11. That announcement came two years and three months after the release of the game. Today’s announcement comes one year and eight months after the release of Mortal Kombat 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are already bringing up prior comments from NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon, who had promised fans years of support. Indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago"><u>many are now pointing to a September 2024 tweet from Boon</u></a>, who at the time moved to reassure fans already concerned that the studio had moved onto its next game by saying: “NetherRealm is still fully committed to supporting Mortal Kombat 1 for a long time to come.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-mortal-kombat-1-community-is-working-together-to-try-to-figure-out-how-to-fight-floyd-but-the-exact-process-remains-a-mystery-for-now"><u>Mortal Kombat 1 enjoyed something of a resurgence in January with the secret fight with Floyd</u></a>, the pink ninja developer Boon had been teasing for years. That sparked a fun community-wide effort that breathed new life into the game. But that was a rare bright spot for what has, overall, been a disappointing release for many core Mortal Kombat fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What now for Mortal Kombat? Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated that it still believes the gory fighting game franchise has a future. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady"><u>the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which was Mortal Kombat</u></a>. Movie adaptation Mortal Kombat 2 is due out later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/parks-2nd-edition-board-game-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/parks-2nd-edition-board-game-review.1197825/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/parks-2nd-edition-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When the original Parks released in 2019, it quickly became a modern classic, thanks in large part to its gorgeous artwork celebrating the U.S. National Parks. See our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/parks-board-game-review">review</a> for details on that first edition. But Keymaster Games didn’t just slap a fresh coat of paint on the 2nd Edition and call it a day. Instead, it thoughtfully combined the base game with its expansions, streamlining the gameplay, updating the visuals, and introducing new features, all while preserving that cozy game feel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is something that feels like both a sequel and a revision. Either way, the 2nd Edition of Parks is a great excuse to hit the trails, snap some photos, and fill your canteen all over again.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What's in the Box</h2><div catalogid="04f06aa9-6449-4d2e-9c89-8b6612131675" id="220791"><div id="220791" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Parks (2nd Edition)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the original version, the second edition of Parks comes in a beautifully designed box packed with components that live up to its iconic design. Right on top, you'll find a textured, high-quality rulebook that's easy to follow and includes a QR code that links to a helpful video if you prefer to learn by watching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Parks is relatively straightforward to play, it includes a wide variety of components. Two log-shaped containers hold the game's colorful wooden tokens, representing the resources you'll collect while hiking the trail. Beneath those is a tri-fold game board with clearly marked spaces to guide you easily through setup. The game board has been completely redesigned and expanded, with an all-new permanent trail area, canteen tile drafting section, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real standout is the built-in storage tray at the bottom of the box, which is the best I’ve seen across the 60-plus board games I own. Everything has its place, from tokens and tiles to dice and cards, all packed efficiently to keep the game’s footprint compact, while making cleanup a breeze. The tray holds decks for the Parks, Gear, Passion, Ranger Teddy, and Volunteer Projects cards, along with solo reference cards, Season and Campsite tiles, Photo and Hiker tokens, Trail Site tiles, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player gets a board featuring an empty backpack and water bottle, with clearly marked sections around the edges for organizing visited and reserved parks, purchased gear, and more. The Backpack holds up to 12 resources, while the water bottle has six spaces for Canteen tiles you can fill as you play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest updates in the 2nd Edition is the expanded card set, which now includes <em>all</em> 63 U.S. National Parks, up from 48 in the original. The cards feature all-new artwork and clean iconography that better matches the game's updated, more colorful design. While some fans may miss the original illustrations from the <a href="https://59parks.net/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fifty-Nine Parks print series</a>, the new art feels more cohesive and fits well with the rest of the game’s style. Each card includes the park’s name, founding date, and a short blurb about what makes it unique.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay in the second edition of Parks is a streamlined take on the original, incorporating elements from both expansions. The goal is simple: score the most points by hiking the trail, visiting parks, snapping photos, and completing optional objectives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To set up, each player takes a pair of hikers and the matching player board. They also receive a random Canteen token, placed on their board, and a Campfire token flipped to its lit side if playing with more than three players. Each player is then dealt two Passion cards and chooses one to keep, discarding the other. Lastly, the First Hiker token is given to the designated starting player.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Gameplay in the second edition of Parks is a streamlined take on the original, incorporating elements from both expansions.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Passion cards provide small thematic goals to chase during the game, such as visiting parks with specific icons, using Wildlife tokens to take photos, or buying Gear from the item shop. Once completed, you can flip the card to choose one of two rewards: an ongoing effect that lasts the rest of the game, or an endgame bonus that adds extra points to your final score. Some Passions are easier to complete than others, and I usually leaned toward the endgame bonuses as those extra points were often the difference between winning and losing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each round in Parks takes place during one of three seasons: spring, summer, or fall. All three seasons are drawn randomly at the start of the game and each offers a unique bonus, such as rewarding players for collecting the most of a specific resource or visiting parks with certain icons. While spring and summer don’t grant any extra points, the fall season awards three bonus points to the winner, making it especially appealing. Players can choose to ignore these objectives, but they offer useful incentives if they align with your goals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On their turn, players move one of their two hikers forward along the trail, collecting resources or performing the action on the Trail Site tile above the space they land on. Since you can only move forward toward Trail’s End, careful planning is key. Trail Site tiles can offer specific resources like sun, water, forest, and mountain; let you buy Gear from the item shop; allow you either to take a photo by exchanging any resource or add a token to your Canteen; roll the Trail Die for a random bonus; or trade any resource for a Wildlife token (which, fittingly, acts as a wild resource token). Every tile is shuffled each season to keep things fresh and unpredictable, except the Parks space, which is permanently located in the middle of the trail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Landing on the Parks space lets you either reserve a park or visit one by paying its resource cost. If you have enough resources, you can even visit multiple parks on the same turn, making this space crucial for scoring points. Because of that, it’s often the most hotly-contested spot on the board. Thankfully, there’s no limit to how many parks you can reserve, and no penalty for not visiting them before the game ends. However, since you can’t reserve and visit in the same action, each choice on this space carries real weight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parks is ultimately a game about opportunity cost. Every move asks the question: <em>What am I giving up by going here?</em> Many Trail Sites offer one-time bonus resources, so players are racing to grab what they can before others beat them to it. Since each Trail Site is unique each season, and you can't share a space with another player (including yourself) unless you use a lit campfire, every decision matters. You might skip ahead to grab a key resource or reach a specific site, but doing so means sacrificing everything you passed along the way, with no chance to go back until the following season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like many <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-worker-placement-board-games">worker placement games</a>, the real strategy in Parks comes from using both of your hikers in tandem to block opponents from collecting key resources or taking valuable actions. In higher player count games, the trail can get crowded fast, so refreshing your campfire to share spaces becomes essential. In lower player count games, there’s more room to breathe, allowing you to slow down and hit more spots along the trail. When a player reaches the Trail’s End, they choose one of three actions: take the Parks action, pay any resource to take a photo, or buy Gear. The first hiker to arrive at each space also gets a one-time bonus, adding an incentive to rush the trail. This constant push and pull between slowing down to gather resources and racing ahead for rewards is the real special sauce that makes Parks shine.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Parks is ultimately a game about opportunity cost. Every move asks the question: <em>What am I giving up by going here?</em></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Because your Backpack can only hold 12 resources, you need to manage your inventory carefully by spending resources when possible, or you risk having to discard valuable ones at the end of your turn. The Canteen, by contrast, offers flexible bonuses whenever you collect water. Instead of placing the water in your Backpack, you can slot it into a Canteen to gain a resource or perform an action, depending on what you’ve collected. Some tiles even grant powerful effects, like taking the important Parks action. Once used, Canteen bonuses remain unavailable until the next season, so timing matters. Overall, they’re a clever way to give players alternative paths to key actions and resources without relying solely on open trail spaces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another way to earn points on the trail is by taking photos. This is most commonly done by visiting a Trail Site or the Trail’s End space with a photo icon, where you can exchange any single resource to take a photo worth one point. The player with the most photos at the end of the game also earns bonus points, giving you a good reason to snap a few along the way. If you land on a space with the Shutterbug badge, you’ll claim the Shutterbug token, which lets you take a second photo each time you use the photo action, as long as you can pay for it. However, the token can be taken by other players, so make the most of it while it’s yours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During your expedition, you’ll have chances to visit the Gear shop and purchase items to help you along the trail. Gear costs between one and three sun resources, depending on the effect. While Gear doesn’t directly earn you points, it offers light <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine-building</a> opportunities like gaining bonus resources at specific Trail Sites, filling your Canteen after certain actions, or refreshing your Campfire more often. That said, I found the Gear shop to be hit or miss, unless it directly benefits your overall gameplan. You’re usually better off saving your resources for visiting parks, since that’s where the real points are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Parks supports solo play and up to five players, I found it shines best with two or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-three-player-board-games">three players</a>. However, the strategy feels much more cutthroat at two players (a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a>, this is not). Regardless of player count, when only one player has hikers left on the trail, they must move both hikers to Trail’s End on their next turn. This rule keeps players from being too greedy with trying to hit every space along the way, as they risk being rushed and missing out on more valuable opportunities. In a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player game</a>, this is even more noticeable, since one player can jump to the end early and force the other to skip potential turns needed to catch up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you have a few hikes under your belt, you can add optional modules to Parks to increase variety or raise the difficulty. The Camping mode introduces three tents to the trail, allowing you to choose from a pool of powerful bonuses. However, using a tent means you cannot collect resources or use the action at that Trail Site. Volunteer Projects add more challenge by introducing restrictions that players must follow, such as spending extra resources when visiting parks, limiting the number of Wildlife tokens you can hold, or only being allowed to visit parks you’ve already reserved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parks includes a full <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo mode</a> that pits you against Ranger Teddy, an automa made up of two sets of hikers that take actions by flipping cards to determine their movement. Your goal is to achieve the highest score possible, which adds plenty of replayability. While Ranger Teddy’s hikers don’t collect resources, purchase Gear, or visit parks directly, they discard those elements when landing on the corresponding spaces, effectively simulating the pressure of competing players. Because their movement is often unpredictable, you’ll need to stay on your toes in order to succeed. You can also add Ranger Teddy to multiplayer games to simulate more players on the trail and add some variety.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Parks (2nd Edition)</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a03b63?object_uuid=f5a59f38-3e1e-4251-8ac5-9d190a74c934&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgJqo?object_uuid=f5a59f38-3e1e-4251-8ac5-9d190a74c934&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Atomic Empire</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l3eGN?object_uuid=f5a59f38-3e1e-4251-8ac5-9d190a74c934&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Keymaster Games</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QdbZV1?object_uuid=f5a59f38-3e1e-4251-8ac5-9d190a74c934&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">More Family-Friendly Board Games We Recommend</h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 23, 2025 6:50 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Parks (2nd Edition) is a cozy strategy game that pairs beautiful visuals with deceptively simple worker placement. It builds on everything that made the original great, refining the experience with streamlined rules that are easy to learn but still reward smart play. Its interconnected systems create fresh challenges each time you hit the trail, encouraging careful planning and efficient turns. While visiting parks remains central to the experience, new scoring opportunities provide ample ways to outmaneuver your opponents. Optional modules add variety and difficulty for seasoned players, while the revamped solo mode and Ranger Teddy automa provide plenty of reasons to come back for one more hike.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Licensing revenue was £50 million, up from £31 million. Core profit is £210 million, up from £174.8 million, and licensing profit is £45 million, up from £27 million.
