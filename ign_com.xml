            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Don't forget your complimentary loadout!</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Stella Montis is known for its cold, suffocating halls and cutthroat Raider encounters, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> players can’t get enough of the real-life Stella Montis hotel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, there is a real-world hotel located in Italy that just so happens to share a name with one of the most brutal locations game developer Embark Studios has to offer. Thankfully, the luxurious hotel Stella Montis won’t have guests looking over their shoulders for loot goblins, and instead features spots for hiking, biking, skiing, and relaxation. It’s for these reasons – and maybe more likely just for the bit of it all – that Arc Raiders players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qjg3ml/hotel_stella_montis_is_getting_flooded_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>slamming the forest getaway with dozens of five-star reviews</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Great place,” one seemingly earnest review starts. “But I do recommend travel solo for this hotel. Any group bigger than 2 has very high chance of meeting rats in the lobby. Hotel has a medical section which is a hot spot for dead bodies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Also while you are here please try to be friendly to other guests.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first connection to the real-life Stella Montis seems to have arrived shortly after Embark initially teased the new map in <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/everything-you-need-to-know" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an October 13 blog post</u></a>, two weeks before launch. In what was likely an attempt to try and connect the dots before an official reveal, one Reddit user was able to track down the hotel and post about it (above), assuming the new Arc Raiders map could be inspired by a real place.</p><p>Love this place, always leave with 3+ blueprints.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not clear if the sleek metal walls of the video game map are actually named after the Italian inn, but the coincidence was more than enough for fans to latch onto. A review left by a user with the name Bad Wolf seems to be the oldest mention of Arc Raiders, at least on Google, with almost every reply that followed focusing on blueprints, Bastions, “rats,” and Shredders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I love this place, tons of drawers that gives me epic loot and even Venator blueprint if you have the correct hotel keycard,” another review says, “but be careful about the moving balls that burn you and the vase like robot thingy that would shred you to pieces. The only complain is the raiders with strange red outfit that screams ‘Goop’ crawling in the corner waiting for you to pass by, bring smoke, tagging, and trigger nades just in case.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Stella Montis’ crushing difficulty and brutal Arcs, almost every Google review from an Arc Raiders player awards the hotel with 5/5 stars – though there are a few outliers. One user left a 3/5, warning of Shredders, while another from this week stuck with a 1/5, complaining of feeling “very sweaty after leaving.” Meanwhile, the company behind the hotel has yet to comment on its newfound connection to a popular video game or the fans who have suddenly become enamored by it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Free Loadout Stella Montis go crazy," one reviewer adds. "Love this place, always leave with 3+ blueprints. Remember to search the containers in the cargo docks, they have some goop."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 30, 2025. Although it doesn’t seem like there are any plans to add a skiing expansion to the game, Embark has recently laid out its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026">roadmap for the first four months of 2026</a>. Meanwhile, the studio says it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters">still doing its best to combat widespread reports of cheaters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

IKEA just recently posted a TikTok with some very familiar sights and sounds, and it has us hoping for a furniture collaboration soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-ikea-collab/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a>, the official TikTok page for IKEA France <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ikeafrance/video/7597860813692472608?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-93JTvzdyqdS" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a video</a> two days ago that very much seems to be teasing something Animal Crossing-related. In the video, a very distinctively Animal Crossing leaf floats down from the ceiling of an empty room, before a hand cursor clicks on it and turns it into furniture, cycling through four different types of IKEA furniture (two bookcases in different styles, a dresser, and a couch). The video description, via TikTok's translation from French, reads, "We still don't accept cash bells. #ikea #animalcrossing"</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@ikeafrance/video/7597860813692472608" data-video-id="7597860813692472608"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ikeafrance?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="@ikeafrance" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ikeafrance</a> On n'accepte toujours pas les clochettes en caisse. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/ikea?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="ikea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ikea</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/animalcrossing?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="animalcrossing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#animalcrossing</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/son-original-IKEA-France-7597860865366412064?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="♬ son original  - IKEA France" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ son original  - IKEA France</a> </section> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The background music, while not identifiable immediately as any specific Animal Crossing theme, certainly has the correct xylophone and according sounds going. And the sound effects of clicking and cycling between furniture are 100% straight from Animal Crossing. To me, that reads that whatever's going on here at minimum has Nintendo's blessing.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/23/screenshot-2026-01-24-09-49-28-1769201445843.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image courtesy of KBABZ</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, IKEA and Nintendo have collaborated on Animal Crossing stuff before. Five years ago, <a href="https://animalcrossingworld.com/2020/08/ikea-creates-amazing-animal-crossing-new-horizons-themed-furniture-catalog/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA Taiwan recreated one of its print catalog</a> using nothing but screenshots from Animal Crossing: New Horizons. IKEA has also done proper in-game collaborations with games like The Sims in the past, so it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to see something like IKEA furniture in Animal Crossing, or Animal Crossing furniture sold at IKEA. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, I'm all on board of this means we get Blåhaj in Animal Crossing, or a real-life Froggy Chair. We'll keep our eyes peeled for any sort of official confirmation.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, we're still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-big-30-update-just-dropped-a-day-early">having plenty of fun with the big 3.0 update</a> and all the fun new stuff that's been added...well, almost all of it. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/12-player-animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-a-nightmare-because-nintendo-handles-online-functionality-in-the-most-ridiculous-way-possible">12-player co-op seems pretty fraught</a>.
