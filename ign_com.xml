Here’s what he said at the time:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Witcher 4 has been announced. I can't say anything about it. What we know is that Geralt will be part of the game, we just don't know how much, and the game won't focus on Geralt. So it's not about him this time. We don't know who it's about. I'm excited to find out. I want to know! I have not seen any script yet — I mean, I couldn't tell you if I did. This is the thing, so I could be lying through my teeth. But I'm not. Or am I?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt had long made clear that Geralt's saga had come to an end, meaning a new protagonist was fully expected for Polaris, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-stars-geralt-of-rivia-but-not-as-the-main-character">this was the first confirmation he'd be in the next game at all</a> — and fueled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-4-story-fan-theories-ciri-vesemir"><u>some rampant fan theories</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Only a single teaser image, below, has otherwise been revealed for The Witcher 4, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-dev-confirms-teaser-is-a-brand-new-witcher-school">but it was enough to suggest Ciri will be the protagonist this time around</a>. What's considered the "true" ending of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, thanks to its story being continued in canon comics, sees her become a witcher herself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/23/untitled-2-1648052443071.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Witcher 4 teaser image. Image credit: CD Projekt.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But now, Cockle has revealed those comments raised a few eyebrows at The Witcher developer CD Projekt, and he now insists he has no idea if Geralt is in The Witcher 4, or who the main character is — although he admits that a non-disclosure agreement would force him to lie about it if he did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I did go online and I said something about this and then I got slapped by CD Projekt,” Cockle said. “I don't know how true it is. I went off a rumor. I thought I'd seen somebody from CD Projekt say that Geralt will be in Witcher 4 but he won't be the main character. And I don't actually know if that's true now because they came back and they went, ‘We haven't put anything out there, don't say anything.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So the truth is, the answer to your question is, I don't know what it's going to be. I have ideas. I thought I had an idea what it was. And then I was kind of basically told, ‘We haven't told anybody what it is, so where you got that information we don't know.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it might be from a really really old statement that somebody who no longer works for CD Projekt actually put out about three years ago. So Witcher 4 is a complete mystery to me. I actually don't know.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the interview, Cockle said Ciri as protagonist in The Witcher 4 would make sense, pointing to her ability to travel between worlds. He also reveals that years ago he spoke with someone at CD Projekt about what a future Witcher video game might look like, and discussed a Witcher origin story, among other ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, though, Cockle is keeping his cards close to his chest here. “The truth is I can’t answer the question because I’ve signed an NDA,” he said. “So even if I did know, I’d have to lie to you.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/10/gettyimages-1356685274-1733820615489.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Doug Cockle insists The Witcher 4 is a mystery to him.

As part of its <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-wraps-up-the-third-quarter-of-2024/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>latest financial results</u></a>, the Polish company said that Project Polaris — the first instalment in the new Witcher trilogy — had progressed from preproduction to full-scale production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m proud to confirm that several weeks ago the Polaris team wrapped up preproduction and moved on to full-scale production — the most intensive phase of development,” commented joint CEO Michał Nowakowski. “We are very pleased with our progress on this project, and I wish to thank the team for its dedication.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm thrilled to announce that Project Polaris has entered the full-scale production phase," game director Sebastian Kalemba <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a>. "With new challenges just around the corner, it’s the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what’s on the other side of the coin!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt currently has 400 developers working on Polaris, the majority of its 650-person total development staff. That's down from the 410 reported at the end of July. 64 are working on Orion, the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, 42 on Sirius, The Witcher game developed by The Molasses Flood, and 18 on Hadar, CD Projekt's brand new IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer had indicated it had left Cyberpunk 2077 development behind, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-gets-surprise-update-22-cd-projekt-still-has-some-gas-in-the-tank">the studio plans to reveal Update 2.2 later today</a>, December 10, in a surprise patch release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

While Rocksteady doesn't plan to release any new content, Suicide Squad's story will remain playable via offline mode and it will be possible to play co-op with friends. Previous seasonal content will also continue to be available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, Rocksteady said Suicide Squad will remain available for purchase and that its in-game store will continue to function after Season 4 along with its in-game LutherCoin currency. Rocksteady didn't indicate how long it plans to keep Suicide Squad online after it finishes releasing new content.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">A difficult release for Suicide Squad</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Suicide Squad Season 4 will mark the end of what has been a fraught release for Rocksteady. It struggled with mixed reviews when it came out back in February and never really recovered its momentum. We wrote in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">at the time</a>, "Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a thoroughly frustrating game to play. There are things to enjoy here, with combat that’s snappy enough to carry it through a genuinely good DC comics story artfully dressed in high production values. But everything else just falls down around it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Suicide Squad ended up struggling on the sales front, spurring a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-spurs-double-digit-drop-in-wb-gaming-revenue">double-digit decline in revenue for Warner Bros. gaming</a>. It joins several other online games that have struggled in 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-review">including Concord and XDefiant</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Suicide Squad's final season will begin with the release of Episode 7 on December 10 and will conclude with the release of Episode 8 next month.

The cash is included in a settlement that was originally revealed in late 2022. As the post explains, at the time, Epic was required to pay $245 million to resolve claims that it “used design tactics known as dark patterns to trick players into making unwanted purchases, let children rack up unauthorized charges without any parental involvement, and blocked some users who disputed unauthorized charges from accessing their purchased content.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/03/fortniteogchapter1season1cinematicteasertrailer-ign-blogroll-1733241594258.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The FTC is starting payment distribution related to 2022 Epic Games fine today.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The FTC says it is distributing 629,344 payments today and will send additional payments “at a later date.” The average payment comes in at $114 and is being delivered via PayPal and cash checks.

In addition to the aforementioned $245 million in refunds related to dark patterns, the Fortnite developer was also fined $275 million for violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection [COPPA] rule, bringing the total to more than $520 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the Commission,” FTC chair Lina Khan said at the time, “and these enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of the FTC’s decision, Epic released its own statement on the matter. In <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-ftc-settlement-and-moving-beyond-long-standing-industry-practices" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the message posted to its website</u></a>, the company promised to move past “long-standing industry practices.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We share the underlying principles of fairness, transparency and privacy that the FTC enforces, and the practices referenced in the FTC’s complaints are not how Fortnite operates,” Epic said. “We will continue to be upfront about what players can expect when making purchases, ensure cancellations and refunds are simple, and build safeguards that help keep our ecosystem safe and fun for audiences of all ages.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite heavy fines from the FTC, Epic is pushing forward with more Fortnite content for its millions of fans.
