To honor this promise, we’ve made the decision to move the release date to September 19, 2025 to allow for extra polishing work.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We understand that this may be disappointing, but our experience has shown how important the first impression is”, the Polish studio continued. “With just four additional weeks, we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great. Areas we want to improve include finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscenes and player animations further as well as adding last little details.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the announcement, it was also shared that The Beast will be playable via a public demo at this year’s gamescom, and that next week, updates on the game’s progress will continue with a look into its gore.
