            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has revealed our first look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> gameplay in brief snippets shown during a livestream.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the Capcom Spotlight event, Capcom showed a small portion of first-person gameplay, heavy on the horror and featuring new protagonist FBI Agent Grace Ashcroft. We see the character slowly move around creepy corridors with just a lighter for company. At one point, we see Ashcroft turn around to see a hulking humanoid creature close in on her from the shadows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In another clip of first-person gameplay we see Ashcroft explore a grand hallway, this time holding a handgun (as an FBI agent Ashcroft is handy with guns). She's also able to "act with calm, deductive reasoning," and we see her inspect a toolbox in the classic Resident Evil up close style to demonstrate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, we get a very brief look at third-person Resident Evil Requiem gameplay where Ashcroft is, once again, exploring creepy corridors and poorly lit rooms. We see that horrible creature again, casually stomping in the shadows.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During the video, Capcom developers explain how the first-person perspective makes for "tense, realistic gameplay," whereas playing in third-person via the over-the-shoulder camera lets you see "more of the action." The third-person persepctive is "great for people who enjoy action-heavy gameplay," Capcom added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem lets players switch between first- and third-person through the Options menu at any point during the campaign. Check out IGNâ€™s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview">Resident Evil Requiem hands-on preview</a> for more information.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil Requiem First Gameplay Screenshots â€” Capcom Spotlight 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, Capcom confirmed Resident Evil Requiem takes place 30 years after the missile strike on Raccoon City that occurs at the end of Resident Evil 3, which explains the enormous crater we saw in the announcement trailer. Indeed, the name "Requiem" was chosen because, as Capcom explains it: "This game is a requiem, a eulogy to those who came before."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no big Leon Kennedy reveal, as some fans had hoped for â€” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-secretly-stars-leon-fans-believe-as-trailer-easter-eggs-and-actors-resume-potentially-point-to-his-return">and even expected</a>. If the Resident Evil veteran is playable in the game, perhaps that reveal will come later. It's worth noting Capcom developers issued some interesting comments around Leon and Resident Evil Requiem in the video, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">which we go over here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem launches February 27, 2026, across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Thatâ€™s a wrap on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omnl-EMxfYE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>June 2025 Capcom Spotlight</u></a>! Todayâ€™s showcase brought 40 minutes of updates, with highlights that include details about why we havenâ€™t seen Leon in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem"><u>Resident Evil Requiem</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds"><u>Monster Hunter Wilds</u></a> Free Title Update 2, and so much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Todayâ€™s presentation mostly focused on four games: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>, Resident Evil Requiem, and Monster Hunter Wilds. However, that doesnâ€™t mean Capcom didnâ€™t make the most of its runtime, with each segment featuring plenty of new information about some of its biggest upcoming games. Some standout moments saw the show reveal new gameplay in a ruined Raccoon City, while others came with a smorgasbord of new content coming to games like Monster Hunter Wilds and Street Fighter 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you missed todayâ€™s show, or if youâ€™re just looking to refresh your memory, fear not: IGN has gathered all of the highlights for you right here. You can check out everything revealed at the June 2025 Capcom Spotlight below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kicking Off With a Pragmata Gameplay Deep Dive</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom kicked off todayâ€™s presentation with more Pragmata gameplay footage, revealing a closer look at how players will be able to utilize the powers of an android girl named Diana and a lunar investigator named Hugh Williams as they team up to fight off a variety of dangerous robots. Gameplay involves thinking on your feet by hacking and shooting enemies in an adventure set on a seemingly abandoned lunar research facility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pragmata launches for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S in 2026. The public will be able to go hands-on with its puzzle-infused combat at gamescom 2025 this August.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Sagat Comes to Street Fighter 6 August 5</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest post-launch Street Fighter 6 character addition is Sagat. Todayâ€™s Capcom Spotlight gave viewers a release date for the character, setting launch for August 5, 2025. We got a closer look at this updated take on the classic, eyepatch-wearing Street Fighter face with a special video.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the Sagat Arrives Fighting Pass will be available starting July 4. It includes new Stickers, Avatar Gear, EX Colors, Challenger Screen illustrations, and more. Street Fighter 6 Year 3 kicks off with Sagat, but other fighters, such as C. Viper, Ingrid, and Alex, are still on the way, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Street Figher 6 Swimsuit Outfits Drop August 5</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">LOOKING at Jamie, Kimberly, and A.K.I.'s Outfit 4! ðŸ‘€ <a href="https://t.co/Jcl84LD87M" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Jcl84LD87M</a></p>â€” Street Fighter (@StreetFighter) <a href="https://twitter.com/StreetFighter/status/1938359933956973040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 26, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Another highlight from Street Figher 6's appearance at the June 2025 Capcom Spotlight included a sneak peak at the new line of Outfit 4 swimsuit updates set to drop in a little more than one month. Seven new looks were revealed, including summer swimwear for Cammy, Luke, Chun-Li, Manon, Jamie, Kimberly, and A.K.I.. You can see concept art for everyone in the images above.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Capcom Talks Resident Evil Requiem and (Kind of) Addresses the Leon-Shaped Elephant in the Room</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A closer look at Resident Evil 9 means more details about protagonist, FBI Agent Grace Ashcroft, its gameplay, Raccoon City, and more. Although this was mostly an opportunity for the Capcom team to talk about some information that fans have already been made aware of, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/brief-look-at-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-reveals-first-person-footage">third- and first-person gameplay</a>, the developers did touch on one hot topic: Leon S. Kennedy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, it remains unclear if the legendary video game survivor will be playable at some point in Resident Evil Requiem, but the team did walk through <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">why it's hard to make Leon the main character of a horror video game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We always thought about making Leon the protagonist, but making a horror game based around him is difficult," Director Koshi Nakanishi explained. "He wouldn't jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he's actually quite a bad match for horror."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Capcom has Big Plans for Monster Hunter Wilds</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest entry in the Monster Hunter series, Monster Hunter Wilds, took up most of the Capcom Spotlight today, bringing news about future updates, a roadmap schedule, additional content, and so much more to the table. Highlights include a gameplay showing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-next-update-adds-the-long-awaited-lagiacrus">underwater fights with Lagiacrus</a>, a treasure trove of quality-of-life updates, and even a collaboration with Fender guitars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds fans can go hands-on with Free Title Update 2 when it launches Monday, June 30, adding in much of what was shown during today's presentation. The Festival of Accord: Flamefete seasonal event will then follow from July 23 through August 6, with Arch-tempered Uth Duna arriving from July 30 through August 20, and the Fender Event Quest available from August 27 through September 24.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even more Monster Hunter Wilds content and gameplay adjustments are set to arrive in the future, too. Free Title Update 3, for example, is scheduled to launch in late September, adding a new Monster as well as another Festival of Accord seasonal event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Developing...</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apex-legends-the-board-game-review.1229484/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bottling the kinetic energy of a first person shooter video game and successfully transferring it to the tabletop is a herculean task. Publisher Glass Cannon Unplugged is up to the challenge, presenting Apex Legends: The Board Game in the form of an overstuffed box that spills cardboard and plastic onto the table like a body lit up by a VK-47 Flatline. This analog translation defies the odds, legitimately capturing some of the visceral action of its namesake with unique and clever design work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> the video game is a hero shooter battle royale. It has a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/apex-legends/Characters_(Legends)">full lineup of protagonists</a> with their own suite of abilities and playstyles. This identity is likewise the heart of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">board game adaptation</a>, forming the basis for its team-based skirmish action. Characters such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/apex-legends/bangalore">Bangalore</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/apex-legends/mirage">Mirage</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/apex-legends/bloodhound">Bloodhound</a> all make an appearance, with each of their roles expertly captured and adapted to the turn-based setting. Everything is powerful and awe inspiring, and it feels extraordinarily faithful to the property.</p><div catalogid="59f120e6-93ee-456b-ada0-ea76f3f22000" id="223645"><div id="223645" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apex Legends: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The standard format is either two-versus-two, or three-versus-three, with each player fielding a single character. While there are a bevy of miniatures skirmish games on the market, including popular titles such as Kill Team, Infinity, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-shatterpoint-board-game-review"><u>Star Wars: Shatterpoint</u></a>, none offer this particular style of team-based small-unit approach. Distinctly, this is not a game of armies or squads â€“ itâ€™s one of personalities and legends. The result is an altogether different tone, one charged with dynamic abilities that form the centerpiece of a violent gunfight on a fully rendered board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The board is quite the looker. Verticality is a core tenet of gameplay, as players are able to scale and fight from 3D cardstock buildings. Other elements pop off the map, including cardboard trees and boulders, loot containers, and even fully operational ziplines. The environment is active and responsive. It feels every bit a playground, albeit one with shrapnel and taunts whizzing by your dome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This dedication to elevation fuels the aggressive FPS-style play, but it also is the root of Apex Legends: The Board Gameâ€™s primary challenge. Iâ€™ve mentioned the gameâ€™s bloated componentry, which contributes to a lengthy setup time, but all of these options and details add up to a relatively complex system. The central turn-to-turn action sequence is surprisingly simple and direct. One team activates all of their characters with each committing to two actions. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This board game defies the odds, capturing the visceral action of its namesake with unique and clever design work.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But that streamlined activity fragments into many intricate pieces. Line of sight is a strong example. Measuring from center square to center square and assessing any blockages is standard for this style of game. But when you consider elevation, all of a sudden there are three pages of lengthy examples displaying potential situations. Thankfully, the rulebook's diagrams do a good job of illustrating what you need to consider, but the downside is that line of sight can be difficult to assess on the fly and it can slow down the pace of play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also tough to remember the difference between some of the keywords, such as "adjacent" versus "neighboring." Terrain items and cards use a similar library of tags that must be referenced. There are specific timing windows for reactions and a sub-system for handling abilities and cooldowns. None of these are overly burdensome on their own, but taken together they can become tricky to navigate. Itâ€™s important to understand that this is not a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">board game for beginners</a>. Instead of going for wide appeal with a similar approach to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-the-board-game-priority-hagalaz-review"><u>Mass Effect: The Board Game</u></a>, Apex Legends aims to satisfy hobbyist gamers familiar with sophisticated systems. If a 40-page rulebook scares you, then youâ€™re not going to hack it on this battlefield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most interesting element of Apex Legends: The Board Game is also the most convoluted. Instead of a sophisticated physics engine handling the shooting mechanism, this game opts to zoom in on the firefight and simulate multiple factors, including recoil, stability, and rate of fire. Most games opt for a handful of dice and some quick arithmetic, but Apex Legends uses a sideboard and a dedicated set of cards to resolve gunshots. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Itâ€™s actually a pretty stellar system. Different guns have various rates of fire. They list a number of cards that are drawn from the shooting deck and placed alongside a track. Each card is placed in a slot representing an individual shot. Cards drawn later in the sequence have more recoil affecting their ballistics, which results in an escalation of penalties. The penalty is applied to the strength of the randomly drawn card, and then compared to the necessary hit value on the weapon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thatâ€™s the quick and dirty explanation. In reality, itâ€™s more nuanced as each drawn card also has a possible icon which can inflict headshots, bonus hits, or cause an automatic miss if the target is behind cover. Weapons that hit exceedingly hard with slower rates of fire â€“ such as a shotgun or sniper rifle â€“ may draw multiple cards to a single shot slot, thus avoiding the recoil penalties the system tries to emulate. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This can be a wonky process to resolve â€“ itâ€™s certainly slow going with new players. Until you get used to it, this is another part of the game that stunts the tempo of action. Obviously this is a cost of modeling the video game with a high level of detail, but it can be an outright turnoff as it highlights the shortcomings of board games and their inability to obfuscate and resolve math.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this level of detail isn't all bad. What you sacrifice in momentum, you gain in realism. This system acutely captures the unique qualities of various firearms. Sub-machine guns spray several weak shots. Battle rifles fire tighter groupings and hit with power. Light machine guns spray all over the place but can level a building. Weapon attachments are mixed in with the loot, allowing you to alter a firearmâ€™s properties mid-game. This includes optics, barrels, magazines, and stocks. Itâ€™s exceedingly cool and really juices up the impact of scavenging for supplies in the battle royale mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end result is a weapon system that actually boasts gunplay. No other board or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tabletop-game-alternatives-to-warhammer-40000">miniatures game</a> I've played has so meticulously modeled this key feature of first person shooters. Itâ€™s a fantastic accomplishment and absolutely the standout feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond this wonderful feat, Apex Legends: The Board Game offers several other killer features. Characters are expertly modeled. They have asymmetric tactical abilities and ultimates that affect the battlefield in various ways. You can pop smoke, call in airstrikes, and deploy drones. Each character is also paired with a unique deck of cards that can be played to tweak actions and react to opponentsâ€™ maneuvers. This creates a nifty fog of war, although again, at the cost of possibly slowing down the pace of play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another crowd pleaser is the variety of modes on offer. The battle royale option is the key offering, including a distillation of the final moments of the video gameâ€™s finale. This includes a barrier that closes on the battlefield, forcing combatants into tighter and tighter area. But there are also deathmatch, VIP, and capture the flag options. Each of these is fully realized and not at all an afterthought.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those sickos who canâ€™t get enough, this game also will be arriving with expansion products for additional characters as well as a new board and environment. Most notably, there is a sophisticated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solitaire</a> / <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">co-op</a> addition that adds AI behavior trees to each of the core gameâ€™s protagonists. This mode works fairly well, producing mostly logical enemy actions that sometimes surprise and dazzle. Again, much like the rich base game ruleset, it can be a sluggish pace to familiarize yourself with this additional layer of rules, but it certainly settles down once youâ€™ve become comfortable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a first-person shooter airdropping to your tabletop, Apex Legends: The Board Game is a solid effort and certainly a success. There are challenges involved and the tempo can really drag as players learn the systems and assess the wide swath of options on their turn. Once familiarity sets in and the game starts collapsing towards that 60-90 minute estimated playtime, the bliss of gunplay coupled with dynamic action and a multi-faceted loot system truly shine. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpXVy?object_uuid=1a4cdcfc-6638-451d-b767-27674f9d015b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Miniature Market</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 26, 2025 7:34 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Apex Legends: The Board game is a huge, intricately designed game that can be both overwhelming and thrilling. All of the moving parts make for occasionally clunky and slow gameplay, but itâ€™s reliably a fierce one full of individuality. Thereâ€™s nothing quite like this on the market, and that makes up for any shortcomings.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-the-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

Star Wars Battlefront II is an especially good deal, as there has been a major resurgence in online players as of late.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the smaller discounts available is for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. While you'll only save $5 during the Steam Summer Sale, this is the lowest we've seen this game yet. If you've been on the fence about picking this one up, it's not likely to dip much further until late this year, especially since it is one of the highest-rated games of the year.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Amazon Prime Day Arrives at the End of the Steam Sale</h3><div catalogid="a568cc81-560f-48fe-bbf9-5308ce73a03f" id="223504"><div id="223504" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>All Early Prime Day Deals</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Steam Summer Sale is ongoing right now, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-2025-everything-we-know-so-far">Amazon Prime Day</a> is set to kick off on July 8. This year, Amazon has doubled the length on the sale, making it the longest Prime Day to date. Though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-time-to-buy-video-games">PC games</a> are not usually a focus of Prime Day, you can expect to have the opportunity to score a few deals on PC hardware, monitors, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-keyboard">accessories</a>, and more. If you're looking to either enter the PC market for the first time or upgrade your existing setup, keep your eye on Prime Day. This is also when more of the console games will likely go on sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-early-prime-day-2025-offers-free-games-prime-gaming">currently offering free PC games</a> as part of an early Prime Day promotion. So if you are a Prime member already, it's worth diving into that and picking up some freebies before they're gone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.
