Preorders just dropped on Amazon, which are conveniently found below because I'm an absolute legend like that. Speaking of Switch 2, I've included a solid deal on the best-selling TomToc slim carrying case to protect that hefty chunk of change.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN Store only has a stunning Master Sword replica in stock too, complete with its scabbard and a sleek display stand. Unfortunately, you won't be able to destroy anything with it as it's not a real sword, but it's a cracking collectible to have above the fireplace or on your back consistently. Moving onto today's tech deals, I've found a banging deal on one of the best gaming monitors at the moment, Samsung 57"Odyssey Neo G9 and a bag full of Apple Mac and iPad discounts. Let's get into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Restock Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Checking these prices against TCG Player secondary market values, a lot of these products aren't far off the mark. Make no mistake, they're still way off MSRP, but finding Pokémon products on shelves that haven't been marked up past the point of anyone caring is a positive. Still refusing to pay over MSRP for new sets? Well played, I'm proud of you. Here's some single card highlights for you to shuffle through instead. Spoiler, there's plenty of deals to be had.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Singles Are On The Rise (Again)</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to stick a pin on Destined Rivals single card values right now, and the dips in value seem to match the little bits of stock distributors release to stores. Looking at the tracking charts for each of these cards, we can see mostly plummets from day one, then either upticks or cards for sale that exceed the original value at launch. It's crazy, but we now know how low these cards can go. Sure there's always attempts at market manipulation, but I wouldn't buy any cards on the rise right now.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Journey Together Singles Are Settling In Value</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having keeping an eye on the market since launch, Journey Together singles are now more affordable than ever. Many of these cards have stabilized, with the main chase card - Lillie's Clefairy ex SIR, settling at around $150. If you were planning on getting into Journey Together at some point to collect the illustration rares and SIRs, now is a great time to jump in.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Epic Primastic Evolutions Cards That Aren't Umbreon</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's so many great cards in this set that aren't Umbreon ex SIR, all of which are a damn sight more affordable right now. Because I hate anything popular (Yes, I know I'm a massive fan of the most popular IP on earth), my two favorite cards are Dragapult ex SIR and Roaring Moon ex SIR. The former is now down to a respectable $125, with the latter holding it's value well since launch, floating towards the $200 mark. These prices and below are great deals for these cards, so don't miss out.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Discounted MTG: Aetherdrift Boxes </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering discounts at a big box store like Amazon? Surely not! Aetherdrift turned the MTG meta on its head introducing vehicles and other unique mechanics. This is a great time to jump into it and rip open some packs, it's deffinately one of the most "out there"  twists on the ever popular trading card game.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Buy MTG: Final Fantasy</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's finally here, Magic the Gathering: Final Fantasy is out in the wild. If you got a preorder for MSRP, well played, but many TCG and Final Fantasy fans missed out. Fear not, there's still some options on sealed products available right now, including options from the secondary market with TCG Player which is around the same or lower than the pricing of big box retailers right now.</p><p id="donkey-kong-bananza"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Donkey Kong Bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</h2></p><div catalogid="12468fbf-8990-4f79-9cda-997cbff2a2aa" id="223102"><div id="223102" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Donkey Kong Bananza</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-donkey-kong-bananza-direct-for-this-week">Nintendo Direct dropping for Donkey Kong Bananza</a> tommorow, it's a good time to make sure you've got the Mario Odyssey-esque 3D platformer secured for day one. This physical edition has the full game on the cart and is giving DK the kind of 3D platforming love it's been missing since the Nintendo 64 days.</p></div><p id="switch-2-tomtoc-slim-carrying-case"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Switch 2 tomtoc Slim Carrying Case">Switch 2 tomtoc Slim Carrying Case</h2></p><div catalogid="12468fbf-8990-4f79-9cda-997cbff2a2aa" id="223103"><div id="223103" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Switch 2 tomtoc Slim Carrying Case</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Switch 2 case isn't a chunk, protects all the buttons including the shoulders and triggers and has been tested for drops and bumps that are bound to happen.

The cuttons to activate it all are easy to reach when holding it, and in all honesty it sounds so cool. Just don't go hitting your mate over the head with it, I reckon It would still hurt!</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Borderlands 4 Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 preorders have finally landed, and the started edition is just under the $70 mark in a suprising move after the<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-standard-edition-price-set-at-70-after-all"> comments made by Randy Pitchford</a>.
