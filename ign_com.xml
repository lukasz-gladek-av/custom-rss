We didn't get to see much of the game, but the environments we got a brief look at appeared to be significantly visually improved from the original.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the announcement, developer P-Studio director Kazuhisa Wada shared the following messages:</p><blockquote>We are very pleased to announce the release of Persona 4 Revival. We look forward to sharing even more information in due time.</blockquote><blockquote>Persona 4 has spawned numerous spin-off works, including TV anime, Persona 4 Arena, Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, and Persona 4: Dancing All Night, and is a special title that has been a part of Atlus for many years and holds a personal place in my heart. We are currently working on this project with all our passion and love. We are confident that this will be a fresh and surprising product for both newcomers and long-time fans and we look forward to sharing it with you all.</blockquote><blockquote>Additionally, we are actively preparing for the future development of the Persona series as a studio. We are working hard to meet the expectations of fans around the world and our work is progressing well. Please stay tuned for more updates.</blockquote><blockquote>We look forward to your continued support of the Persona series.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have been gossiping about a proper Persona 4 remake for a while now, fueled by recent registered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-a-new-domain-discovery-is-getting-persona-4-fans-excited-for-a-possible-remake">domain names</a>, industry insiders, and more recently, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-4-remake-is-apparently-happening-as-voice-actor-confirms-hes-not-coming-back-for-it">multiple of the original voice actors</a> saying they would not be returning for the then-unannounced remake, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/two-more-persona-4-actors-have-said-theyre-not-returning-for-an-unannounced-persona-4-remake">sparking conspiracy theories</a> about their posts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/12/10/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-review">gave the original Persona 4 a 9/10</a> back in the day, saying, "A significant improvement over the previous Persona games in many ways, Persona 4 provides a deeper dungeon crawling/social link experience that makes it engaging to play."

It's exactly what it sounds like: a 3D Super Meat Boy game, and it's coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC in early 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's trailer sure does look like exactly what is says on the tin: it's fast, gory gameplay through short, sharp obstacle courses full of machines that can tear a little meat guy apart. Meat Boy bounces his way through them, leaving a trailer of, uh, meat juice, wherever he lands, with slidey physics down walls and tight jumping windows. But of course, it's all in a 3D world instead of a 2D space, which will likely dramatically change how the platforming works, where you can go, and the sorts of challenges placed before you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meat Boy began as a 2008 Flash game created by Edmund McMillen and Jonathan McEntee that has since grown into a sensation with the subsequent release of Super Meat Boy a few years later. Super Meat Boy is an ultra-hard platformer beloved for its tight, precise platforming and fast respawns on short maps that allow players to try again and again and again with almost no downtime. The games are notoriously gorey, given that the main character is essentially made of meat and keeps slamming into meat grinders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A sequel to Super Meat Boy, Super Meat Boy Forever, was released in 2020 without the involvement of McMillen. It's unclear if McMillen is involved in this 3D rendition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Weirdly, there was a green Mario warp pipe shown at the start of the trailer, despite Super Meat Boy 3D not being announced for a Nintendo console at the moment, and this being an Xbox showcase. No explanation for that at the moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced-so-far">today's Xbox Games Showcase right here</a>, and keep up on the bevy of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-reveals-from-ign-live-2025">new announcements all weekend at IGN Live here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
