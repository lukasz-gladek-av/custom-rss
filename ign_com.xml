            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We're selling this unique art form."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The boss of Take-Two has discussed Rockstar’s approach to marketing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, saying it needs to be “delicate.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, as part of its latest financial results, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-marketing-will-kick-off-this-summer-as-take-two-confidently-reaffirms-november-release-date">Take-Two said marketing for what will surely be the biggest entertainment launch of all time kicks off this summer</a> ahead of GTA 6’s confirmed November 19, 2026 release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a statement of intent that Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick doubled down on in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2026/02/04/mobile-is-fastest-growing-part-of-interactive-entertainment-business-take-two-ceo.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with CNBC’s Jim Cramer</a>. When asked how he knows GTA 6 will hit November, Zelnick said development progress is tracked every day, and pointed to the marketing milestone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We also announced that we have marketing beats coming this summer, and we don’t spend money on marketing until we’re pretty close to release,” he explained.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what can we expect from the marketing itself? Zelnick didn’t say exactly, but it sounds like it’ll be something unusual, at least from a video game marketing perspective. In the interview, Zelnick described the effort as a “challenge.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is a challenge, because we want the product to be authentically owned by our consumers,” he said. “And so the marketing has to be delicate. It has to feel like, you know, this is real. We’re not selling hamburgers. We’re selling this unique art form.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What this means is anyone’s guess at this point. Perhaps a social media-fueled ARG of some description? Real world GTA events of some kind that get fans involved? Given the enormous interest in all things GTA, nothing’s off the table here. All fans really want is GTA 6 Trailer 3, of course. That would do.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing Zelnick has been clear on is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-denies-rumors-that-gta-6-will-be-digital-only-at-launch">denying rumors that GTA 6 will be a digital-only release upon its initial launch</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">As unhappy players fight to get refunds out of Steam, an update from one of the studio's directors claims the "entire" development team working on the ill-fated MMO <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ashes-of-creation"><u>Ashes of Creation</u></a> was reportedly laid off without notice or their January paychecks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The shocking revelation comes from Intrepid Studios' former director of communications, Margaret Krohn, who revealed in a lengthy <a href="https://x.com/MargaretKrohn/status/2018794224276377819" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on Twitter/X that three days after originally being told around 100 developers would be losing their jobs, a "confusing email" arrived confirming "all" staff would be laid off. "It is still shocking," Krohn wrote. "The entire studio gathered to try to understand what had happened and what it meant for our future."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-quietly-withdraws-under-fire-mmo-ashes-of-creation-from-sale-as-fans-wonder-whos-left-to-maintain-the-servers"><u>Steam quietly withdrew Ashes of Creation from sale</u></a> after its director and leadership team quit just weeks after it launched as a $50 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Early Access game on Steam</u></a>. The game's director Steven Sharif said "much of" the senior dev team had quit "in protest," claiming that its management board had asked him to do things he "could not ethically support." According to Sharif, the Board then issued WARN Act notices — layoff warnings, in other words — to the remaining staff. It's unclear who sits on this mysterious board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to a new public record request, we now know that the formal WARN Act notification was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qvqe3n/warn_info_updated/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>issued</u></a> on January 31 and indicated that 210 employees were "affected" by the filing, 123 of whom worked in California.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In the end, none of us are receiving our final paychecks, the 60-day notice and pay outlined under the WARN Act, PTO payouts, or other compensation owed," Krohn explained. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What matters most to me now are the people — both the players and developers. To my colleagues: this team is truly a family. The culture we built together is something I have never experienced anywhere else. In the midst of heartbreak and uncertainty, we have come together to review resumes, help with portfolios, share job leads, and support one another emotionally. That says everything about who we are as people."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To the players: the entire development team was working extremely hard, pulling long hours, and wishes with all our hearts that we could give you Ashes of Creation. There are no words that fully express how sorry we are that this journey ended this way. You should pursue a refund, you deserve it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, Steam doesn't seem to agree. While you can find plenty of people across Discord and Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qw4mkd/thanks_steam_all_hail_lord_gaben_and_florence/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>claiming to have received refunds</u></a> despite having played more than two hours, there's an equal number of players frustrated that their requests have been denied, and there seems to be little consistency across Steam's Support team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They denied me with 2.3 hours played. Bought in December and denied because it 'exceeds refund time,'" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qw4mkd/comment/o3mmqqh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a> one player, while another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qvzabf/manual_ticket_refund_request_got_rejected/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>: "I can't believe it… and I'm hearing they froze/reversed the December payment to Intrepid so basically Steam have stollen [sic] my money."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"How many hours did you have? I had 15 Hours played and got refunded on a manual process," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qvzabf/comment/o3ld4ix/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a> one.

That way, your request will be routed to a member of customer support, and not an automated service.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">19,576 backers pledged $3,271,809 on Kickstarter to help make Ashes of Creation a reality, the most ever raised on the platform for an MMO. Refunds via Kickstarter seem unlikely given the game launched in Early Access form.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/screenshot-2026-02-05-at-10-34-29-1770289133235.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Former director and CEO Steven Sharif shares update. Image credit: Discord.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Sharif popped up on Discord briefly on February 4 to write: "It is certainly heartbreaking to see the impact to the people I care about both my developers and community, but given what has transpired and the lack of facts available to the public, the reputational impact is something that cannot be avoided until the record is set straight with the proper public filings. Unfortunately that takes a little bit of time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you can't buy Ashes of Creation from Steam right now, its website is still live and accepting payment for cosmetics. While the site is typically updated several times a month, only one update was posted in the whole of January, and that was alluding to a developer diary livestream coming up on February 13. It's not clear who will host that given reports the entire team has been laid off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <guid>1426438</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation 5 sales declined year-on-year during the crucial holiday quarter, but it’s pretty much neck-and-neck with the PlayStation 4 at the same point during its lifecycle, and it even outsold the Nintendo Switch 2 during the last three months of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony shifted another 8 million PS5 units during the three months ending December 31, 2025, a decline from the 9.5 million PS5s it sold during the same period in 2024. But there are a number of factors at play here. For a start, 8 million sales isn’t too shabby when you consider the PS5 price rises Sony put in place last year (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-5-price-rises-for-us">Sony raised the prices of the PS5, PS5 Digital Edition, and PS5 Pro by $50 each in August</a>). Then there’s the tough economic conditions globally that’s putting pressure on consumer spending generally to contend with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s also worth noting that the PS5, which is now five years old, actually outsold the six month-old Nintendo Switch 2 during the holiday quarter. This week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-acknowledges-switch-2-sales-have-been-slightly-weaker-than-expected-outside-japan">Nintendo said the Switch 2 sold around 7 million in the three-month period</a>. PS5 sold 1 million more.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PlayStation Game of 2025</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS5 has now sold 92.2 million units globally, which means it’s still lagging ever so slightly behind its predecessor, the PS4, at this point in each console’s lifecycle (PS4 had sold 94.4 million by now). But with the release of guaranteed console seller GTA 6 coming in November, the PS5 will receive a shot in the arm that may drive it to outselling the PS4 when the dust settles on both consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here's a fun stat: the PS5 has now officially outsold the PS3. As mentioned, PS5 has sold 92.2 million, and the PS3 managed 87.4 million lifetime sales (as of March 31, 2017). And while the PS5 has some way to go before matching the PS4's 117 million lifetime sales, with the help of GTA 6, it could eventually beat it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking during a webcast reviewed and transcribed by IGN following its financial results, Sony pointed to increased monetization of its growing PS5 install base as well as growing software sales as more than making up for the decline in console sales. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-ghost-of-yotei-exceeded-the-sales-of-ghost-of-tsushima-in-the-same-period-of-time-and-significantly-contributed-to-its-financial-results">It pointed to the release of Sucker Punch’s PS5 exclusive Ghost of Yotei</a>, which made a “significant contribution” to the quarter, as well as ongoing revenue from Helldivers 2 and MLB The Show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“FY25 Q3 sales decreased 4% year-on-year, primarily due to lower hardware unit sales,” Lin Tao, Sony’s chief financial officer, said. “Operating income increased 19% year-on-year, primarily due to the positive impact of foreign exchange rates and the impact of increased sales and network services and first-party software, setting a record for the third quarter in this segment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We upwardly revised our FY25 sales forecast 4% from the previous forecast to 4,630 billion yen, and our operating income forecast 2% to 510 billion yen. User engagement trended well during the quarter with the number of monthly active users across all of the PlayStation in December increasing 2% compared to the last December to a record high of 132 million accounts. And total play time for the quarter increased 0.4% year-on-year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Although conditions in the console hardware market during year-end selling season were more challenging than expected, we were able to steadily expand our PS5 install base in line with our original plan and exceeded 92 million units on a cumulative selling basis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While PS5 hardware unit sales have decreased moderately in the latter half of the console cycle, software revenue from the PlayStation Store reached a record high during the quarter, primarily driven by the contribution of major third-party franchise titles and new hit releases. PlayStation Plus significantly contributed to the results of the quarter as the shift to higher tiers of the service continued.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony even waved away concern about potential further PS5 price rises as a result of the rising cost of memory fueled by the AI boom, insisting it’s already in a position to secure the minimum quantity necessary to manage the year-end selling season of its next fiscal year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Going forward, we intend to further negotiate with various suppliers to secure enough supply to meet the demand of our customers,” Lin Tao continued. “Given the stage of our console cycle, our hardware sales strategy can be adjusted flexibly and we intend to minimize the impact of the increased memory cost on this segment going forward by prioritizing monetization of the install base to date and striving to further expand our software and network service revenue.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony also namechecked Bungie’s live service extraction shooter Marathon, which is due out in March after a significant delay. It sounds relatively confident in the game after it was retooled following negative feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We expect that Marathon, which is scheduled to be released on March 5, will be enjoyed by many users thanks to Bungie having strengthened the gaming experience,” Lin Tao said. “Next fiscal year, we plan to release new titles such as Saros and Marvel's Wolverine, and we intend to enhance our effort to increase the revenue of our studio business.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, an analyst report coming out of Japan suggested that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/high-likelihood-ps6-will-launch-after-2028-according-to-new-analyst-forecast-as-sony-focuses-on-extending-ps5-lifecycle">Sony may push the launch of the inevitable PlayStation 6 beyond 2028 and lengthen the PS5 lifecycle instead</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">David Gibson, senior analyst at MST international who focuses on game and tech companies, published a Japanese language <a href="https://www.sandstoneinsightsjapan.com/post/sony-group-6758%EF%BC%89%EF%BC%8D%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E9%83%A8%E9%96%80%E3%81%AE%E5%A5%BD%E8%AA%BF%E3%81%8C%E7%AC%AC3%E5%9B%9B%E5%8D%8A%E6%9C%9F%E3%82%92%E7%89%BD%E5%BC%95%E3%80%81%E4%BB%8A%E5%BE%8C%E3%81%95%E3%82%89%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8B%E4%B8%8A%E6%98%87%E4%BD%99%E5%9C%B0%E3%81%82%E3%82%8A" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>report</u></a> ahead of today’s financials giving insights into the Sony Group's current performance and potential next moves. “Sony expects the PS5 lifecycle to be longer than that of previous console generations,” Gibson said, adding that this is likely to push the PS6 launch back beyond previous predictions. “There’s a high likelihood that the PS6 launch will occur after 2028.” If Gibson is right, we won't see the PS6 until 2029 at the earliest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gibson suggested that Sony is more focused on existing PS5 users than boosting console sales, something the latest comments from Lin Tao now back up. Regarding PlayStation Network services and active PS5 users, Gibson observed that “PS5 user activity continues to set all-time record highs according to usage data. Sony is focusing more on retaining active users than expanding hardware sales.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Anusak Laowilas/NurPhoto via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
