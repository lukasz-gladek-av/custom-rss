It's "incredibly exciting and original," and "bold work that deserves to be encouraged," at least, according to our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">review</a>. As a result, fans might be hoping for an eventual third game in the series. But for right now, Kojima isn't planning to make Death Stranding 3...even though he already has a concept written.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima said this in an interview in Riyadh, Saudia Arabia, as a part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/AwQDoD9TK6w" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Death Stranding 2 World Strand Tour</a>. When asked by the interviewer about Death Stranding 3, he replied with the following:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm not planning to do that at the moment, because the ending of Death Stranding 2 was my finale of 1 and 2. But I already wrote the concept of DS3, so I have that in data. I hope that someone would create it for me."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time Kojima has suggested that someone else might pick up the mantle of his games after him. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-creator-hideo-kojima-says-hes-left-his-staff-a-usb-stick-of-ideas-for-after-he-dies-kind-of-like-a-will">Back in May</a>, he said that he'd been thinking more and more about his own death lately, prompting him to create a USB stick "kind of like a will" that lays out the future of his studio, Kojima Productions, if he dies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I gave a USB stick with all my ideas on it to my personal assistant, kind of like a will,” he said. “Perhaps they could continue to make things after I’m gone at Kojima Productions… This is a fear for me: what happens to Kojima Productions after I’m gone? I don’t want them to just manage our existing IP.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we won't be getting a Death Stranding 3 anytime soon it sounds like, there's plenty coming from Kojima's mind in the near future. Death Stranding is getting a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-is-getting-an-anime-adaptation-hideo-kojima-says">live-action film adaptation</a> in partnership with A24, and Kojima is busy working on two different games: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kojimas-od-still-in-development-despite-xbox-game-cancellations">horror project OD</a>, in collaboration with Xbox, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project">Metal Gear successor Physint</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“The advantage of every failure . . . is that people now understand how necessary that [oversight] is.”</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After a high-profile failure in Concord and a high-profile success in Astro Bot last year, PlayStation is looking to adjust its strategy to incorporate fewer live service games, more big franchises, and stricter oversight of its owned studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d5859ffc-c4d7-4480-98a6-c1cff07af299" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Times</a>, PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst says the company is hoping to mitigate future big, expensive risks with future games. “I don’t want teams to always play it safe, but I would like for us, when we fail, to fail early and cheaply.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord was not a cheap failure. Analysts estimate Sony spent around $250m on the game, only for it to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">sell so poorly</a> that Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-wave-goodbye-to-playstation-flop-concord-as-it-goes-dark-maybe-forever">shut it down two weeks after launch</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">shuttered its developer</a>, Firewalk Studios, not long after. By contrast, Astro Bot also launched last year to universal acclaim, winning multiple awards and <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/blog/astro-bot/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">selling 2.3 million copies as of March 2025</a>, one of the best-selling games on PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The differences between the two games are myriad, certainly, and their development stories are quite different as well. But what Hulst has taken away from this is that there needs to be more supervision of Sony's owned studios to ensure that games veering in the direction of Concord are spotted before they become expensive failures, so they can be canceled or corrected in time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have since put in place much more rigorous and more frequent testing in very many different ways,” Hulst said. “The advantage of every failure . . . is that people now understand how necessary that [oversight] is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Financial Times spoke to multiple Sony studio heads, who said that this oversight means more focus on group testing, more communication between internal Sony studios, and closer relationships between the studios' top executives. “If we’re heading towards a giant landmine, like there’s another studio making exactly the same game, that’s good information,” said Jason Connell, art director at Ghost of Yōtei studio Sucker Punch.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That comment rings especially poignant in light of Concord's failure, which analysts say occurred for a number of reasons, including an oversaturation of multiplayer, live service shooters. Hulst suggests in the interview that PlayStation isn't as intent on churning out live service games as it used to be. That said, PlayStation does have Bungie's Marathon coming up before March 2026, a game that has<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-concords-failure-and-marathons-delay-sony-admits-playstations-live-service-strategy-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly"> a number of Bungie fans concerned</a> amid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026">delays</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio">staff layoffs</a>, and a general lack of information as to what the game entails.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there's another strategy Hulst also wants to pursue: he wants more, massive Sony IP. Astro Bot's success has come about over the course of multiple games, with the little robot icon growing in popularity each time. According to Financial Times, Hulst wants studios to be thinking about how their IP can be turned into bigger and bigger franchises over time, following in the footsteps of The Last of Us and Uncharted. “We take a very intentional approach to IP creation . . . understanding how a new concept can turn into an iconic franchise for PlayStation, that can then again become a franchise for people beyond gaming,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently on the docket, PlayStation has Ghost of Yōtei and Lost Soul Aside coming this year, with Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls and Housemarque's Saros for 2026. Other games such as Fairgames, Marvel's Wolverine, Naughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, Marathon, and more remain in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-unknown-event-magiccon-live-show</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-one-magic-the-gathering-designer-broke-all-the-rules-and-created-a-sensation.1280142/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Making a Magic: The Gathering card is a long process. To go from an idea to an actual piece of paper in a player’s hand takes <em>years</em>, with each one being discussed, tweaked, tested, proofread, illustrated, and so on as it passes between the many different teams at developer Wizards of the Coast. Unless, that is, it’s a card for the Unknown event that has become the star of every MagicCon live show in recent years, in which case the process is… a bit more loosey goosey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The goose is enormous. It is a goose that you have not seen the likes of, ever.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s Matt Tabak, Principal Editor at WOTC and one of the people responsible for the absurd and extremely popular Unknown event. I went to MagicCon in Las Vegas this year to finally see what Unknown was for myself, and I sat down with both Tabak and Gavin Verhey, Principal Game Designer and originator of the concept, to discuss how it got started, why it became such a hit, and how it impacts Magic as a whole. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MagicCon Las Vegas 2025 - Unknown Event and Card Photos</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But first, let’s cover the basics: Unknown is a way to play Magic designed specifically for the official conventions, called MagicCons, that are hosted a few times a year. It’s a Sealed event, which means you sit down, crack open some retail booster packs, and then build a deck out of whatever you happen to get. The big twist is that, alongside some special rules, you also get a little plastic bag filled with 10 random playtest cards made just for this event – they don’t have any art, their rules text is often cramped, and their faces are literally just stickers plastered over actual cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I find part of the joy of Unknown, why players enjoy it so much, is that it is not fully polished,” Verhey says. “It’s like, ‘Hey, step inside being a Magic playtester for a day.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unknown gives you a hands-on peek behind the design curtain to a degree that was previously quite rare, complete with typos, rough edges, and mechanics that don’t necessarily always <em>work </em>within Magic’s rules. They can be a little broken, hard to track, or just more powerful than anything you’d see in a real set – but the one thing they always have to be is amusing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"If you ask a Magic designer to make Magic cards in their free time, they’ll make something <em>really weird</em>.” - Gavin Verhey</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you make a Magic card that is intended to go into a booster pack that you hope people will buy, the ultimate goal is joy and entertainment, and there are many roads to get there,” Tabak explains. “On an Unknown card, there’s basically one route to joy, and that’s to make them laugh. Every Unknown card is basically just trying to get somebody to laugh.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That could be with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/CA11b/color-pie" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>inside jokes</u></a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/UW13/youre-toast!" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>goofy designs</u></a>, or even silly references to the city your specific event takes place in. For instance, I opened a card called <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/RR04c/at-least-its-a-dry-heat" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>At Least It’s a Dry Heat</u></a> that deals 1,000,000 damage that can’t be prevented or “compared to damage dealt by sources on the east coast,” which has been in Unknown packs for Las Vegas two years in a row now. (“It’s not any cooler, for some reason. The sun is still shining,” Tabak jokingly complains, before begrudgingly adding, “which we’re thankful for.”) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Verhey can basically do whatever he wants with these cards, with fast turnaround times and way less oversight than there is while making regular sets. “I’ll be making unknown cards two-and-a-half weeks before the event happens sometimes,” he tells me, which is a far cry from the years a regular set requires. Verhey says it’s a fun creative outlet compared to the more rigid nature of making real cards, and that other members of WOTC now even randomly send him funny ideas that he’ll often drop straight into the next Unknown card pool. “If you ask a non Magic designer to make Magic cards, they’ll make Magic cards. If you ask a Magic designer to make Magic cards in their free time, they’ll make something <em>really weird</em>.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/23/stardust-deal-crop-1755907609579.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The commander for my first Unknown deck and a spell that put in a lot of work alongside it.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if one ends up clearly out of line, Verhey’s philosophy is that “everything can be fun for three rounds,” which is the most you’ll ever play with a given card in a single event. Tabak similarly emphasizes that “high impact is a priority for these Unknown cards, because [people] have to be immediately wowed and immediately inspired to build decks around them.” That’s due in part to the unique format Verhey has developed for Unknown over the dozen or so times it’s been run since its inception in 2023. It has you building a 60-card Commander deck with no color restrictions that you then play 1v1, which encourages building around a splashy legendary creature and then cramming in as many of the wildest playtest cards as you can reasonably manage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, my commander for the first of the two Las Vegas Unknown events I joined was a card called <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/RZ04r/the-sprinkler-of-stardust" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Sprinkler of Stardust</u></a>, which has the extremely strange ability to turn instant and sorcery cards into creatures that then cast themselves when they deal combat damage. My gameplan ended up revolving around punching my opponent with big spells like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m21/89/bad-deal" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bad Deal</u></a> as many times as I could manage, which was equal parts delightful, devastating, and wholly unique in my three decades of playing Magic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That commander is itself a reference to both a powerful card called <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/iko/216/winota-joiner-of-forces" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Winota, Joiner of Forces</u></a> and the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/introducing-the-commander-format-panel" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Commander Format Panel</u></a> member known for championing it, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/luastardust.com" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Lua Stardust</u></a>. There have been dozens of nods to Magic community members across the history of Unknown, including <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=set%3Aunk+runner&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=set" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a whole series of “Runners”</u></a> as a shoutout to the group <a href="https://loadingreadyrun.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>LoadingReadyRun</u></a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=set%3Aunk+knight&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=set" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a round of “Knights”</u></a> as a wink to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@commandcast" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Command Zone</u></a>, both popular channels that regularly work with WOTC on collaborations. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“MagicCon, in so many ways, is about the people that come." - Gavin Verhey</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“MagicCon, in so many ways, is about the people that come,” Verhey says, “and I was like, ‘Wouldn’t it be cool to give back to the community?’” He sees these personal references as both a way to thank the creators who helped advocate for Unknown back when it was still a wild experiment, as well as a fun “quest” for fans as they then go hunting the show floor for signatures or custom doodles on the otherwise blank cards they opened. “Like everything else I did, I pitched it to one person, they’re like, ‘Sounds great,’ and I said, ‘Sold!’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, when Verhey first pitched the idea for Unknown as a whole, he was confident it would be shot down. It all started when WOTC Senior Operations Manager Scott Larabee asked him to run an event at MagicCon Philadelphia in 2023, but didn’t have any guidance as to what that should look like beyond being a “spectacle event” to excite people. Events with oddball rules were nothing new, but the idea for these playtest cards came from Verhey’s desire to do something that could only come from WOTC’s game design team. His thought before pitching it? “It is going to get killed for sure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was worried about it because it’s essentially making new Magic cards that are never playtested and put out into the world, which is a thing we often don’t like to do. We like to show our high polish and our high gloss and everything. And, historically, there’s been a lot of rigor around these kind of things. Even the playtest cards for <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/mystery-booster" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mystery Booster</u></a>, there was a lot of time and scrutiny put on those cards.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But he pitched it all the same and, to his surprise, he got the blessing of both Vice President of Design Aaron Forsythe and Communications Director Blake Rasmussen, which was all he needed to be off to the races. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/22/img-6232-1755905253401.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Five Unknown cards with custom doodles done by a friend of mine.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Verhey describes the first Unknown event as his “weird little side project” (“It was just me doing it in my free time”), printing all the cards out himself and spending all day stickering them by hand in Philadelphia right before the show with the help of a few members of the event staff (“We had no idea how long it was going to take”). When they realized they still needed to make the booster packs, they dumped the “thousands upon thousands of cards” they had just assembled into Verhey’s suitcase and shook it around to randomize them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was so nervous. I was terrified,” Verhey recalls – but the stakes at the time were actually fairly low in the grand scheme of things. Not many people even knew the event was happening, and both he and Tabak agree that it wouldn’t <em>really </em>have been a big deal if it hadn’t gone well, because that would have just meant they don’t do it again. But it did go well, quickly becoming the talk of the show and immediately being put on the schedule for the next MagicCon, and then growing into one of their marquee draws ever since. They’ve even added a charity drive to part of the event each time, which Verhey admits always gets him a little teary-eyed as the amount they raise continues to go up. “Every show we add more seats, every show we do more.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tabak says that WOTC does encourage individuals to take on “aspirational” projects from time to time but, even in that context, he describes the things Unknown is doing and its impressive popularity as an anomaly. “You’d be surprised [by] the number of things that were just a two-person idea or one-person idea that grew into something special – very, very few, perhaps none, are on the level of Unknown, though.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“Every show we add more seats, every show we do more.” - Gavin Verhey</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unknown still operates outside of WOTC’s usual card making process, but Verhey says the quality did vastly improve when Tabak offered his assistance, as it’s the editing team’s job to make sure cards are as close to perfect as possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When we first learned about these cards that Gavin had just put out into the world by himself – as a team, professionally, we were horrified,” Tabak explains as Verhey smiles alongside him. “Now, personally, I was delighted, and I knew I had to get on board with this, so I immediately hounded Gavin and said, ‘Why don’t you let me look at those cards this time before we send them out into the world?’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But even with a bit more oversight, Tabak tells me they still get to break the rules with these cards when it comes to things like typesetting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“On real typeset cards, we have standards to maintain some measure of readability, we can only put so much text on a card,” he says. “On the playtest cards, we can be a little more <em>forgiving</em>.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tabak describes this as an advantage, but his apprehensive tone while doing so betrays the slight discomfort this clearly still causes the editor side of him. Indeed, they both laugh as Verhey teases that “sometimes Matt will be like, ‘Gavin, your card doesn’t fit,’ and I’m like, ‘I can print it out and all the text is on there; I don’t know what to tell you.’”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/23/ego-prof-crop-1755907667292.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Two Unknown cards inspired by creators in the community - Arin "Egoraptor" Hanson of Game Grumps (left) and Brian "The Professor" Lewis of Tolarian Community College (right)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The way they physically make the playtest cards has matured, too, no longer resting on the shoulders of Verhey and a very large suitcase. They are still individually stickered by hand, but that’s now handled at the offices of WOTC’s event partner, <a href="https://www.pastimesevents.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Pastimes</u></a>, over the course of multiple weeks, with Verhey saying the scale of each Unknown event is “ultimately capped, to some degree, by our ability to just sticker these cards.” (He jokes about considering giving players uncut sheets of printed stickers so they can assemble their own cards, to which Tabak replies, “What if we just give all 600 players scissors? What could go wrong?”)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The structure of the event itself has evolved as well, with player feedback being used to iterate a bit each time. The very first one was normal 40-card Limited, with all the participants split between two teams that they could win points for in a larger competition. It didn’t take long for Verhey to add a commander to the mix, but even that started with the regular color identity rules before first allowing <a href="https://mtg.wiki/page/Partner" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Partner</u></a> commanders to open things up more and then finally getting rid of color restrictions altogether. The goal behind that is to make sure people can use these wacky cards more reliably, but the variety between shows is also just part of the appeal for anyone who goes to multiple MagicCons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think one of the things about Unknown is, to some degree, it has to keep changing and it can’t be the same thing forever,” Verhey says. “So I’m running this current Commander version right now, but we could do something different at a future one, and that's the beauty of Unknown. People have so much faith in it at this point, they’re like, ‘I’m going to sign up, I’m going to come to see this thing, we’ll see what happens.’ And I might totally change the format at some point, which could be pretty fun.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s on us to evolve a ruleset based on what set is in the spotlight at the time, kind of match that and bring them something that they can’t find [in regular Sealed],” Tabak adds on. The Las Vegas event I attended was primarily tied into <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/tarkir-dragonstorm" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Tarkir: Dragonstorm</u></a>, with <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=set%3Aunk+devoted&amp;order=name&amp;as=full&amp;unique=cards" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>special creatures</u></a> linked to its five clans, but the card pool also had <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/UU01/dialogue-tree" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>plenty</u></a> <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/RC08/new-magic-game-plus" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>of</u></a> <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/RW02d/save-point" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>RPG</u></a> <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/unk/UU03d/higher-level-zone-monster" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>references</u></a> as an homage to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-where-to-buy-2025"><u>Final Fantasy crossover set</u></a> that had just come out. Tabak is quick to point out that there are always a lot of newcomers, too – some of whom have no idea what they are getting into before they sit down at the table. “There are definitely people that are surprised when we hand them the playtest cards. They’re like, ‘I don’t know what this is, do I just put it in my backpack?’”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“The number one goal for me is just let people have fun and make them smile and delight them – and if I learn anything, that’s a nice bonus.” - Gavin Verhey</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I was curious how much those playtest cards are actually “playtesting” something, and if WOTC uses Unknown as a real testing ground for ideas given how quickly they can go from concept to public feedback, but it turns out this really is mostly just them having fun. “I'd say [Unknown cards are] like 85% nonsense,” Verhey says, “5-10% ‘here’s a thing we actually tried for the set it was associated with that we didn’t end up using,’ [...] and maybe 5% are like, ‘I actually think this could be cool, let’s see what people think about this.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He wouldn’t give any indication as to which ones fall into that final category, but Verhey says he <em>has </em>used the popularity of some cards in Unknown as “ammo” to convince people internally that something similar could be a good idea for a real set. Besides, even as unofficial, stickered cards, he recognizes that some people have started to take them more seriously, using them in casual Commander decks or even their <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-onlin3-vintage-cube-tournament-black-lotus-prize-pool"><u>cubes</u></a> (a collection of cards that make up a custom Draft set). “The number one goal for me is just let people have fun and make them smile and delight them – and if I learn anything, that’s a nice bonus.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard not to be at least a little bit amazed by both the almost grassroots rise of the Unknown event and the surprisingly bootstrap way it gets made within the multibillion-dollar corporation that is Wizards of the Coast. Tabak says it’s a testament to the company’s culture that this sort of thing is encouraged, but it has still grown far bigger than anyone expected it to (including its creator), going from shaking typo-filled cards in a suitcase to filling up convention floors and raising money for good causes. When I ask if it feels like they sort of got away with something here, Tabak’s response is unequivocal: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Absolutely. And we’re going to keep getting away with it, too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering it was revealed to the world with a trailer that featured four zombie-blasting soldiers singing along to Bon Jovi’s “You Give Love a Bad Name”, I expected <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/john-carpenters-toxic-commando">John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando</a> to be much funnier than it is. Inspired in equal measure by the supernatural horror and buddy action movies of the 1980s, it is big and dumb and goofy… yet never as batshit bananas as you’d expect for a game that’s quite literally about fighting an entity called the Sludge God. But while it may not be that <em>funny</em>, it is <em>fun</em>. You may have already forgotten about that 2023 reveal trailer, but after playing three hours of its co-op missions, I don’t think Toxic Commando is going to fade into the background thanks to its surprisingly solid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>-alike antics.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it is presented akin to a story campaign shooter with cutscenes, plot points, and a lore-dropping man-in-the-chair vaguely modelled after John Carpenter himself, Toxic Commando is clearly designed to be a regular destination for a team of four friends who can run through its missions on repeat. Each expedition takes place on a reasonably-sized open map, dotted with a handful of optional objectives and loot caches alongside the quest’s main goals. With no ticking timer or shrinking circle, you can take your time to collect everything, scour every point-of-interest, and generally mess around with your pals before pushing onwards to the mission’s finale. It’s surprisingly leisurely… at least until the horde applies the pressure. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Saber Interactive, Toxic Commando is built on the studio’s now-signature horde technology that renders hundreds of sprinting zombies simultaneously, allowing for enemies to clamber up walls like a reverse waterfall of rotting flesh. In many ways, Toxic Commando feels like a successor to the game where this tech originated, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/world-war-z">World War Z</a>, and even features near-identical mechanics – during frequent hold-the-line defence objectives, you mow down incoming enemies with the same array of emplaced machineguns, mortars, and electrified grids. It’s just that this time it’s all rendered with a gloriously gross horror aesthetic. Who wants zombies to look like humans when they can look like lamp-eyed freaks from the death dimension?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those freaks burst and break when they’re introduced to the hot lead dispensed by a very healthy arsenal. They’re all based on real-world guns (aside from the wildly powerful rail gun, which scatters foes like bowling pins) and divided up into your regular groups of shotguns, SMGs, sniper rifles, and other formats not beginning with “S”. Saving them from feeling utterly ordinary is how they fire with the exaggerated bravado of an ultra-violent b-movie – all sputtering muzzles, wide bullet spread, and explosive impacts. Legs are severed, ribcages torn open, and brains pinwheel out of busted skulls. It’s all as squelchy and sinewey as you’d hope from a game associated with the director of The Thing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your choice of loadout defines the combat experience much more than the four character classes, which feel like minor augmentations to standard FPS action rather than crucial battlefield roles. Each is defined by a single special ability – the Operator uses a drone that automatically bombards enemies for a few seconds, the Strike can unleash a barrage of energy blasts, the Medic has an area-of-effect heal, and the Defender can put up a damage-absorbing barrier. At least during my hours of play, these abilities came in handy during a pinch but did little to direct how I played. Perhaps filling out the skill tree will give each class stronger definition, but right now it seems like the regular shooting is the main event.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s admittedly very little new or experimental in Toxic Commando, but what’s here is genuinely good fun. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mowing down a lot (<em>a lot</em>) of zombies is the crux of Toxic Commando’s objectives. Sometimes that’ll involve the genre-trademark special infected that largely work exactly as Left 4 Dead dictated (sticky ones that grab you, tanky ones that charge at you, gross ones that spit at you.) Elsewhere you’ll need to unload a belts-worth of ammunition into a tangled mess of tentacles, or use demolition charges to blow some kind of growth to smithereens. It’s mostly by-the-numbers co-op shooter fare, but across the few missions I’ve played there’s the odd one that shines brighter. One quest sees the map covered by a Fortnite-ish, life-sapping storm, and the only way to navigate between the shielded pockets of safety is to drive an ambulance that can trickle heal those sitting inside it. It’s a really coherent meshing of environment, situation, and equipment design.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of if the mission requires one or not, vehicles are as significant to Toxic Commando as its zombies and guns. The spaced-out objectives and open nature of the maps mean you’ll need some wheels to effectively cover ground, especially as that ground is so often practically carpeted by the undead. Cars like the armoured Maverick are good for both protection and doubling as a battering ram – you’ll just need to occasionally deal with the zombies who clamber aboard like particularly diseased monkeys at the safari. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All vehicles have a special ability, such as the ambulance’s healing aura or the Thunder pick-up’s flamethrower, but it's the winch attached to all but the family sedans that really makes a difference. Essentially a grapple hook that can be fired into a variety of anchor points, it can be used to rip gates off their hinges, bust open treasure containers, and pull your vehicle up slippy inclines. See, the Sludge God, in his infinite sticky wisdom, has covered each map in great big stretches of gloop, and so without a MudRunner-lite approach you’ll be spinning tires and going nowhere. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s admittedly very little new or experimental in Toxic Commando, but what’s here is genuinely good fun. It’s a more open take on Left 4 Dead’s horde-filled adventures, fuelled by the same “arcane evil” feel that’s made Call of Duty’s zombie mode feel so aesthetically solid. There are some issues that threaten that fun, though. Every mission I played felt like it had had the wind kicked out of it by the final stretch thanks to dwindling resources. Health kits are in short supply, ammunition can get a little tricky, and spare parts - a currency that unlocks special weapons and defensive structures – can only be found in a limited number of loot caches. By the end of a mission it can feel like the odds are really against you, and while I appreciate the need to ratchet tension and create a challenge spike in the final objective, in a game where zombies arrive by the truckful, restocking ammo only to find you’ve been given a single magazine does feel a bit unbalanced. I was having a lot more fun during the earlier minutes, when bullets were plentiful and the blood spilled like wine, so I’m not sure if the flow and tone really mesh with the current resource levels. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The more concerning thing, though, is progression. All weapons have individual XP bars, and must be levelled up to particular milestones to unlock different modifications. When you unlock a mod, you then need to spend a currency to actually fit it to the weapon, and each one costs several thousand. I can’t help but look at the entire armoury and envision the hundreds and hundreds of hours I’d need to sink into Toxic Commando to achieve a decently functioning, varied loadout. It’s the sort of system that funnels you into picking a single favourite, rather than encouraging you to constantly switch between missions. This, combined with a trio of different currencies and palette-swap character skins, has me a little suspicious that the sludge of live-service has tainted something I’ve otherwise had a pretty good blast with. But these grindy woes can also be found in Saber’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, and they didn’t stop it from being one of my favourite games of 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say I’m expecting John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando to have anywhere near the same impact Space Marine had. But, provided the full game has a solid range of missions that genuinely prove replayable, I do think the strong shooting and entertaining enemies have a decent enough chance to secure it a home among friendship groups who’d happily re-watch gloopy ‘80s horror over and over until the VHS wears out. Whether they’ll ever unlock the attachments they want for their favourite weapons… well, we’ll have to wait to find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-puts-an-80s-horror-spin-on-left-4-dead]]></content:encoded>
