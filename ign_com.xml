From a $12 power bank perfect for your Nintendo Switch 2 to a hefty Skytech gaming PC loaded with AMD’s latest hardware, there’s a little something for everyone. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vinyl collectors can also look forward to Woodkid’s emotionally rich <em>Death Stranding 2</em> soundtrack, while digital deal hunters should check out the IGN Live 2025 Bundle. Eight well-reviewed PC games for just $22.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hulu + Live TV Free Trial</h2><div catalogid="77f3624c-3861-436e-b835-55c123112a11" id="216770"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hulu + Live TV <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-get-hulu-plus-live-tv-free-trial">offers a three-day free trial</a> that allows you to take the live TV streaming service for a spin. This is one of the overall <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-streaming-service-free-trials">best streaming free trials</a> because it gets you a bundle of services. It is quite a bit shorter than the standard Hulu free trial of 30 days, but it's a great way to test it out over the weekend.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Final Fantasy x Secret Lair</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While boosters, Commander decks, and a new Starter Kit are up for grabs (if you can find them in stock), collectors will be most drawn to the highly coveted Secret Lair drops. Despite selling out instantly via Wizards of the Coast, these limited-edition mini-sets (Game Over, Weapons, and Grimoire) are still available through third-party platforms like TCGPlayer, though you’ll be paying premium prices well above the original $30–$40 MSRP. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each set features beautifully reimagined cards themed around iconic Final Fantasy characters and spells: the Weapons drop highlights legendary arms like Cloud’s Buster Sword and Tidus’s Brotherhood, Grimoire centers on magic-wielders like Vivi and Aerith, and Game Over pays tribute to villains with cards like Spira’s Punishment and Meteorfall. All sets come in standard and foil variants, with Japanese versions available as well. If you’re considering adding these to your collection, be sure to check listings carefully and be prepared for markups ranging from $70 to $150 or more.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Final Fantasy Chase Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's insane how quickly these cards have climbed in value just days after release, and I can guarantee you (almost) that they won't be coming down any time soon. If you fancy saving some money ripping packs of MTG FF, just buy the card you want on TCGPlayer instead and save a fortune.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Buy MTG: Final Fantasy</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's finally here, Magic the Gathering: Final Fantasy is out in the wild. If you got a preorder for MSRP, well played, but many TCG and Final Fantasy fans missed out. Fear not, there's still some options on sealed products available right now, including options from the secondary market with TCG Player which is around the same or lower than the pricing of big box retailers right now.
</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Restock Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Checking these prices against TCG Player secondary market values, a lot of these products aren't far off the mark. Make no mistake, they're still way off MSRP, but finding Pokémon products on shelves that haven't been marked up past the point of anyone caring is a positive. Still refusing to pay over MSRP for new sets? Well played, I'm proud of you. Here's some single card highlights for you to shuffle through instead. Spoiler, there's plenty of deals to be had.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Singles Are On The Rise (Again)</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to stick a pin on Destined Rivals single card values right now, and the dips in value seem to match the little bits of stock distributors release to stores. Looking at the tracking charts for each of these cards, we can see mostly plummets from day one, then either upticks or cards for sale that exceed the original value at launch. It's crazy, but we now know how low these cards can go. Sure there's always attempts at market manipulation, but I wouldn't buy any cards on the rise right now.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">The Most Expensive Pokémon Cards In Packs RIGHT NOW</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're not talking about vintage or out of print sets, all of these are incredible chase cards you can pull from booster packs available now. You can probably put money on their value going up as soon as their respective sets go out of print. If you don't want to spend mega money ripping open packs, market values on these single cards are quite reasonable for the most part..</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Sealed Stock</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wew're look to market values for Destined Rivals at the moment, seeing as big box stores are either fresh out of stock or charging over MSRP and what they're worth on the secondary market. So here's the full lineup to pop on your shelf or rip open like THAT Tyranitar. If you know you know.</p><p id="skytech-king-95-gaming-pc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Skytech King 95 Gaming PC">Skytech King 95 Gaming PC</h2></p><div catalogid="12468fbf-8990-4f79-9cda-997cbff2a2aa" id="223214"><div id="223214" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Skytech King 95 Gaming PC</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Skytech King 95 Gaming PC delivers serious performance for gamers ready to step into high-end territory without going overboard.
