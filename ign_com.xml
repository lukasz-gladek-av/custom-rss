The update, Horizon Realms, will include four new cars, a new racetrack layout at the Horizon Stadium, and a mixture of returning environments selected from past community favorites.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We learned last month that Forza Horizon 5 on PS5 will include all the same content as the Xbox and PC versions, including Car Packs, the Hot Wheels expansion, and the Rally Adventure expansion, will all be included too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Forza Horizon 5 is just one of several previously Xbox-exclusive games that's headed to PlayStation, with Sea of Thieves and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-finally-gets-a-release-date-for-xbox-and-playstation-gamescom-2024">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> preceding it.

At the time, our reviewer said it's "the result of a racing studio at the peak of its craft and the best open-world racing game Iâ€™ve ever played."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
