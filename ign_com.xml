This was thought to have made Silent Hill 2 remake the fastest-selling Silent Hill game ever, but Konami has yet to rubber stamp that potential record.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since its release, Silent Hill 2 has received a multitude of accolades including several ‘perfect’ review scores, multiple award wins and nominations cementing itself as a timeless entry in the horror video game genre,” Konami said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review"><u>Silent Hill 2 remake review</u></a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Silent Hill 2 is a great way to visit – or revisit – one of the most dread-inducing destinations in the history of survival horror.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sales success of the Silent Hill 2 remake will perhaps embolden Konami’s plans for the franchise, which have ramped up significantly in recent years. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f"><u>Silent Hill f</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-townfall"><u>Silent Hill: Townfall</u></a> are both still in the works, but perhaps Konami will also continue to remake past Silent Hill games. There's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-movie-first-look-pyramid-head"><u>a film adaptation of Silent Hill 2</u></a> coming, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/early-silent-hill-2-remake-mods-remove-hair-sheen-the-fog-and-even-turn-the-game-into-sunny-hills"><u>Modders are doing eye-catching things with the Silent Hill 2 remake on PC</u></a>, too, including removing hair sheen, the game’s famous fog, and even turning it into Sunny Hills.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Silent Hill 2 remake features several new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/silent-hill-2-remake/Puzzle_Guide"><u>puzzles</u></a> and redesigned maps, so if you need help navigating through it all, head to our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/silent-hill-2-remake/Walkthrough"><u>Silent Hill 2 Walkthrough Hub</u></a>.
