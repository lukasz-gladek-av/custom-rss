It’s set for October 23 at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm UK time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This one's even longer than the 45-minute Kirby Air Riders Direct we saw in August. Expect roughly 60 minutes of information on the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, Nintendo said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">August’s showcase divulged a release date for Sakurai’s new game, offered a first look at gameplay, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sakurai-says-kirby-air-riders-is-basically-mario-kart-in-extremely-smash-bros-style-direct">saw the legendary developer compare Kirby Air Riders to Mario Kart in what was a Smash Bros.-style Direct</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"You might be asking yourself if it's basically Mario Kart," Sakurai said. "You race and battle with familiar characters around courses with different features, or so they say. Ok, so it basically is like Mario Kart. I even mentioned this when I received the request to make the game. I asked them if they still wanted to do it. But as fans of the original know...the appeal of the game is not actually the races!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby Air Riders is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-kirby-air-riders-release-date"><u>out on November 20, 2025</u></a> for the Nintendo Switch 2 and features a wide roster of Kirby characters including Waddle Dee, King Dedede, Gooey, Chef Kawasaki, Metaknight, and more.

"I’ll have something a bit more put together to say in the not too distant future, so please stay tuned." He than laughed: "It might be Nier, it might not be Nier. That’s about all I can say for now.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/21/gettyimages-477373540-1761049766030.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yoko Taro says beware of items that claim to include his signature.

To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen. It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously, they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa.
