You can purchase any of the three covers for $14.99 each on Amazon now.</p><div id="235338"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235338" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>TIME Lugia and Ho-Oh Cover</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The special oversized issue of TIME Magazine takes readers on a deep dive through Pokémon's history, analyzing its rise to iconic status, how it's garnered such staying power, and even gives a few tricks and tips on how to get better at playing Pokémon GO. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn't just focus on the video games, either; you'll get a detailed retrospective of the Pokémon anime and its many spin-offs, as well as education on the Pokémon trading card game and how to navigate the secondary market.</p></div><div id="235355"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235355" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>TIME Charizard Cover</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With Pokémon celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, fans are expecting big things.

Those games desperately need better accessibility. </p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/time-magazine-is-celebrating-pokmons-30th-anniversary-with-three-exclusive-covers]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-this-weeks-playstation-state-of-play</link>
            <guid>1432702</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A lengthy, 60-plus minutes Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-state-of-play-broadcast-for-this-week"><u>State of Play is heading our way this Thursday, February 12</u></a>, and promises new looks at “third-party and indie games headed to PS5, along with the latest from teams at PlayStation Studios.” So, what upcoming games can we expect to see fresh reveals for and gameplay of? Well, here’s what we think is likely to show up, as well as a few out-there guesses.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Exclusives</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Seeing as it's shaping up to be PlayStation’s biggest game of 2026, you’d perhaps have expected Wolverine to show up in Thursday’s stream. Well, a late spanner has been thrown into the works via Insomniac’s official X account, which claims that we won’t be seeing any more of its latest Marvel game until “Spring 2026”. Last time I checked, February was in Winter, so maybe we’ll have to wait a little longer.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Spring 2026.</p>— Insomniac Games (@insomniacgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/2021332733998612529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 10, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">At the last State of Play, back in September 2025, Insomniac Games gave us a first look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine"><u>Marvel’s Wolverine</u></a> in action. As one of Sony’s tentpole releases for this year, it certainly wouldn’t be a shock to see some more X-Men gameplay, as well as perhaps a release date for Logan’s latest adventure. Could we also catch a glimpse of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-kind-of-fancy-lawyer-lingo-marvels-wolverine-developer-just-dropped-a-big-tease-for-another-hero-fans-believe"><u>Daredevil</u></a>, who has been teased to be making an appearance, too? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation Studio’s first big exclusive of the year comes in the shape of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon"><u>Marathon</u></a>, Bungie’s extraction shooter, which will be looking to emulate the success of last year’s Arc Raiders. It’s been a bumpy road for the Destiny developer, such as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-developer-bungie-launches-thorough-review-after-once-again-being-found-to-have-used-work-from-an-uncredited-artist"><u>plagiarism scandal</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-delayed-as-bungie-promises-to-reveal-new-release-date-this-fall"><u>poor reception to its alpha</u></a>, but this week’s State of Play will be one of the last chances for it to convince players to hop into its world on March 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in Spring, we have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/saros"><u>Saros</u></a>, Housemarque’s follow-up to Returnal, which will be dropping on April 30. We’ve seen it pop up regularly on recent State of Play streams, and it would make perfect sense to see it here, too, seeing as we’re only 10 weeks away from launch.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another PS5 console exclusive is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls"><u>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</u></a>, the upcoming superhero fighting game from Guilty Gear Strive developer Arc System Works. Due for release this year, the flashy-looking fighter suffered from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-roster-count-leaked-ahead-of-playstation-state-of-play"><u>an unfortunate leak earlier this week</u></a> that revealed a few key details about the game, such as the size of its roster. It would not be a shock to see some of this information officially confirmed as fact on Thursday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5 console exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phantom-blade-zero"><u>Phantom Blade Zero</u></a> is a hotly anticipated wuxia action RPG coming from Chinese developer S-Game. The lead character is called Soul, so you can probably guess what genre this project borrows heavily from, too. It’s all looking very impressive, and maybe we’ll get yet another look at it in action this week ahead of its September 9 launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the freshly revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game-for-ps5-and-pc"><u>Horizon Hunters Gathering</u></a>, yet another spin-off of the mechanical monster-hunting series created by Guerrilla Games. A 3-player live-service co-op action game, it's getting its first playtest at the end of this month, so, again, it wouldn’t be a surprise if we were to get a further look at some gameplay in this State of Play.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unveiled at The Game Awards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/4loop"><u>4:Loop</u></a> is a PS5 and PC exclusive that appears to infuse some roguelike elements with the co-op shooting of games like Helldivers and Left 4 Dead. That makes more sense when you consider that Left 4 Dead creator Mike Booth is behind the project, working with Bad Robot Games, the video game wing of film director J.J. Abrams' production company. No release date has been given yet, but playtesting will start soon, with maybe a timing for that revealed at this State of Play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One exclusive that we don’t think is coming this year, but would certainly love to see more of, is Naughty Dog’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet"><u>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</u></a>. The Last of Us and Uncharted studio’s upcoming sci-fi action-adventure has gone very quiet since its initial reveal back at the 2024 Game Awards. So, is it time for a deeper look into what this new world has to offer? Let’s hope so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what the other PlayStation Studios are up to, your guess is as good as mine, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t expect one or two surprise reveals or updates. This State of Play stream is over an hour long, after all, so surely there’s something brand-new in there? Perhaps a look at the next project from God of War developer Sony Santa Monica, or a look into the world of Ghost of Yotei: Legends from Sucker Punch? Maybe the time is right for a first sighting of Gran Turismo 8, or an update on the development of Haven Studios’ Fairgames — if we don’t see this one soon, we’ll really start to get worried about it. Then there are two of Sony’s most creative studios, Media Molecule and Team Asobi. We’ve certainly been waiting a lot longer for a follow-up to Dreams than we have Astro Bot, but you never know what’s been going on behind those doors...</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Multiplatform</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Will we see GTA 6 at this Sony State of Play? No. I will eat my whole fist if we do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a fair few other exciting games that we wouldn’t put body parts on the line for in terms of their likelihood, though. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem"><u>Resident Evil Requiem</u></a> is imminent, so now seems like as good a time as any to show us one last slice of Leon Kennedy action before the big day on February 27. Sticking with survival horror, Konami has curiously announced a Silent Hill stream will be taking place just two hours after the State of Play. Is this a signal that a more in-depth look at a new Silent Hill game will be at that show, following its reveal just minutes prior as part of PlayStation’s stream? Perhaps this week is when we’ll see Bloober Team’s remake of the original in the series, or – more likely – our first proper look at the Annapurna-published Silent Hill: Townfall, which was first announced in 2022 and has been MIA since.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back at Capcom briefly, and you can likely expect to see something from one of, if not both, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pragmata"><u>Pragmata </u></a>and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/onimusha-way-of-the-sword"><u>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</u></a>. Final Fantasy 7 remake director, Naoki Hamaguchi, recently teased that Square Enix will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-will-share-more-updates-than-ever-before-on-final-fantasy-7-remake-project-this-year-says-director"><u>“share more updates than ever before”</u></a> about the project this year. Does that mean a potential reveal of the third part in the modernised RPG trilogy will happen at this State of Play? Or could we get an Intergrade-style bridging chapter as DLC for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, before we get too sidetracked, let’s stick with games closer on the horizon, such as Hitman developer IO Interactive's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light"><u>007 First Light</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight"><u>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</u></a> from Warner Bros. Games. Both are coming this May, and their respective developers could share further info on Thursday. Before those, though, March will bring with it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crimson-desert"><u>Crimson Desert</u></a>, Pearl Abyss’ ambitious open-world action-adventure that looks set to push the PS5 to its limits. No stranger to a trailer, we can likely expect it to turn up here, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for later in the year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra"><u>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</u></a> recently shifted out of its original window of early 2026 to “beyond early 2026”, so your guess is as good as mine as to when we’ll be playing Amy Hennig’s Captain America and Black Panther in World War 2 story. Legendary PlayStation hero Lara Croft will be returning in a “reimagining” of her original game, titled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis"><u>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</u></a>, and Finnish developer Remedy is back with another entry in its connected universe, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control-resonant"><u>Control: Resonant</u></a>. Also announced at The Game Awards was the pleasantly surprising <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-galactic-racer"><u>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</u></a> from the makers of Burnout and Need For Speed that is scheduled to drop in 2026. All of these are possibilities.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for indies, outside of the announcement of a PS5 version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hades-ii"><u>Hades 2</u></a>, there are a few destined for PlayStation that I’d personally love to see more of on Thursday. Namely, Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur’s coming of age story <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mixtape-preview-its-all-about-the-music-in-the-idyllic-90s"><u>Mixtape</u></a>, old-school cartoon-inspired shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mouse-pi-for-hire"><u>Mouse P.I. For Hire</u></a>, and Japanese convenience store sim <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/inkonbini-one-store-many-stories"><u>inKONBINI: One Store. Many Stories</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What game are you most looking forward to seeing more of at this week’s Sony State of Play?

            <guid>1432696</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Playground Games gave us a first look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground"><u>gameplay from its Fable reboot</u></a> earlier this year in January’s Xbox Developer Direct, and among its viewers was the series’ original creator, Peter Molyneux. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN recently spoke to the former Lionhead Studios developer in anticipation of his new God game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/masters-of-albion">Masters of Albion</a>, and took the opportunity to ask for his thoughts on what he saw from this new incarnation of Fable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“When I was watching the Fable trailer, I just felt myself tearing up”, reveals Molyneux. “I know that I could probably be slaughtered for saying that, but I am someone who cries frequently, and I felt incredibly emotional, and the reason I felt emotional was: F*** me. This thing that we created, it's going to live, it’s going to carry on. This world, which we loved creating so much, and other people loved, has a life.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And for me, the saddest thing would be to see it diminish, which is one of the reasons I'm really going back to God games. So that was the overall emotion. I thought it was really smart of them to retell Fable 1 rather than have the burden of continuing the Fable story. I loved seeing some of those references. I thought it was super smart to have the kid’s family turn to stone. I thought that was really smart. And so those were all the plus points.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But… there’s always a but. Although there was plenty that the series’ original creator enjoyed in Playground’s grand unveiling, it didn’t completely hit the nail on the head for Molyneux — with the game's tone and visual design not quite to his tastes.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fable Screenshots - Xbox Developer Direct 2026</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I mean, if I was critical, which I think you want me to be, there was a slight antiseptic feel about it," Molyneux states. “But I mean, they've got months and months to build in that character and almost that dirtiness that you want in the world. I never thought Fable as being clean and all the angles being sharp and defined. It's more chaotic. It's more what Old England probably used to be, which was not straight lines, the place, it's more crinkling, and all the buckle belts on people are ridiculously large, and the boots and the hands ridiculously large because that is part of the character. So there’s a little bit more of that character, which I would probably foolishly and ridiculously ask for.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But these minor quibbles with the current aesthetic certainly aren’t getting in the way of Peter looking forward to getting his hands on it when it arrives later this year. When asked if he plans to play Fable, he replied: “Absolutely. For sure.

            <guid>1432690</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's all allowing players that freedom,” says Peter Molyneux. “And that's what we've been exploring with Masters of Albion.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The god game thrives on freedom, and, arguably, is nothing without it. No one knows that better than Peter Molyneux. The lead developer of landmark god games such as Dungeon Keeper, Populous, and Black &amp; White, he’s returning to those roots after years away with Masters of Albion, a self-declared “culmination” of all his work to date that blends those god game greats with other milestones from a long career that also birthed Fable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Freedom very much is the word I heard most often when speaking with Molyneux recently. His upcoming project, developed at his studio 22Cans, is not only inspired by his own vaunted library, but also by modern masterpieces that have reframed our understanding of player freedom. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I look at the true greats, things like Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom”, Molyneux reveals. “I wouldn't dare to say that our games are anywhere close to as good as those games, but I'm inspired by the fluidity, the seamlessness of those experiences. You're not going through level-up screens. It is just seamless. I'm really inspired by that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest two Zelda games are heralded for how reactive their versions of Hyrule are, and how their systems beg to be experimented with. You can see a similar ambition in the latest gameplay trailer for Masters of Albion, which showcases the numerous ways you can interact with the world of Albion. You can approach from many different perspectives, from the more traditional city building and infrastructure management layer, to RPG-esque missions full of sword and shield combat, to running the rule over its open world via a massive hand that floats over your townspeople as if The Addams Family’s Thing has risen to deity status.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The hand really is the star of the show”, says Molyneux. “Giving players the ability to reach into a world, to manipulate things, to move things around, to combine things in ways that we may have never thought of is incredibly alluring for me and really fascinating to experiment with. And the interesting thing is, the more we develop this idea and the more we create it, the more other ideas come around the hand. There are some real surprises in that thing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hand, of course, has played a starring role in Molyneux’s Black &amp; White games, but revisiting the concept has allowed 22cans to add a number of new surprises. Among them, I’m teased, is the ability to contort its four fingers, thumb, and palm into whichever shape you choose, and each and every occupant of Albion will react expressively to that. I’m not saying that you might want to raise only your middle digit up when confronting a tiny person who refuses to behave the way you’d like them to, but you do really want to, don’t you?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are other, more playful ways to annoy your devoted townsfolk. Want to make a laughing stock of one of your villagers? Then have him parade around the streets dressed in armour made of sausages, created through the detailed factory system that allows you to substitute chainlink for chains of pork. This playfulness and sense of humour are things we’ve come to expect from Molyneux’s games, but crucially, all of these quirks play into Masters of Albion’s world systems, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only a flicking off device, the hand also plays into the surprisingly deep city-building side of things. This isn’t your standard “drop a mine near a valuable source of ore” situation, but one that lets you express yourself in the architectural design and colour of your buildings. While a snap-together block building system allows you to create towers and factories and housing complexes of your own design, be aware that your arrangements have consequences, including shifting your moral alignment — something familiar to any fan of the Black &amp; White series. But there will also be other, more surprising consequences that evoke the odd systems of Lionhead’s Fable days, such as the rather ominous-sounding arrival of a housing inspector…</p><p data-cy="paragraph"> Molyneux explains that choices like colour and shape can cause a property inspection, and while he’s careful not to spoil the consequences of a failing grade, it sounds like something worth avoiding. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">”You want to be careful that you don't trigger the housing inspector, because when [he] comes and he doesn't like that you've created a slum where everyone's packed together… he does not like that sort of stuff,” he teases.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Masters of Albion Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While things like the housing inspector will take time to occur in-world, Molyneux also wants to ensure that there’s instantaneous fun to be found in designing towns and individual buildings. He’s doing away with the genre staple construction timers, instead getting straight into the buffs and nerfs each new block might bring.</p><p>I really want it to feel more like Lego than anything else, that immediacy of what you are building.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I love playing city-building games, but I always get frustrated that I have to build a mine here and that's it,” Molyneux states, clearly frustrated by the time spent waiting for resources to start flowing. “[In Masters of Albion] you can build anything you want, anywhere you want, and it works immediately. There are no wait timers. If you've got a farm and you've got a mill and you've got a factory, you can say, ‘I'm just going to put them all into one building’ and you can make this thing that looks like Howl's Moving Castle with all these workstations for your workers, and it will work as you are building it. You don't have to wait for bricks to come to build it. I really want it to feel more like Lego than anything else, that immediacy of what you are building.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Howl’s Moving Castle, there’s nothing rooting you to the spot. “You could go back to your original town, which is Oakridge, and you could say, ‘Do you know what? I'm going to move the whole of Oakridge to Wyrmscar, so I'm going to have everyone live in Wyrmscar.’ So this all comes back to god games being about freedom.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But that freedom also needs direction, and that’s where Masters of Albion’s story comes into play. Launching into early access on April 22 will be chapter one of a planned trilogy, for which a full “epic” story is planned. While tales will play out in the world as you (literally) build it by hand, it appears the main thrust of its narrative structure can be found when Masters of Albion morphs more into a Fable-like shape, as you possess its heroes and venture out on RPG-like quests, slashing enemies down with a sword or turning them to dust with magic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the things that we haven't done a good job of explaining is that there is a narrative story”, admits Molyneux. “It’s a huge epic story that winds through the entirety of the game. You saw a couple of times in the gameplay trailer that when the gold scroll was clicked on, that's a quest. If it's a gold scroll, it's on the golden line. It's a story quest. If it's a silver scroll, it's an optional quest.</p><p>We've been inspired by the open-world nature of Fable 2 and Fable 3.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And all those quests, they give you more stuff”, he continues. “They may give you one of the currencies in the game, they may give you more blocks that you can build with, they may give you more parts that you can design things with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You'd be travelling through a land in Fable, and you'd see a chest, and you go and open that chest,” Molyneux explains. “We've got that in here. You can go and open a chest just like in Fable, you can stumble upon a scene that is playing out, and you can get involved in that scene. And so we've been inspired by the open-world nature of Fable 2 and Fable 3.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Masters of Albion does sound ambitious, but ambition is something we’ve learned to take as a given from Molyneux’s work over the years. Whether these many complex, intertwining systems all come together and work in harmony is, of course, yet to be seen. I’m hopeful, though, because without big swings like Masters of Albion, genres such as the god game would be left to stagnate. That’s something Molyneux is highly aware of, due to the complex nature of their conception.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's very hard, in my experience, to sit down and say, ‘Right, I'm going to design a god game.’ Because so much of it is the visceral feeling of connecting these gameplay systems together. It is a very frightening design process that you'd think, ‘Oh, I wish I could just make a first-person shooter. I know what a first-person shooter is.’ It's a terrifying development process to make a god game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Masters of Albion will be released into early access on April 22, 2026, and is available to wishlist now on Steam.
