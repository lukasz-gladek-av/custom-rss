Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you probably already know that. What you might not know is that Sega has four games coming to the console, three of which are available now and one with a release date fast approaching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This <a href="https://www.sega.com/nintendo-switch-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>batch of games</u></a> brings some titles to the Switch for the first time and covers a range of genres. From pure action to platforming to puzzles, there’s a little something for everyone, whether you’re a solo gamer or want something to play with friends. If you’re one of the many people who has a shiny new Switch 2, here are some options to get the most out of it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/31/switch-2-pre-order-970x250-english-updated-1748650575893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the definitive edition of the Yakuza series’ origin story, loaded with new content that makes it a standout of the Switch 2’s third-party launch lineup. If you’ve never had the chance to dive into the Yakuza series, this is the best starting point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as yakuza Kazuma Kiryu and former yakuza (also current cabaret club manager) Goro Majima in a crime drama exploring the decadence and danger of 1988 Japan. Both characters have three unique fighting styles that you can switch between on the fly while making use of your surroundings by turning street signs, bicycles, motorcycles, and traffic cones into makeshift weapons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Yakuza 0 isn’t all about cracking skulls. When you want to take a break from fighting, you can live it up on the neon-lit streets of Japan and enjoy a variety of optional side content: over-the-top substories, karaoke and dancing rhythm games, bowling, and even a full-blown retro Sega arcade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Director’s Cut adds English voice acting and more than 25 minutes of new cutscenes, providing deeper insight into character backstories and key moments of the main story. It also adds a new online mode called Red Light Raid, where you can join forces with up to three teammates to take on hordes of enemies while fighting the clock to face down a final boss. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Defeating enemies and winning raids gets you money to unlock and upgrade characters — there are 60 in all, each with their own health, defense, and attack stats. An online leaderboard will track your lifetime earnings, so you and your friends can fight your way to the top.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut is available now for the Switch 2. For more info and trailers, visit <a href="https://www.sega.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza/yakuza-0-directors-cut" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>the official website</u></a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a remastered version of the 2006 action RPG that’s part of the Devil Summoner series, a spinoff from Shin Megami Tensei, and it marks Raidou’s debut on a Nintendo console. You play as a demon-summoning detective protecting the streets of an alternate version of 1931 Tokyo, where the Taisho era is still ongoing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all begins with a mysterious schoolgirl who asks Raidou to kill her, but she’s kidnapped by armored soldiers before she can explain why. On top of that, demonic incursions are on the rise across the city. You’ll need to make use of Raidou’s ability to capture and fuse demons as you try to solve this strange case that will lead him to discover a sinister conspiracy that threatens all of Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remaster adds demons that weren’t in the original, for a total of more than 120 this time around. They can fight beside you in combat but also join you on the field, and you can use their unique abilities to affect the environment and help solve cases. Some demons let you read minds, others light up areas to help find hidden objects, while others can freeze water or fly over impassable areas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also several new improvements to visuals, audio, and performance. Characters that are part of the main storyline now have full voice acting, bringing them to life in a new way. The graphics have been upgraded across the board, the UI has been revamped, and you can save your game from anywhere on the field. Plus, the battle system has been overhauled. You can now fully control the camera during combat, navigating menus has been streamlined, you can command multiple demons, and Raidou has new abilities. If you want to hear more about all of this from someone who’s gotten to play it, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytUPOBBt4Q&amp;t=4793s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>listen to IGN’s Michael Higham discuss it</u></a> as part of a recent episode of Unlocked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raidou Remastered releases on Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, PS4/5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on June 19. There will be five DLC packs (and a bundle of all five packs in one) also available at release, and you can get the cosmetic item Raidou Glasses for preordering either the digital or physical version of the base game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you <a href="https://cp.sega-account.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>sign up for a Sega Account</u></a>, you can claim* the Survival Pack Light Gear for free between June 19 and July 31, 2025. The pack comes with these in-game items: Soma x2 (fully restores Raidou’s HP and MAG), Survival Erudition x5 (automatically revives Raidou one time with full HP, but can’t be used in “Sleuth” difficulty).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>*Available in select regions. Regional age restrictions may apply.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information about the game, its characters, and where to preorder it, you can visit <a href="https://www.sega.com/raidou/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>the official website</u></a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Sonic x Shadow Generations</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a two-games-in-one package that combines Shadow Generations with a remastered version of Sonic Generations. IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review"><u>gave the original release a 9</u></a> and said it “takes an already excellent game and spring jumps it to new heights at a blistering pace by doubling up the campaign length with creative level design, fantastic bosses, plenty of collectibles, and an appreciable graphical upgrade.” In the Switch 2 release, those upgrades are pushed even further. Both games have been optimized and enhanced for Nintendo’s new console, with improvements to resolution and graphics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The games play similarly, but with some marked differences. Sonic Generations sees you switch between “classic” and “modern” versions of Sonic, with gameplay inspired by different eras of the franchise. “Classic” is purely side-scrolling, like the original Sonic games of the ’90s. “Modern” plays more like the 2000s era, with a mixture of side-scrolling and third-person. You use a main hub to access each level, which all have a “classic” section and “modern” section. Some of the levels are more than just inspired by previous eras, they’re full-on remakes of iconic levels from the series — like the classic Green Hill Zone from the original Sonic and City Escape from Sonic Adventure 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the name implies, Shadow Generations stars Shadow the Hedgehog as the protagonist. It also has two sections of each level, one side-scrolling and one 3D, but Shadow has different powers than his blue counterpart. As he defeats enemies, he fills a gauge in the corner of the screen. Once full, you can activate Chaos Control, which stops time, freezes objects, and opens alternate paths. You can also discover new abilities known as Doom Powers, which unlock new attacks and abilities that drastically alter Shadow's platforming capabilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upgraded version of Sonic x Shadow Generations was part of the Switch 2’s launch lineup and is available now. For more details on the story and to see it in action, check out <a href="https://www.sega.com/sonic-the-hedgehog/sonic-x-shadow-generations" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>the official website</u></a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This unique puzzle game lands on Switch 2 as an exclusive, bringing a ton of new features along with it in Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S, which combines two beloved series into one and lets you choose how to play. You can play it like Tetris, placing blocks and eliminating them by filling lines across the screen. Or like Puyo Puyo, eliminating colored blobs by matching colors and setting up combos. Or you can combine the two in crossover game modes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the exclusives: an all-new game mode and features you can only experience on the Nintendo Switch 2 that take advantage of the new hardware in fun ways. The Puyo Tetris® Doubles mode lets you compete in 2v2 battles with pairs using the same board, allowing you to set up devastating combos. Gameshare lets you use one copy of the game to play with up to three of your friends from anywhere around the world, camera functionality lets you put yourself into the game and become the background of a stage or the game board through a live video feed, and there’s also mouse control support using the Joy-Con 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, there’s an extensive single-player adventure and 12 game modes that can be played solo or in local and online multiplayer. Plus, there’s a roster of 40 playable characters, including Sonic the Hedgehog, each with their own unique stats and abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S was also a Switch 2 launch title and is out now. You can find more details and order it on <u>the official website</u>.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
