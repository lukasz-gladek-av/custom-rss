            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been four years since Nintendo brought the first batch of Nintendo 64 games to its Nintendo Switch Online service, now redubbed Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Classics. For someone who started his games media career covering N64 games, this modern take on Nintendo’s legendary Virtual Console era was a very welcome addition. I ended up playing through a few of the games over the months that followed and was surprised how well some of them aged (special shoutout to Rare’s Banjo games)!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not all sunshine, of course. The games aren’t running natively and may not feel as snappy as you remember them. Some early emulation challenges, like Ocarina of Time’s fog rendering, were addressed pretty quickly, even if some others still linger (F-Zero X is still not as we remember it). And while there are many all-time classics to be found in the emulated library, I would’ve honestly expected a bigger lineup by now with a few more first-party hits as well as some third-party gems that have firmly entered the forgotten gems realm. Which means, Nintendo Classics is a convenient and cost-effective solution to relive the N64 age, but not a perfect one. </p><p id="the-analogue-3d"><h2 data-cy="title1" data-toc-title="The Analogue 3D">Analogue 3D: Nintendo 64's Digital Offspring</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter the Analogue 3D, a modern – but costly – take on the Nintendo 64 hardware. See <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/analogue3d-review">Seth’s review for more</a>:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not familiar with the company, it’s known for making extremely capable high-end solutions to play classic games on modern screens, such as the Analogue Duo (PC Engine/TurboGrafx), the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/16/analogue-super-nt-review">Super NT (SNES)</a>, Mega NT ( Genesis/Mega Drive), the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/analogue-pocket-review">Analogue Pocket</a> (all Game Boy systems – with adapters for Game Gear, NGPC, Lynx, and more), and now, the $270 Analogue 3D, capable of bringing both NTSC and PAL games to 4K screens, lag-free, and with additional bells and whistles, like CRT-style display options, overclocking, and VFR. It’s not a replacement for the Switch consoles’ ability to emulate Nintendo 64 on the go, but for purists who have or are willing to build a sizable N64 cartridge collection and want the games to feel and look as good (or better) as they remember, it’s surely the best way to play them on modern screens. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/22/analogue3d-white-1763781056003.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">My Analogue 3D in white (it also comes in black for a more classic look.)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I preordered one day one, mostly because I anticipated some major N64 games that I still own to never come to the Switch service – though I’ll concede that Nintendo has surprised me before. For starters, I did not have the Japan-only Custom Robo and Custom Robo V2 on my Switch Online bingo card. Perhaps there’s more where that came from? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">People interested in game preservation usually know their way around a classic gaming library and if you’re part of the Analogue 3D club, you likely have some N64 carts at home already. But as someone who reviewed Nintendo 64 games for a living some three decades ago, I humbly present this non-exhaustive list of personal favorites that are worth going back to and AREN’T yet – and in some cases never will be – on Nintendo’s service.   </p><p id="10-n64-must-plays"><h2 data-cy="title1" data-toc-title="10 N64 Must-Plays"><strong>10 Nintendo 64 Must-Plays</strong></h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s kick it off with 10 must-plays, in alphabetical order. I've included IGN's Top 25 N64 games at the bottom of this article -- but these picks and other picks in this column are specifically games you can't get yet play on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Beetle Adventure Racing</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I wrote a whole column about this one as well, but EA’s Battle Adventure Racing is more than just a – now – obscure entry in the Need for Speed series. It’s a genuinely good racer in which the hunt for its imaginative shortcuts is as entertaining as the actual racing action. Given that the VW Beetle car license comes with strings attached (VW isn’t making Beetles anymore and may not be motivated to rubberstamp an emulated re-release), the Analogue 3D is surely the best way to play it today! </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/22/bar-title-1697833070747-1763780192081.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Beetle Adventure Racing for N64 (1999)</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Read my column, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/raising-the-bar">Raising the BAR</a>, for more on the history of Beetle Adventure Racing -- and its canceled sequel.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Conker’s Bad Fur Day</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Conker’s Bad Fur Day didn’t age as well as Rare’s best platformers, Banjo Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie, partially because of its dated humor and references, but it’s still a great time. I actually played the original saccharine Conker’s game before it was retooled into the M-rated adventure we all know and love today, and historic significance of that “design 180” aside, there still isn’t anything as outrageously funny as the Great Mighty Poo boss battle. Even without the context of Conker’s roots. Perhaps replaying it will finally purge the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2DogLLDV_0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ugas’ chant</a> from my brain, too. Note also that the Conker: Live and Reloaded remake is playable on modern Xbox consoles via backwards compatibility. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Diddy Kong Racing</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s very strange Nintendo added Rare’s much worse Jet Force Gemini to Nintendo Switch Online before adding Diddy Kong Racing, but perhaps the combination of Microsoft-owned game code with Nintendo characters made it a much trickier title to negotiate a re-release contract for. Or maybe it’s still coming. Regardless, Diddy Kong Racing merged the stylings of Mario Kart and Mario 64 into a racing game with multiple vehicle types and an explorable overworld hub – decades before Mario Kart World. The Analogue 3D even smoothes out some of DKR’s framerate issues thanks to its ability to overclock. Given how long it takes Nintendo to make a new Mario Kart, I’m still hoping we’ll eventually get a true remake or a sequel – but lest you want to risk waiting until you approach Cranky Kong’s age you may want to just revisit the original. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bonus Pick: Goemon's Great Adventure</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami’s been issuing classic game collections left and right, which is why we haven’t seen some of its best classics, like the Castlevania GBA games, on Nintendo's service. Goemon games may be more likely additions, since Konami hasn’t revisited them in a long time, but the fact that the only Mystical Ninja game playable on modern hardware today is the obscure arcade original should tell you something. Though they’re not as good as Goemon’s best outings on SNES, Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon is a surprisingly daring Ocarina of Time-style 3D action adventure – and it came out before Nintendo’s mega hit. Plus, with overclocking, it’s actually much more playable than ever. Great Adventure, on the other hand, is a return to the 2D side-scrolling co-op action that may not be as original, but aged much better. Both are still fun to play. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/22/goemon-peer-1763780089988.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Goemon and Ebisumaru. (Credit: Konami JP 2005)</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">See my column, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/life-and-death-of-the-mystical-ninja?_cache=pass">Life and Death of the Mystical Ninja</a> for more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ogre Battle 64: Person of Lordly Caliber</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I wrote an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forgotten-gems-the-legendary-ogre-battle">entire column</a> about this true gem of strategy RPG and its predecessor, but at the risk of repeating myself: Ogre Battle 64 still rocks. Unfortunately, it’s also exceedingly rare and will cost more than a hundred bucks (without box or manual). If you don’t own it yet, always keep a weather eye out for a copy at the next neighborhood garage sale. See: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forgotten-gems-the-legendary-ogre-battle">Forgotten Gems: The Legendary Ogre Battle</a> for more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rocket: Robot on Wheels</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve probably never heard of Rocket, but its developer’s pedigree has improved a thousand fold since its debut back in 1999. I’ve always had a soft sport for developer Sucker Punch’s inaugural game, but those curious what the people behind Ghost of Yotei, Infamous, and Sly Cooper did before they were famous will find a slower-paced, physics-based puzzle platformer featuring a long-forgotten unicycle robot mascot. Given that Sony owns Sucker Punch and publisher Ubisoft likely let the license lapse, here’s probably your one chance to play it again or for the first time. Criminally underplayed when it first came out, Rocket is worth another look.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Space Station Silicon Valley</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m convinced that DMA’s Space Station Silicon Valley will eventually join the Nintendo Classics lineup – after all, both its publisher, Take Two, and the developer – known now as Rockstar – are still alive and well. But until then, this obscure platform puzzle game is best played on original N64 hardware or the Analogue 3D. Silicon Valley has you switch between a variety of robotic animals to solve increasingly complicated puzzles. It’s odd, funny, and endlessly creative. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Star Wars: Rogue Squadron</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bonus Pick: Star Wars: Battle for Naboo</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s surprising this graphical showcase hasn’t returned to a Nintendo platform given that you can buy the PC port for a few bucks on Steam. Until it does, you could do worse than play the Expansion Pak-enhanced shooter on an Analogue 3D or original hardware today. A technical achievement for its time, Rogue Squadron is still a very playable and fun experience today. I was actually surprised how good it looks compared to pretty much every other N64 game when I plugged it into my Analogue 3D. The Analogue, of course, also supports the high resolution display mode that requires the 4MB Expansion Pak on original hardware. Bonus: try Star Wars: Episode I Battle for Naboo. It may not have the benefit of the more memorable battles from the original trilogy, but it’s a quality shooter in its own right.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Super Smash Bros.</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, I know. It’s insane the original Smash Bros. has not been released on Nintendo 64 Classics. Whatever the reasons, it still feels great and is a wonderful reminder as to how even the biggest hits started small. It’s the weakest game in the series with its limited roster of just 12 characters, but the genius of the series is already on full display here. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">WWF No Mercy</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bonus Picks: WWF Wrestlemania 2000, WCW/NWO: Revenge, WCW vs. NWO: World Tour</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not a wrestling guy, but even I could tell that developer Aki’s run of Nintendo 64 wrestlers was something special. WWF No Mercy was always our internal top pick at IGN64 (we played it for many late, late hours), but any of the four Aki-made games are still worth playing. And given the complications with character and league licenses, the chances of them ever coming to Nintendo’s service are very slim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those 10 picks should be enough to get you started. </p><p id="even-more-n64-picks"><h2 data-cy="title1" data-toc-title="Even More N64 Picks">Even More N64 Picks for Your Analogue 3D</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here are a few more games worth checking out, based either on gameplay quality or historical significance, as noted:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bakuretsu Muteki Bangai-O</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Inferior to the Dreamcast version, but still a great example of what made Treasure’s games such rare delights, Bangai-O has you steer a tiny flying mech through a maze filled with enemies and relentlessly blast the opposition. Only released in Japan in limited numbers, it’s so ridiculously expensive to buy for N64, it would be really nice to get a digital rerelease.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">BattleTanx and BattleTanx: Global Assault</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo 64 was <strong>the</strong> multiplayer console of the ‘90s – but some of us kept playing four-player split-screen years afterwards, too. Stemming from failed console-maker 3DO, the two BattleTanx games were lesser known, but managed to serve up such addictive tank PVP gameplay, we ended up playing it almost as much as GoldenEye. Sadly, 3DO went under before they managed to pull off a hat trick. Prism Entertainment snapped up the license and maintains the trademarks for BattleTanx, but hasn’t done anything with them. Might as well grab the carts for cheap at a garage sale.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Body Harvest</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Body Harvest is not a great game – and its visuals definitely didn’t age well. But it’s an experiment so ahead of its time, it deserves to be played again. From the makers of Grand Theft Auto comes a fully polygonal alien invasion action adventure that lets you command any vehicle you see. If you’re intrigued, please see my column for more: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/body-harvest-the-game-nintendo-walked-away-from">Body Harvest: The Game Nintendo Walked Away From</a>. Killer soundtrack, too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/05/13/bodyharvest-toys-1683937341671.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Body Harvest's toy box of commandable vehicles.</figcaption></figure></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Bomberman X4</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo 64 is home to four Bomberman games. Let me break them all down so you know which one's which. The first, Bomberman 64, known as Baku Bomberman in Japan, is notable mostly for bringing Bomberman into polygonal 3D. It’s not as snappy as its 2D predecessors, but it’s still fun to revisit. It was followed by the single-player Bomberman Hero. The lack of multiplayer was confounding and the action is decent enough, but it's at the bottom of the Bomberman list for me. It was followed by Bomberman 64: Second Attack. This underrated sequel to the inaugural 64 outing ffeatures more multiplayer options, including two-player co-op and a four-player splitscreen mode. Not all of them hit, but it’s still a quality game to revisit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, things get confusing. There’s also: <strong>Bomberman 64</strong>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">No, you’re not seeing double. This Racjin-developed game takes everything back to 2D. Which much better results. Only released in Japan, it’s a shame the real Bomberman 64 from the makers of Snowbo Kids is more obscure than the inferior earlier title. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Castlevania: Legacy Of Darkness</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami tried really hard – and struggled – to bring all its classic 2D series into the third dimension. It gave up on Contra 64 outright and canceled the project, while Goemon fared slightly better and saw two N64 releases, covered above. But you have to laud Konami for not giving up. Legacy of Darkness is basically a redo of Castlevania [64]. Its foggy, blurry visuals won’t dazzle you, but it’s a flawed and forgotten gem worth remembering. I still love that oversized “Home Depot Skeleton” battle. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Cruis’n USA and Cruis’n World</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Take a deep breath. I don’t love these games. Actually, I don’t even <strong>like</strong> these games. I had some fun with Cruis’n USA in the arcades, but only when there weren’t better racers around to play – which was rare, because contemporaries like Daytona USA were always near. The N64 version isn’t a great conversion, but I know many older arcade fans are nostalgic for both Cruis’n games, so it feels right to include them with a special callout.. I do appreciate Williams/Midway's early attempts to recreate arcade game on Nintendo 64 -- a key reason why Nintendo of America included them in their much-publicized Dream Team. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Donkey Kong 64</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While I’m making you angry, I have very mixed feelings about DK 64 as well. The two Banjo games are definitely superior in every way, which is no doubt why both were prioritized for release on Switch. But for all the collection bloat, Donkey Kong 64 still has some memorable moments -- and music -- that make it worth revisiting. Plus, that yellow cartridge looks mighty good in either the white or the black Analogue 3D. Overclocking helps with its erratic framerate, but the drop in quality from Banjo-Kazooie is palpable when you play them back to back. I know, I know, many of you love it. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Doubutsu no Mori (Animal Crossing)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Animal Crossing on GameCube was actually a port of Doubutsu no Mori, a Nintendo 64 “communication game” that predates it by a full year. You’ll have to be able to read Japanese kana to fully enjoy it – but also note that you’ll mostly be playing the same game that later came to GameCube as Animal Crossing and Doubutsu no Mori+. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">San Francisco Rush and Rush 2049</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The original arcade conversion was surprisingly competent, but the Nintendo 64 version of its sequel, Rush 2049, manages the rare feat of being better than the arcade original. The key to its success was the ability to control the vehicles while airborne, which made all the difference for this version’s battle and stunt modes. “Rush… It’s DANGEROUS.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Gauntlet Legends</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Atari was intent on reinventing each one of its arcade classics in 3D for the new millennium, and Gauntlet Legends turned out to be one of the few that made it and left an impression. Ironically, its blocky polygonal graphics didn’t age as well as the OG’s top-down sprites, but I remember having a plenty of fun playing four-player in both the arcades and at home on N64. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hybrid Heaven</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not as good as you remember it to be, but it remains a really unique attempt at marrying Metal Gear-style action with classic roleplaying gameplay. Ultimately, the world you explore is just not interesting enough to keep most player’s attention, but it’s historically interesting as the only sci-fi action RPG from Konami’s Osaka team and because it featured a widescreen mode way back in 1999. Hybrid Heaven supported the physical Expansion Pak for higher resolution output on N64 hardware, which the Analogue 3D supports virtually as well. For all its faults, Hybrid Heaven remains a cool experimental game that unfortunately ended up a mere footnote in Konami console game history.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mickey’s Speedway USA</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m no fan of Mickey’s Speedway USA – to me, it’s the game where Rare’s considerable design chops fell victim to having to color in the lines of a high-profile license. But it’s unlikely we’ll ever see this Disney take on Mario Kart (with way too wide tracks) re-released, so snap it up if you encounter it in the wild. The marriage of Nintendo, Rare, and Disney seemed like the start of a beautiful friendship and Speedway USA is more of a dead end -- but it's still cool to see Rare try something very "American", even if its NASCAR with mice and dogs didn't quite work out. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Micro Machines 64 Turbo</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s a surprisingly good racing game, on the other hand. Unfairly overlooked, Micro Machines 64 Turbo is a top-down multiplayer racer that offers up super-fun four player action with 32 different vehicle types – cars, tanks, boats, helicopters – across 48 different tracks. It even features an eight-player mode via what it calls “pad share” (yes, it’s as awkward as it sounds, but you have to appreciate the total commitment to create the ultimate party game). </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mischief Makers</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Mischief Makers bucked the trend of making every game 3D on N64 and it’s still good for some fast and fluid action from storied developer Treasure. It’s not as good as Treasure’s own Gunstar Heroes for Genesis, but hey, not many games let you play as a brawling robot maid. We haven't gotten a new Treasure game since 2014, so even its lesser efforts are worth digging up. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mission: Impossible</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The movie-licensed Mission: Impossible may not be a great game, but it's worth adding to your physical cart collection as something that will likely never see a re-release on any platform due to licensing issues and the fact that it's a better museum piece than a video game. Mission: Impossible was a hugely ambitious game development project that didn’t quite make it to the desired finish line. It was pared down and became considerably less ambitious to get it out the door, but some of the great ideas are still to be found in what could’ve been a Hitman game before there were Hitman games. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Though not as good as the Dreamcast version, Rayman 2: The Great Escape on Nintendo 64 is an excellent platformer that shows the limbless hero could hang with Mario and Banjo (unlike Ubi’s very similar 3D platformer attempt that year, Tonic Trouble). Rayman’s 2D outings have aged better, but The Great Escape is still surprisingly good.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Snowboard Kids 1 and 2</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo 64’s four controller ports and early success with Mario Kart 64 multiplayer inspired some developers to experiment with “Mario Kart, but with…” games. With Snowboard Kids, Osaka-based Racjin found the winning formula. Never as good as Mario Kart – or 1080, for that matter – both Snowbo Kids games do conjure up plenty of happy memories of playing against friends. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I know there are plenty of N64 fans who would put this in their top 10 based on the strength of its excellent Hoth level. Visually, it was way ahead of its time. But unfortunately, most of the game is marred by sluggish and unbalanced first-person shooter sections and a repetitive, highly compressed mono soundtrack. It’s an interesting failure that has its fans. Worth playing just for the Snowspeeder bits and the fuzzy memories. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Top Gear and Friends</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I wrote about the original Top Gear on SNES in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forgotten-gems-top-racer-back-in-top-gear">previous installment of this column</a>, but N64 is a home to a slew of Top Gear titles, all quite different from each other. There’s Top Gear Rally, Top Gear Rally 2, Top Gear Overdrive, and Top Gear Hyperbike. The first one is still arguably the best in the bunch – Boss Game Studios, how you’re missed! Top Gear Rally and the Boss-developed street racing successor World Drive Championship showed what was graphically possible on Nintendo 64, while the Saffire-developed Top Gear Rally 2 added equipment failure to the mix for a more authentic endurance racing experience. Top Gear Overdrive, finally, is an obscure attempt at challenging Beetle Adventure Racing – and it’s quite competent. It’s from Snowblind Studios, the people behind Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance. That same team also made Top Gear Hyperbike – a decent racer, but not in the same league as Excitebike 64. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tetrisphere, The New Tetris, Tetris 64, and Magical Tetris Challenge</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo 64 was home to many quality puzzle games, some of which have already been released on Nintendo Switch. But there’s a quadrilogy of Tetris games that never got there that’s still worth playing. The visually-exciting but also confusing Tetrisphere and the more traditional The New Tetris are mostly notable for their kicking soundtrack (the same composer scored both), while the Japan-only Tetris 64 mixed things up significantly with new block sizes and different modes (and a bio sensor you can clamp to your ear). Capcom’s quality attempt, Magical Tetris Challenge, combines two complicated licenses – Disney and Tetris – and thus will never be seen again outside its limited console run (and the arcade original it’s based on). </p><p id="honorable-mentions"><h2 data-cy="title1" data-toc-title="Honorable Mentions">There's Even More</h2></p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best of Nintendo 64</h3><p>Here are the N64 games that have left the biggest mark not just on our lives, but on the industry as a whole. You can use this list to track which games you've played, make your personal Nintendo Online wishlist, or re-rank them and make your own Top 25.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">How’s that for a list to keep you busy? No, they're not all great -- but they're all interesting games that are surely worth another look. There’s plenty more, of course, from the oddball liquid puzzler Wetrix, to WipEout 64, platformers Chameleon Twist and Glover, rally racer MRC, and some quality sports games like NFL Blitz, ISS ‘98, and NBA Courtside. Bored with GoldenEye? Eurocom’s The World is Not Enough isn’t bad. Plus, there are the excellent (but widely available) Worms Armageddon, Spider-Man, Vigilante 8, and some fun and goofy ports of StarCraft 64, Command &amp; Conquer, Quake, Quake II, Rainbow Six, and Duke Nukem to keep you busy. And yes, I know about Quest 64 and the Army Men games – more power to you if you enjoy them – but they’re not on my Christmas List.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you have any favorite Nintendo 64 games that I didn’t mention?
