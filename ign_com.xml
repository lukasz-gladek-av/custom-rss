            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-will-let-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-ranked-console-players-disable-crossplay-with-pc-as-cheating-complaints-ramp-up<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision has addressed Call of Duty community complaints about cheating in Black Ops 6 and Warzone, and confirmed plans to let console Ranked players disable crossplay with PC players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cheating has become the hottest topic among hardcore Call of Duty fans following the release of Ranked Play in Black Ops 6 and Warzone with the launch of Season 1 last year. The apparent prevalence of cheaters is considered by some to be ruining competitive multiplayer, and Activision had come under fire for failing to address the problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Activision’s Team Ricochet, the division responsible for its Call of Duty anti-cheat tech, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-admits-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-anti-cheat-did-not-hit-the-mark-at-the-launch-of-season-1">admitted not enough had been done to prevent cheating with the launch of Season 1</a>. “After a series of updates our systems are in a better place today across all modes; however, we did not hit the mark for the integration of Ricochet Anti-Cheat at the launch of Season 01 — particularly for Ranked Play,” Activision said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-community-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new blog post</a>, Activision outlined its plan to tackle cheating in Call of Duty in 2025, revealing it had issued over 136,000 Ranked Play account bans since the mode launched. Season 2, which begins soon, includes new and improved client and server-side detections and systems as well as a major kernel-level driver update, Activision said. The company promised “a multitude of new tech” for Season 3 and beyond, including a brand-new system to authenticate legit players and target cheaters. It didn’t want to go into detail on that now, however, so as not to give cheat developers “a peek behind the curtain.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, with the launch of Season 2, Activision will enable the ability to disable crossplay for console players who want to compete only against other console players in Black Ops 6 and Warzone Ranked Play. It is believed that the majority of cheating in video games is on the PC side, and indeed Call of Duty players on console have for years now disabled crossplay as a matter of course for standard Multiplayer. Now, Ranked players will get the chance, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We'll be monitoring closely and will consider further changes to prioritize the integrity of the ecosystem, and we’ll have more details to share as we get closer to the launch of this feature,” Activision said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most Activision anti-cheat updates are met with a healthy dose of scepticism from hardcore fans, and this latest one is no different. Cheating is not unique to Call of Duty of course, but it has become a significant reputation issue for Activision ever since the free-to-download battle royale Warzone exploded in popularity back in 2020. The mega publisher has spent millions of dollars developing its anti-cheat technology as well as pursuing cheat makers in the courts, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name"><u>a number of recent high-profile successes</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October, ahead of the launch of Black Ops 6, Activision said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-it-wants-to-catch-and-remove-call-of-duty-cheaters-within-1-hour-of-them-being-in-their-first-match"><u>it aimed to kick cheaters out of the game within one hour of them being in their first match</u></a>. Black Ops 6 launched with an updated version of Ricochet's kernel-level driver (this also applied to Warzone), with new machine-learning behavioral systems focused on speed of detection and the analysis of gameplay to combat aim bots in place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The people behind cheats are organized, illegal groups that pick apart every piece of data within our games to look for some way to make cheating possible," Activision said at the time. "These bad guys are not just some script kiddies poking around with code they found online. They are a collective who profit from exploiting the hard work of game developers across the industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But cheat developers are flawed (clearly — they have to pretend to be good at video games). Every time they cheat, they leave breadcrumbs behind. We’re always looking for those breadcrumbs to find the bad actors and get them out of the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gives-away-its-most-mysterious-card-to-all-players-today<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Trading Card Pocket has finally revealed its most mysterious card by giving it away to all players for free today, January 20.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An alternate art version of the Pokédex is now available as a reward for the worldwide player base of Pokémon TCG Pocket collecting a total of 40 billion cards. This Pokédex is Promo A card 008, which was blank until today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To celebrate achieving 40 billion cards acquired in total by players around the world, we are giving you a promo card," developer Creatures Inc. said. The Pokédex card is available until April 30, 2025, after which point it will seemingly become unobtainable for good.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/20/img-5531-1737376012565.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have long wondered how the Pokédex card would be made available, as the other Promo A cards from 001 to 009 were all available upon Pokémon TCG Pocket's launch. Creatures Inc. has since released every other Promo A card up to number 033, leaving the 008 slot strangely blank until now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This release also confirms the Pokédex is not connected to the Advance Ticket item hiding in players' inventories. "This ticket cannot be used yet," reads the description of the item, also available since launch. "Wait and see what it's for!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though one Pokémon TCG Pocket mystery has today been solved, fans will just have to be patient before this other one is detailed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived in October and follows the standard mobile and free-to-play game model, flooding players with rewards in the first few days before soon drying up, with spending real-world money the only real way to re-experience that early thrill <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-reveals-mew-led-set-coming-next-week-and-60-million-download-milestone">outside of the occasional set drop like Mythical Island</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing Genetic Apex, the first set of cards which totals 226 officially but also contains 60 rare alternate art cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take players not spending money around two years according to one estimate</a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-player-reveals-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-complete-the-first-set-after-spending-1500">those looking to make it rain can wrap up the collection after dropping around $1,500</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans' complaints over this high cost were exacerbated when Creatures Inc. outlined its highly anticipated trading feature too, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-trading-unveiled-but-is-so-poorly-received-the-developers-had-to-respond">which caused such an uproar that it had to release a follow-up response</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-insists-the-game-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-as-fans-obsess-over-a-picture-of-chocolate-cake<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight fans have been through the wringer recently, with cryptic X/Twitter activity from one developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake">sparking rampant speculation that the hotly anticipated follow-up Hollow Knight: Silksong will finally re-emerge at Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct in April</a> — and potentially even release on Nintendo’s next-gen console as a timed launch exclusive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all started when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i31gas/what_we_know_so_far_about_the_william_pellen/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>supersleuths on the Hollow Knight subreddit</u></a> noticed that on January 15, co-director of Team Cherry William Pellen had changed his Twitter/X profile picture to a picture of a chocolate cake. Alongside this, Pellen tweeted: “something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Nintendo’s Switch 2 reveal was rumored for January 16, and so it proved — that was the day <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name"><u>Nintendo finally announced the Switch 2</u></a>. Had Pellen really asked followers to keep an eye out for the Switch 2 reveal? If so, why?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans then reverse-searched the picture of the cake, leading them to a recipe for Brooklyn Blackout Cake on cooking website <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/blackout-cake" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bon Appétit</u></a>. The date the recipe was published: April 2, 2024. The date of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct is April 2, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans also wondered what Pellen’s new X/Twitter handle, @everydruidwaswr, meant, if anything. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i36zi6/comment/m7l3uqu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Redditor Representative-True speculated</u></a> that the “wr” in “everydruidwaswr” was the start of a word, perhaps “wrong,” or perhaps stands for “was wrong,” and pointed to the Druid of the Moss Temple Silksong NPC as evidence of… something.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pellen had a new X/Twitter name to go along with the new handle and profile picture: “little bomey.” Fans noticed Little Boomey is a wine from Southern Australia, where Team Cherry is based, but the spelling is different. The upshot of all this was that some fans thought Pellen had kicked off a Silksong alternate reality game (ARG), but over the weekend comments appeared to pour cold water on this theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, Hollow Knight YouTuber fireb0rn <a href="https://x.com/fireb0rn/status/1880411907552911626" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to say Team Cherry marketing and publishing chief Matthew 'Leth' Griffin had got in touch “to confirm there was no Silksong ARG and that the changes to William's account and the tweet were a nothingburger. Apologies to have misled everyone. The cake was a lie."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/283467363729408000/586931790208434203/1330100156518891571" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on the Hollow Knight Discord</a>, Griffin backed this up, saying: "It wasn’t [an ARG]. But it was still some impressive sleuthing skills by the fans... like ya’ll are WAY beyond those 2020 riddles now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Griffin himself followed up to respond to one fan who wondered if Team Cherry had given up on Hollow Knight: Silksong. “Yes the game is real, progressing and will release,” <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Griffin tweeted</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This has done little to calm all the speculation, as you can perhaps imagine. And at the time of this article’s publication, Pellen’s tweet remains online. Pellen himself has yet to explain whatever his X/Twitter activity is all about, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembering that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-sequel-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch"><u>when Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced</u></a>, Team Cherry confirmed the launch platforms as Windows, Mac, Linux, and Nintendo Switch. But that was six years ago. We have a few months to find out what this all means, but in the meantime, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-heres-everything-announced-and-confirmed"><u>everything announced at Nintendo's Switch 2 reveal</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
