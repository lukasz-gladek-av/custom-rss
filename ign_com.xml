            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon's promised ad spot at the Super Bowl just aired, and in it we got a glimpse into the Pokémon preferences of celebrities such as Lady Gaga, Trevor Noah, Charles Leclerc, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The minute-long ad shows Lady Gaga, Trevor Noah, Formula One racer Charles Leclerc, singer Jisoo, actor Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Spanish football (soccer, for the Americans) player Lamine Yamal and rapper Young Miko all describing their favorite Pokémon before eventually revealing them. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Lady Gaga (of course) picked Jigglypuff, and Jigglypuff even did a brief little duet with her singing its signature song. Trevor Noah prefers Psyduck, Leclerc chooses Arcanine, Jisoo picks Eevee, Ramakrishnan chooses Luxray, Yamal picks Zygarde, and Young Miko's partner is Gengar. Shockingly, The Pokémon Company managed not to put Pikachu in this ad anywhere (except in the logo, of course)!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ad ends with all the celebrities asking the audience, "What's your favorite?" This question is the start of a year-long campaign put on by The Pokémon Company in celebration of its 30th anniversary. In addition to the ad, The Pokémon Company is kicking things off by introducing a new camera feature to Pokémon GO (which is somehow ten years old this year!) that allows users to participate in the campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, The Pokémon Company has promised various events including "Day Out" and "Night Out" experiences designed for fans to celebrate Pokémon, with daytime events more family-focused and nighttime events more for adults who grew up with the series. The Pokémon Company has also already announced other celebratory events, such as a <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-tcg/product-gallery/pokemon-day-2026-collection" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">themed TCG collection</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-fans-dissect-new-pokmon-sets-praise-eevee-but-say-mega-bloks-did-pikachu-better">Pokemon LEGO sets</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon's 30th is a big moment for the franchise, and we're expecting them to celebrate in style. Historically Pokémon has thrown a big digital showcase entitled Pokémon Presents on or around Pokémon Day (February 27), where the company lays out its plans for the year across video games, the TCG, and merchandise. Fans are eagerly hoping for the announcement of a new Pokémon game, perhaps a remake of beloved DS games Black and White, or the kick-off for the next generation of Pokémon, Gen 10. Heck, at this point, I'd just be happy to have the classic games on Nintendo Switch Online!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?
