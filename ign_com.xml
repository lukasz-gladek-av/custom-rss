According to data compiled by the website, State of Play now ranks as the third most-popular gaming or tech showcase of 2025 by peak concurrent viewership. Only two Nintendo Direct presentations pulled in bigger numbers (understandably, Nintendo's Switch 2 reveal is top by a long way).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/ps5s-brilliant-new-state-of-play-breaks-records-for-sony" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Push Square</u></a>, the State of Play wasn't Sony's most-watched livestream ever — that honor goes to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-reveal-everything-announced-all-games"><u>PS5 reveal event</u></a>, which currently boasts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkC0l4iekYo&amp;pp=0gcJCbIJAYcqIYzv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>44 million views</u></a>.

But Tuesday's livestream remains hands-down the most popular State of Play showing ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The State of Play focused on third-party — and particularly Japanese developers — with strong announcements from the likes of Capcom, Grasshopper Manufacture, Konami, ArtPlay, Square Enix, and Team Ninja. There were surprisingly few first-party titles in the presentation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also felt very much like this year's summer presentation was focused on committed gamers, too. There seemed to be a propensity of action games, many of which will likely come with mature/18+ ratings. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Need to catch up?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2s-best-selling-eshop-launch-games-revealed-and-those-10-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-upgrades-are-right-up-there<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">24 hours into the life of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, it's time to look at what's selling best on the new console's eShop — and get a sense of just how popular those rather minimal-looking Zelda upgrades have been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Top of the Switch 2 eShop charts at the time of writing is, of course, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> — the console's flagship launch title that many (most?) owners will have picked up alongside the console. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no surprise to see this in the top spot, and anyone who bought the Switch 2 bundle with Mario Kart World included will have contributed to its placing here, as you'll have had to redeem an eShop code and download its digital version.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, perhaps surprisingly, is Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition. Developer CD Projekt will no doubt be delighted to see its latest game doing so well on Switch 2, after it previously skipped Nintendo's last-gen console. With the power to run Cyberpunk's Night City now available, Switch 2 owners look to have jumped at the chance to catch up with the open-world RPG. Earlier this week, IGN chatted with CD Projekt to find out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-red-got-cyberpunk-2077-running-on-switch-2">how the developer managed to get Cyberpunk 2077 working on Switch 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Third is Nintendo's own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>. This is the $10 collection of mini-games and tech demos that many fans believe should have been offered for free (and after an hour with the game myself last night, I am inclined to agree). Part instruction manual, part interactive museum exhibit, Welcome Tour is at least fairly cheap. (Just remember <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-which-everyone-thinks-should-be-free-requires-95-of-accessories-and-a-4k-tv-for-100-completion">you'll need a camera and a separate controller/grip with GL/GR buttons to play everything included in it</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fourth best-selling game on the Switch 2 eShop right now is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a>, a game which you may not have heard of. This fast-paced sci-fi racer is an interesting addition to the console's launch line-up, as developer Shin'en Multimdia previously released the similar Fast RMX as a launch title for the original Switch, back in March 2017. Why is this series popular with Nintendo fans? Well, because it is essentially F-Zero. And without a new F-Zero from Nintendo anytime soon (if ever again), hardcore Nintendo fans love it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fast Fusion Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The fifth biggest game on the Switch 2 eShop is not actually a game, but an upgrade — yes, it's the $10 upgrade to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. It's interesting to see this chart so highly, as Nintendo Switch Online subscribers do get this add-on included as part of their membership. But perhaps fans have decided they want it to keep? Or maybe they haven't realised. Regardless, the fact this upgrade is so popular clearly shows Nintendo was right to assume people would pay up for some improved visuals (something you get free in upgrades to other titles, such as Pokémon Scarlet and Violet), plus access to a new mobile app.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sixth on the Switch 2 eShop right now is Deltarune, which just launched its latest chapters this week. Seventh is the $10 upgrade pack for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> (as an older game, perhaps fewer people are still playing it compared to Tears of the Kingdom). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In eighth place is relaxing role-player Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, while ninth place goes to Square Enix's Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster. This is followed by Yakuza 0 and Street Fighter 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Edition. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After these, the full Switch 2 Editions of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild sandwich Hitman World of Assassination. And lastly in the chart is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, whose Switch 2 version features a number of graphical upgrades. A $10 upgrade for this Harry Potter prequel RPG is also available if you owned the game on the original Switch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Finally, here is the Switch 2 eShop launch day chart as a handy list:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Mario Kart World</li><li>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</li><li>Fast Fusion</li><li>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Upgrade Pack</li><li>Deltarune</li><li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Upgrade Pack</li><li>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</li><li>Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</li><li>Yakuza 0</li><li>Street Fighter 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</li><li>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Switch 2 Edition</li><li>Hitman: World of Assassination</li><li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Switch 2 Edition</li><li>Hogwarts Legacy</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
