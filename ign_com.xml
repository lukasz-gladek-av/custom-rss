            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> chief Randy Pitchford has said that if other developers better understood why gamers love making decisions about loot, Gearbox would have “good competitors.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford was speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0m7sd7y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC Radio 5 Live</a> to discuss the release of Borderlands 4 and Gearbox’s journey alongside the series’ success. The outspoken developer said that even though the Borderlands franchise will break through 100 million units sold with Borderlands 4 (publisher 2K Games has yet to announce a sales figure), he insisted “we suck!” because that 100 million is but a drop in the ocean that is the total number of potential gamers globally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our mission is to entertain the world,” Pitchford said. “Which means we suck! Because there are billions of people in the world. We got a lot of work to do. Borderlands, with 4, we’re gonna cross probably 100 million units sold, with Borderlands 4, of the franchise. That’s awesome compared to a lot of things. But it kinda sucks if your goal is to entertain the world. So I feel like we’re just getting started.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’ve been working on Borderlands for over 20 years now. And it feels like we’re starting to get pretty good at it. It feels like we’re starting to figure it out. I feel like we’ve probed a lot of the end points. But I don’t think we’re anywhere near the end of a journey.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/13/gettyimages-2165642737-1760354699644.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Randy Pitchford has thoughts about the looter shooter genre. Photo by Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images for Lionsgate.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford then entered into a rather philosophical debate about why people love looter shooters like Borderlands so much. This is a game that revolves around the hunt for better loot — in the case of Borderlands 4 billions of potential weapons are available — and players fuss over whether to equip something new that’s just dropped or stick with what they already have, even if it’s inferior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a constant loop in the Borderlands games, which are packed with enemies, crates, chests, and even toilets that spit out loot. Perhaps to a greater extent than any other looter shooter, loot is everywhere in Borderlands, and the player is constantly having to pause to wonder, is that item that just dropped worth my time?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the time, the answer is no. But sometimes the answer is yes. Either way, as you play Borderlands and fuss over the minutiae of your build, you're always asking yourself whether this item or that item will help make the numbers go up within your playstyle. Farming for these items is all part of the loot hunt and, for so many millions of fans, the whole reason to play Borderlands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(Coincidentally, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-want-to-know-what-sort-of-odds-i-am-trying-to-beat-when-i-am-grinding-a-game-150-hours-and-over-3000-boss-kills-later-a-superfan-has-worked-out-borderlands-4s-disappointingly-low-drop-rate">IGN recently interviewed a Borderlands 4 player who spent 150 hours on over 3,000 boss kills to find out the game’s true drop rate</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands games are tuned to present these sorts of loot conundrums “by design,” Pitchford explained, before saying he expected the franchise to have more imitators by now because of how addictive this loop is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You’re poking at some fundamentals, which is part of why I think Borderlands as a game has worked, and does work, and why it’s a very delicate design that I think is one of the reasons why there haven’t really been many successful imitators since we first showed how a shooter looter could work with the original game,” Pitchford said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands doesn’t have the looter shooter genre to itself, of course. Perhaps its most high-profile rival is Bungie’s Destiny, although that Sony-owned franchise has seen better days. Other examples include People Can Fly’s Outriders (no sequel in sight), and Ubisoft’s The Division (The Division 3 is in the works). If we’re stretching the definition of looter shooter, we might include games like Warframe, Remnant 2, or The First Descendant. Rocksteady’s disastrous Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is perhaps the most high-profile of looter shooter failures. Certainly, Borderlands and its various entries dominate the space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it all comes down to nailing the “gratifying” decision around loot in Borderlands. It is something, Pitchford said, humans love to do because it scratches an itch in our brains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That decision, that choice about, do I keep what I have or do I try the new thing? That is a very compelling, fundamental, both need and skill that our brains have, to make choices like that,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve reduced it down to this simple moment with this interface in this system. It’s a gratifying loop. It’s a gratifying decision. Our brains need to do it, and our brains like doing it. And we’re better off when we do it. The more we exercise that muscle, not just in the video game but literally in life — this is what separates our species from a lot of others, and how we developed language and how we developed all kinds of high levels of consciousness and cognition that allow us to analyse the world. Most of what our prefrontal cortex is for — why that adaptation exists and what it’s used for — is that skill, or versions of it. We’ve reduced it down into this design. And yes — the is the thing I’m looking at better than the thing I’ve got, and managing the cognition between the objective, almost scientific analysis of that choice, versus the emotional impact on that choice, and having those at odds with each other frequently, is very interesting, and dare I say it addictive.”</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford continued: “We don’t do it because it’s addictive. We do it because it’s stimulating and because we kind of need that. Part of why games exist are to… yeah. we can live a fantasy that we might not be able to have in the real world, and we can explore themes and ideas in a safe place that we can’t explore in the real world, but we also can, because it’s an interactive simulation, we can test our thinking and our decision making and put our brain to work in really interesting ways that we kind of need and want.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, the puzzlement that other developers haven’t taken Borderlands on at its own game, and the associated suggestion that Gearbox’s rivals aren’t thinking about the looter shooter on the same level as the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If other game designers that were trying to get in on the action, so to speak, understood that, we’d have more competitors, or we’d have good competitors,” he said. “But we haven’t so far. It’s weird. The kinds of people that just want to go after it, they’re not thinking about it on that level. They’re just putting into motion something because of market analysis. It’s not a designer’s or creator’s drive that’s doing it. It’s either a business drive or a wishing to be something that you’re not kind of drive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s so weird. I fully expected after the first game came out that everyone would be hip to exactly what you mentioned, and we’d immediately see lots of other games imitating and aping, and we’d be dead, because we can’t compete with a lot of other folks, especially back then. We were the scrappy underdogs.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Certainly, the critical reception to Borderlands 4 suggests Gearbox has once again successfully presented a looter shooter that ticks all the right boxes. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-review">Borderlands 4 review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Borderlands 4 gives the series the massive kick in the pants it has needed, with a fantastic open world and greatly improved combat, even if bugs and invisible walls can sometimes throw off that groove.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Borderlands 4. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dataminer-unearths-evidence-to-suggest-a-much-maligned-borderlands-3-character-was-cut-and-replaced-late-in-development"><u>a Borderlands 4 dataminer unearthed evidence to suggest that one of the most hated characters from Borderlands 3 was cut and replaced relatively late in development</u></a>. 2K Games and Gearbox declined to comment when contacted by IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.

I’d also say we don’t see a great number of five-color preconstructed decks, but we’re literally getting one in Lorwyn Eclipsed, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All four turtles, plus Splinter?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> gives its revenge-seeking protagonist Atsu a wide range of traditional Japanese weapons to wield, including bows, swords and spears. Last week, however, a Japanese-speaking user on X questioned whether it was realistic or even possible for Atsu to draw a very long sword from her back, prompting a flood of video comments from traditional Japanese martial arts practitioners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Ghost of Yotei, you’ll pick up the Odachi (literally ‘big sword’) in The Way of the Odachi quest (check out our walkthrough <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/ghost-of-yotei/The_Way_of_the_Odachi_Walkthrough"><u>here</u></a>). It is a useful addition to Atsu’s arsenal, especially when facing off against larger enemies (brutes). It allows her to block heavy attacks and then push back against the opponent, opening them up for a devastating slice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As she already has two swords at her hip, Atsu opts to sheath the Odachi on her back, however X user ikazombie questioned how on earth you’d pull this off without dislocating something. Upon slowing the clip down, they realised that you could theoretically draw and sheath it from over your left shoulder, but seemed unconvinced about how this would be accomplished in real life.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">大太刀、あんなデカい刀を背負ってどうやって抜刀すんねん関節外れるぞと思ってたんだけど、予想外のモーションで ” 理 論 上 は ” 問題なく抜刀/納刀できてたの笑う<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GhostofYotei?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GhostofYotei</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%AA%E3%83%96%E3%83%A8%E3%82%A6%E3%83%86%E3%82%A4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ゴーストオブヨウテイ</a> <a href="https://t.co/j31VjGpgDk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/j31VjGpgDk</a></p>— ジェット・リョー (@ikazombie) <a href="https://twitter.com/ikazombie/status/1974771283360645536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Japanese martial arts practitioners commented with videos. User Harima_mekkai (a member of the Tenshinryu school) decided to try out Atsu’s way of wearing and drawing an Odachi. She posted a video of herself successfully unsheathing a 1m long sword weighing 1.5kg from over her left shoulder. This shows that the drawing part of Atsu's Odachi technique is actually doable, albeit it takes effort and training to pull it off that smoothly.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— まーこ　11月29日生誕祭🎂 (@harima_mekkai) <a href="https://twitter.com/harima_mekkai/status/1975527448180891946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Another user by the name of Lornplum replied with a video of himself drawing and sheathing a back-mounted sword and described the way Atsu deals with the length by holding the blade as she draws it as a "brilliant touch of realism." </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">刀身持って長さを稼ぐやり方としては絶妙なリアリティ<br>現実でやるならこういうかんじ<a href="https://t.co/X3PqwBcMOq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/X3PqwBcMOq</a></p>— lornplum (@lornplum) <a href="https://twitter.com/lornplum/status/1974791334272921826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Sucker Punch did get members of the Tenshinryu school to do motion capture for the sword fights and stances in Ghost of Yotei. Tenshinryu is a traditional Japanese martial art which dates from the 1600s and covers the art of a wide variety of weapons, including spears, swords and chain sickles. PlayStation Japan recently posted a side-by-side video of Ghost of Yotei footage and Tenshinryu members enacting the fight scene.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— プレイステーション公式 (@PlayStation_jp) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation_jp/status/1976269162147422445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">However, there is still a bit of video game coolness trumping realism here. The clips of real-life pros show them moving the sheath up and over their shoulder more (or even <a href="https://x.com/lornplum/status/1974797905312813146" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>around their body</u></a>) to make it easier to draw and sheath the weapon. This is especially apparent when sheathing the sword. It seems that the amount of movement in Atsu’s Odaichi sheathing was reduced, likely to make whipping out and holstering the weapon smoother and more responsive for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Lornplum <a href="https://x.com/lornplum/status/1975554349884690691" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented </u></a>on Harima_Mekkai’s demonstration of drawing a Odaichi Atsu-style: “As you can see, with some effort anyone can manage to draw it, however sheathing it (like Atsu does) is pretty much impossible.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While they look cool in games, it goes without saying that having a sword on your back in real life makes it much more awkward to access than if it was at your hip. Last year, a Link cosplayer found it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/masahiro-sakurai-helps-zelda-cosplayer-struggling-to-unsheathe-links-sword-by-explaining-how-it-works-in-smash-bros"><u>impossible to unsheath their back-mounted sword</u></a> Breath of the Wild-style. However, they received a bit of unexpected advice from none other than Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai, who explained that they made Link’s sword skills a little more realistic for Smash Bros.

As a result, if you're playing on PS5 and short of space, it may be worth uninstalling the game then downloading it again, rather than downloading the update on top of the game itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the PS5 version, patch 1.0.20.21756 improves the game's loading speed, the clarity of certain textures, CPU and rendering performance in numerous scenarios, memory usage, and the quality of motion blur to mitigate the aliasing issues that occur when the camera pans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On PC, the patch adds integrated AMD FSR4 support, improves Compatible Mode, and "significantly" improves the lighting quality when Global Illumination is set to low, making it closer to the effect when Global Illumination is set to high.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a quick overview on <a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1977192496716517644" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>social media</u></a> — and a more detailed outline on developer Game Science's <a href="https://gamesci.cn/wukong/news/detail?id=235" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official website</u></a> — the studio advised that, as well as the usual bug fixes, the "considerable number of underlying changes" coming in to boost performance not only impacts PS5 hard drives, but also PC mods, which "may cause compatibility issues" and "prevent you from launching the game or triggering error pop-ups during gameplay." Consequently, the team recommends players uninstall all mods and verify the integrity of files before restarting the game after you apply the latest patch. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The update rolls out across all platforms from today (October 13).

(PC)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>If you have installed any mods in the game, installing the patch may cause compatibility issues. This could prevent you from launching the game, loading your saved games, or triggering error pop-ups during gameplay. We recommend uninstalling the installed mods and verifying the integrity of the game files before restarting the game. (PC)</li><li>The performance optimization this time involves a considerable number of underlying changes, which results in a relatively larger patch size. If the update fails due to insufficient storage or other reasons, please try redownloading the game. (PS5)</li><li>If you encounter unusually large update sizes during patch installation, or if the game gets stuck, crashes, or fails to start after installation, please refer to the Installation/Patch FAQ on our official website.</li><li>This update may require shader recompilation. If you experience crashes during shader compilation, please try restarting the game until the compilation is complete or skip shader compilation. </li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Experience Improvements</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Bosses</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Improved the combat experience against Yaoguai King "Giant Shigandang".</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Interaction</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Journeyer's Chart interface will guide the Destined One to Travel with Keeper's Shrine before any Journeyer's Chart has been obtained.</li><li>Improved the readability of the "Cleared" label in the "Load Journey" interface.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Performance</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Integrated AMD FSR4. On compatible hardware, it will be available in the in-game Settings after updating the driver and enabling FSR4 in the driver settings. (PC)</li><li>Improved Compatible Mode. Now, with Compatible Mode enabled, ray tracing, frame generation, and some super-resolution functions will be temporarily disabled to help players avoid game launch failures caused by driver, hardware, or system abnormalities. (PC)</li><li>Adjusted the default graphics settings for certain graphics cards to match the various graphical changes in the current game version. (PC)</li><li>Significantly improved the lighting quality when Global Illumination is set to low, making it closer to the effect when Global Illumination is set to high. (PC)</li><li>Adjusted Performance Mode back to 60Hz, reducing input latency and achieving higher resolution than before. However, the lighting quality level has been adjusted to enhance performance.

The first such game was released in 2008, and it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dissidia-final-fantasy-review"><u>returned a Great 8.9/10</u></a>. From what we can tell from the new <a href="https://www.square-enix.com/ddff/en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teaser site</u></a> set up by publisher Square Enix, though, this is a "Team Boss Battle Arena" that will only be coming to iOS and Android mobile devices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Square Enix plans to tell us more on October 14, fans have already been scouring the mini-site, which one suggesting the silhouetted roster teaser image <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/1o4eray/teaser_of_the_new_dissidias_roster/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could include key Final Fantasy characters</a> like Edward or Kain, Terra, Warrior of Light, Lightning, Tinoa, Cloud, and more, all "redesigned characters with modern outfits."  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also can see five images of the game's gorgeous environment art on the website, which we've embedded below for you:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dissidia Final Fantasy Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction is mixed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"This bodes totally well."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Go's big week where it finally raises the game's level cap is off to a bad start. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This morning, the game's first ever Weekly Challenge went live — a new feature tasking fans with forming a group of four players to, this week, catch 500 creatures in return for rewards. But the new gameplay feature has been pulled after just a couple of hours, as eager fans who completed the goal quickly reported finding their games suddenly "bricked," and unresponsive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with the feature disabled, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> players impacted by the bug say they remain unable to play — suggesting a more meaningful fix now needs to be rolled out. And all of this comes less than 48 hours before Pokémon Go's huge level 80 update is switched on — something fans are now concerned may end up delayed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/NianticHelp/status/1977645454012620877" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> posted to the game's Niantic Support account on X just minutes ago, the developer admitted it had disabled the new Weekly Challenge feature, as it had become "aware of an issue where some users are unable to close the Weekly Challenge completion popup, preventing them from continuing gameplay."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have temporarily disabled the Weekly Challenge feature as we investigate the issue," the message continued. "We’ll share an update soon."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on top Pokémon fan reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1o5d4ql/weekly_challenge_has_ended_for_everyone/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheSilphRoad</a>, fans who completed their Weekly Challenge say they are "completely locked out" from playing, as loading the game still re-opens the Weekly Challenge screen, which then blocks everything else. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I tried opening the game on an old Android tablet and was able to dismiss the page with the Android back button," wrote fan Gerkenator. "However it returns every time open the game." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others say they've tried deleting and reinstalling the game to no avail. "They really said Pokémon Go Do Something Else," noted Klecktacular.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Pokémon Go's developer investigates the issue, fans fear the impact this latest problem will have on the game's seismic levelling update that's currently scheduled to hit on Wednesday, October 15. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously announced, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-go-boosting-level-cap-and-rebalancing-experience-in-first-major-xp-change-for-5-years">this update will rebalance XP across the entire game and increase its level cap for the first time in five years, from level 50 to level 80</a>. New levelling challenges and rewards will be added, while others will be retired. Players' existing levels will also shift to accomodate a new, smoother levelling curve — with many expected to automatically increase. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, with less than 48 hours to go and an emergency fix for the game's Weekly Challenge feature now seemingly required, it remains to be seen if the big XP update also arrives as planned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This bodes totally well for the level update coming this week," wrote aznknight613. "Meanwhile, the level 80 updates arrives in NZ in like... 27 hours..." noted Brock_Hard_Canuck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll keep an eye on how things are going, and update when we have more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
