            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/rumored-may-2025-free-ps-plus-game-ties-in-with-a-hollywood-movie-release<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It looks like one of the PlayStation Plus games for May 2025 has leaked. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While nothing is confirmed by Sony yet, rumor has it teen slasher horror romp <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/until-dawn">Until Dawn</a> will be a free download for PlayStation players in May. Although the key art certainly suggests it's the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/until-dawn-remastered">Until Dawn Remastered</a> that's coming, rather than the 2014 original, it's not entirely clear; we'll confirm just as soon as we know for sure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-plus"><u>PlayStation Plus</u></a> is an online gaming service for PlayStation platforms that includes free monthly games, limited-time trials, online multiplayer, and member-exclusive discounts. It also includes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/playstation-plus-premium-tier-games"><u>a catalog of hundreds of current and classic games</u></a> for Extra and Premium members, although the monthly free games are available to all players, regardless of their subscription tier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As speculated by some members of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1k7lixr/monthly_game_leaked/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation subreddit</u></a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/04/ps-plus-essential-game-for-may-2025-possibly-leaked-early" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PushSquare</u></a>), this could be a means of promoting the new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/until-dawn"><u>Until Dawn movie</u></a>, which released just ahead of the weekend. It didn't particularly impress us; we awarded it 5/10, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-movie-review-david-f-sandberg"><u>writing in IGN's Until Dawn movie review</u></a>: "Until Dawn is more disappointing than deadly, leaving all the promise of the horror game behind for a jumble of horror-movie re-creations." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's the same score we awarded the 2024 remaster, calling the game an "overpriced and under-featured remake that seems less like a must-have bit of moonlit murder and something closer to daylight robbery" in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/until-dawn-remastered"><u>IGN's Until Dawn Remastered review</u></a>. Supermassive's 2015 original fared much better, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-review"><u>getting a 7.5/10</u></a> from us. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-pulls-first-party-ps3-games-resistance-fall-of-man-and-resistance-2-from-ps5-and-ps4-as-part-of-big-ps-plus-clearout"><u>22 games are set to be pulled from the PlayStation Plus library next month</u></a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v"><u>Grand Theft Auto 5</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/payday-2"><u>Payday 2</u></a>: Crimewave Edition, and the last playable versions of first-party titles <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resistance-fall-of-man"><u>Resistance: Fall of Man</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resistance-2"><u>Resistance 2</u></a>. As a result, Resistance: Fall of Man and Resistance 2 will now completely disappear for modern consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.
