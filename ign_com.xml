No, I don't mean the Super Bowl - it's time for Awesome Games Done Quick, the annual charity speedrunning marathon that features a week of talented gamers showing off the wildest things they can do with video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Done Quick (GDQ) has been running for 15 years now, since 2010. The event is a live broadcast speedrunning marathon, during which speedrunners take turns showing off beating video games as fast as possible, and often in wacky and especially impressive ways. In recent years, the events have shown off increasingly ambitious performances, including blindfolded or one-handed runs, two players using a single controller, showcases of tricky arcade games, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-start-2024-by-interviewing-the-worlds-first-dog-speedrunner">even speedruns performed by dogs</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The annual event is held to raise money for the Prevent Cancer foundation, having previously raised a record high of $3,442,033 in 2022, and $2,539,832 just last year. And this year's marathon has some pretty ridiculous runs on the docket. There's a run of Crazy Taxi backed by a live band, someone playing Elden Ring with a saxophone, new Super Mario Bros. Wii run while simultaneously playing piano, a two-players-one-controller run of Breath of the Wild, loads of randomizer races, and it all wraps up with a Map Randomizer Race between some of the best Super Metroid runners out there. If you've never watched GDQ before, it's really worth tuning in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">AGDQ 2025 kicks off at 9:00 AM PT on Sunday, January 5 with a run of Pikmin on Nintendo Switch, followed by Portal 2. In fact, Sunday's full of bangers: Kirby's Air Ride follows, there's an Astro Bot run, then The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, a run infamous for appearing at GDQ every years and getting shorter each time as the community discovers new, run-changing skips.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/03/fsh-08395-1735942959021.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Awesome Games Done Quick 2024, photo by Wes "Fish" Chan</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If I keep going I'll just list every single run in the entire event, so here's a quick list of highlights you should definitely check out. Definitely peak at the <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/marathons/cm06694cj010zw401cwatx1zo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official website</a> for a look at the full schedule, because there's tons of great runs I didn't list here, and the timing will be subject to change constantly throughout the week.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sunday</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>9:00 AM PT: Pikmin - All Parts</li><li>10:24 AM: Portal 2 - Single player No SLA</li><li>1:56 PM: Ori and the Blind Forest - Randomizer World Tour 11</li><li>3:30 PM: Astro Bot - Any%</li><li>6:19 PM: The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker - Any%</li><li>9:14 PM: Alan Wake 2: Night Springs - All Episodes</li><li>10:01 PM: Alan Wake 2: The lake House - Any%</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Monday</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>9:54 AM PT: UFO 50 - Various Games Showcase</li><li>10:51 AM: Super Meat Boy - Any%</li><li>11:37 AM: Super Mario Maker for Nintendo 3DS - SMC Any% No Auto</li><li>3:00 PM: Metroid Prime - Any% Inbounds Race</li><li>4:42 PM: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Any% 2 Players 1 Controller</li><li>6:45 PM: Horizon: Forbidden Rest - NG+ Story</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Tuesday</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>7:47 AM PT: Unicorn Overlord - Any% Story</li><li>8:26 AM: Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana - All Story Bosses</li><li>10:18 AM: Spyro: Reignited Trilogy - Spyro 1, Any% NBS</li><li>1:25 PM: Super Mario Bros. - Any% STA</li><li>6:20 PM: The Last of Us: Left Behind - Remake - Grounded</li><li>8:05 PM: Silent Hill 2 (2024) - New Game Light Restricted</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Wednesday</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>8:51 AM PT: Sonic X Shadow Generations - Any%</li><li>10:23 AM: Pokemon Let's Go, Pikachu!/Eevee! - Any% Pikachu/Eevee</li><li>1:43 PM: New Super Mario Bros.

These are games that are silly, janky, broken, or otherwise of questionable quality, and always make for some hilarious speedruns. The first run, Superman 64, you've probably heard of before, but the rest you may have not. The Awful Block runs throughout the night on Wednesday into very early Thursday morning. Speaking from experience, I highly recommend having insomnia and staying up all night to watch it. The block concludes with Kevin Costner's Waterworld at 3:11 AM on Thursday.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Thursday</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>10:55 AM PT: The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - All Dungeons</li><li>3:00 PM: Lies of P - Any% Glitchless</li><li>5:02 PM: Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare - Any%</li><li>6:55 PM: CHUNITHM LUMINOUS PLUS - Arcade Showcase</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Friday</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>2:36 AM PT: Final Fantasy VII Rebirth - Any% Easy</li><li>9:21 AM: Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - Tightened Vice</li><li>3:00 PM: Tetris: The Grand Master - Multi Game Showcase</li><li>4:00 PM: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - 48 Tracks (DLC) 200cc, No Items</li><li>5:45 PM: Kaizo Mario World 3 - 100%</li><li>6:52 PM: jubeat copious APPEND - Showcase</li><li>8:07 PM: Super Mario World - 96 Exit Race</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Saturday</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Seriously, just stop sleeping and watch the entire day Saturday.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-dead-tcg-artifact-suddenly-had-12000-players-on-new-years-day-and-the-community-is-baffled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As we rang in the new year earlier this week, thousands of people <em>seemed</em> to be celebrating in an admittedly unusual way: by playing Valve's 2018 TCG Artifact.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, as quickly as they started, the 12,000-ish individuals all stopped playing at once on January 3, leaving the game as empty as it had been at the end of 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who were these people? No one seems to know. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hqvdjy/12k_players_again/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artifact community isn't reporting any sudden spikes in interest</a>, and no one's really talking about the game on social media apart from marveling at the sudden jump in player numbers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So why, then, is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/583950/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a> suggesting that a free-to-play card game that is, by all accounts, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/artifact-valve-stops-development-on-struggling-card-game">close to dead</a>, seeing wild spikes in users over very specific two-day periods?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2025/01/01/12000-people-are-playing-artifact-right-now-and-no-one-knows-why/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by Forbes</a>, Artifact Classic's (the original, now free-to-play version of Artifact) player count suddenly spiked on December 31, jumping from a measly ~200 concurrent players up to the 5,000s, before spiking to a height of over 12,000. Artifact remained at around 11,000 concurrents through the second, before its playercount absolutely tanked back down to ~150 at midnight on January 3rd. What's strange is that something almost exactly like this happened earlier this month, too: on December 14, player counts shot up to around 14,000, hung out there for about two days, and dive bombed again into the hundreds on the 17th.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what's really going on here? The actual answer is that no one <em>really </em>knows. The most prevalent community theory seems to be that it's bots, though why someone would train bots to play Artifact isn't exactly clear. One person suggested someone was training an AI to play the game "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hf87nf/comment/m2agrbz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for shits and giggles</a>" which is perhaps as good an explanation as any. Another person suggested the spikes were due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hqvdjy/comment/m4y3g74/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scam bots increasing playtime in random games</a> in order to make their Steam accounts look legitimate for <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/70E6-991B-233B-A37B" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other purposes</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Hero in Artifact's Call to Arms Release Set</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another theory pointed out by multiple members of the Artifact subreddit is that the spike in players is due to pirates. Because certain video games require Steam authentication, in order to pirate those games, pirates will use the AppID/SDK of a different, free-to-play game to fool Steam into thinking they have a real copy. In this case, it's being suggested they're using Artifact. That said, this theory doesn't entirely hold up, due to the extremely sudden spikes and then drops in activity at very precise times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the actual answer behind Artifact's mysterious player numbers remains a mystery for now. We did reach out to Valve for comment, but did not hear back in time for publication. What is clear at least is that despite the numbers, Artifact itself doesn't seem to be garnering any meaningful, real-world interest eight years after launch and four years after Valve <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/artifact-valve-stops-development-on-struggling-card-game">effectively called it quits</a>, even though the game itself <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/13/artifact-review">was pretty fun at first</a>. At least the bots, if they are indeed bots, in Artifact don't seem to be bothering legitimate players, unlike <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/team-fortress-2-steam-reviews-drop-to-mostly-negative-as-players-plead-with-valve-to-do-something-about-bots">the on-and-off situation over in Team Fortress 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
