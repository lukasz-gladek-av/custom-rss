            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tinybuild-connect-2025-everything-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Indie publisher tinyBuild had their second annual tinyBuild Connect showcase today. IGN streamed the Connect live, and the showcase was packed with reveals of new games and release date announcements. Best of all, you can try almost all of the new games shown today via a playtest or demo — either now, or very soon. If you weren’t able to watch it live or just want a rundown of everything that was shown, we’ve got you covered. Here’s everything we saw during the show:</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Ferocious Is a Survival FPS with Dinosaurs You Can Team Up With</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The showcase opened with a brand-new look at Ferocious<em>,</em> where dinosaurs, mercs, and mechs clash in a lush but lethal survival FPS. The trailer teased the ability to tame apex predators and flip the food chain in your favor. The Steam playtest is live now, so it’s time to find out if you can survive the island’s deadly welcome.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>New Sand Trailer Shows More Desert FPS Action </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">New footage rolled out featuring hulking, customizable “Trampler” walkers stomping across sun-scorched dunes, frantic PvP action, and a confirmation that the extraction shooter will be coming to consoles later this year. A fresh playtest is also on the horizon, so get your squad together and see if you’ve got what it takes to rule the sands.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Trainfort Is a Co-op Survival Game with Guns and Steam Engines</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The world-premiere trailer introduced Trainfort, a co-op survival crafting game where roving dwarf nomads build and drive a steam-powered fortress across a procedurally generated wasteland. The developers are promising that a tactile first-person hand-control system will make every action from chopping trees to assembling your mobile base feel grounded and physical. The playtest for Trainfort also went live right after the show.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Hozy Is a Cozy Living Spaces Restoration Game</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Hozy invites players to restore a forgotten neighborhood, one cozy room at a time. Revealed for the first time during the showcase, the debut trailer showed players scrubbing grime, slapping on fresh coats of pastel paint, and dialing in lighting to turn derelict rooms into homey sanctuaries. Hozy also dropped a public Steam playtest right after the show, so you can already get a taste for its fixer-upper gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>All Will Fall Lets You Build a City That Can Collapse at Any Time</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Physics-based construction meets post-apocalyptic survival in this vertical city builder where every ramshackle tower can topple like Jenga. The team confirmed an open beta for Steam Next Fest on June 9, giving players a chance to stack homes sky-high — or watch them spectacularly crumble. All Will Fall has a demo available on Steam right now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Roguelite Kingdom Builder The King Is Watching Launches This July</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">CarbotAnimations’ tongue-in-cheek trailer revealed a July release window for this unique strategy title, where peasants only work under your royal gaze. Each run tasks you with juggling production, training armies, and adapting to unpredictable events. The playable demo is still available on Steam for those eager to test their royal authority.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Of Ash and Steel Shows Off Its Gothic-Coded Fantasy Open World</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A sweeping world overview trailer showcased sun-bleached fortresses, misty marshlands, and brutal third-person combat that rewards stance-switching finesse. Playtest sign-ups went live alongside the trailer, inviting would-be island wanderers to chart their own, marker-free adventures.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Streets of Rogue 2 Gets a New Gameplay Trailer Where Everything Goes Wrong</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A new trailer proved that everything can go wrong at any moment with this anything-goes sandbox, capping the segment with a confirmation that it hits Steam Early Access in 2025. From hijacking tractors to accident-prone heists, chaos is king in Streets of Rogue 2, and you can check out its demo on Steam right now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Voin Unveils Its Next Major Update Called “Permafrost”</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A new, action-packed devlog unveiled the upcoming “Permafrost” update, promising new frosted realms to carve through and fresh gear to master in this hack-and-slash created by a solo developer. Judging by the slicing, dashing footage, the chill won’t slow the carnage one bit. You can grab Voin with a limited-time discount during tinyBuild’s publisher sale on Steam.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>SpeedRunners 2 Unveils a 64-Player Tournament Mode and Cutthroat Racing Gameplay</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The cult-classic competitive platformer is turbo-charging into the new era. The latest trailer confirmed a massive 64-player tournament mode and showed more cutthroat racing gameplay across some new maps. A Steam playtest will launch this summer, and sign-ups are open now. SpeedRunners 2: King of Speed will launch on PC in 2025, with the console release to follow in 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Duckside Brings Hat-Wearing, Gun-Wielding Duck Extravaganza to Consoles This August</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The new trailer dove onto the screen, confirming that Duckside lands on consoles this August and showing off full-flight PvP mayhem, complete with crafting, base building, hat-wearing ducks, and of course, quack-tical base raids. The game is on sale with a limited-time discount on Steam.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Drill Core 1.0 Releases July 17, Nintendo Switch Version Coming Later This Year</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Become a true Corporate Mining manager in this strategy roguelite builder game.

Time-travel paradoxes be damned — Kingmakers is ready to bring an attack chopper to a sword fight.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-gets-a-free-map-of-iconic-underground-tokyo-location-thanks-to-japanese-government<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Japanese government has released a Minecraft map of the world’s largest underground flood prevention facility. Not only is it free to download, but it lets you explore one of the Tokyo area’s lesser-known iconic locations from the comfort of your home.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel, known as G-Cans for short, is a real-life disaster prevention facility. It is best-known for its “pressure adjustment water tank” — a huge cavernous space with 59 massive pillars. A truly epic looking, boss battle-worthy location, it is G-Can’s most iconic sight, and even has the nickname “underground temple” (chika shinden) in Japan. With bags of atmosphere, it also gets used as a location for music videos, Japanese TV dramas (like Kamen Rider) and movies.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/27/gettyimages-156814649-1748370157380.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The real-life G-Cans. Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In dry seasons, it is possible to tour G-Cans in real life, but thanks to the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT), you can now explore this atmospheric facility in Minecraft too. The ministry have released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKReBv1IRB0&amp;t=5s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video on their official YouTube</a> which briefly summarizes the purpose of G-Cans and shows what it looks like in the blocky world of Minecraft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Minecraft’s free G-Cans map doesn’t just include the facility though — there is also an overground area featuring rivers, homes, and neighborhoods, giving the player a sense of how G-Cans protects people and places in real life. You can also go into the control room and try draining flood water into the shafts to see how it works for yourself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/27/000912066-1748370060929.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Minecraft G-Cans. Image credit: the Edogawa River Office.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">MLIT’s recreation of G-Cans in Minecraft is designed to educate people about the facility and how it prevents disasters. Exploring it, even in Minecraft, also gives the player a sense of how absolutely huge G-Cans is. In real life, G-Cans' concrete tunnels run for over 6km under Saitama Prefecture, part of the Greater Tokyo Area. Its five shafts capture water from flood-prone rivers during Japan’s rainy season (June) and typhoon season (usually around September), before gradually releasing it into the much bigger Edogawa River and Tokyo Bay. Completed in 2006 after over a decade of construction, G-Cans has played a huge role in combating flooding in the area ever since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MLIT’s G-Can’s Minecraft map can be downloaded for free from the official website of the <a href="https://www.ktr.mlit.go.jp/edogawa/edogawa01318.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Edogawa River Office</u></a>, which manages the facility. At least Version 1.21.1 of Minecraft Bedrock Edition or Version 1.21.0 of Minecraft Education Edition are required.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.
