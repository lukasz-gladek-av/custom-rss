Players were combining this with ability-stacking and the Stendahl skill, which deals extreme single target Void damage, to dish out billions of damage, enough to kill the final boss in just one hit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was underwhelming for most of development, so in our final pre-release balance pass, we gave it a big damage boost — and clearly overdid it. It ended up overshadowing most other options,” Sandfall said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We still want you to be able to break the game — and you absolutely still can — but Stendhal was making it a bit too easy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The nerf is included in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s first full hotfix set. While Stendhal is still a strong single-hit skill with great synergy potential, it’s now more in-line with everything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the patch fixes what sounds like a bug that was making Medalum third Lumina doubling all damage in Virtuose Stance, instead of doubling only Burn damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the relevant points from today's patch notes:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed Medalum third Lumina doubling all damage in Virtuose Stance instead of doubling only Burn damage.</li><li>Stendhal: Reduced damage by 40%.</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Maelle Outfits and Haircuts - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur is a breakout hit for Sandfall, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-2-million-copies-sold-after-12-days-on-sale">and has already sold over 2 million copies</a>. It’s worth remembering that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was, alongside Bethesda’s Oblivion Remastered, a day-one Game Pass title. That makes this sales milestone all the more impressive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Bethesda shadow-dropped <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered"><u>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</u></a> amid the launch of fellow role-playing game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, most thought there could be only one winner. However, it turned out that there was plenty of room for both games to succeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has done so well that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/french-president-macron-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-for-creating-one-of-the-best-rated-games-in-history"><u>French President Macron has praised the development team</u></a>.

Return to Silent Hill is an adaptation created out of deep respect for a true masterpiece of a game, Konami’s iconic Silent Hill 2. I hope fans will enjoy and be fulfilled with the experience this new film has to offer."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The film's plot will feel familiar to anyone who played the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-2001"><u>Silent Hill 2</u></a> or the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake"><u>2024 Bloober remake</u></a>. It follows "James (Jeremy Irvine), a man broken after being separated from his one true love (Hannah Emily Anderson). When a mysterious letter calls him back to Silent Hill in search of her, he finds a once-recognizable town transformed by an unknown evil" and "terrifying figures both familiar and new." <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-new-movie-from-original-silent-hill-director-confirmed"><u>It was unveiled in October 2022</u></a>, but it took until May 2024 for us to get our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-movie-first-look-pyramid-head"><u>first glimpse at Return to Silent Hill's version of Red Pyramid Thing</u></a> — AKA Pyramid Head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/silent-hill"><u>Gans' first Silent Hill movie</u></a>, based loosely upon the first game, follows mother Rose as she searches for her missing daughter, Sharon, in a town where it snows during summer. Although the screenplay was written by Oscar-winning writer Roger Avary, who wrote Pulp Fiction, we thought Gans' first adaptation was a mediocre 5/10, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/04/21/silent-hill-2"><u>writing</u></a>: "So there we have it. Our worst fears realized yet again. The video game-to-film genre has endured more than a decade of mediocrity. Silent Hill is probably the smartest and best-looking video game adaptation yet, it just doesn't have much else going for it. After all, video games are about entertainment, and Silent Hill is a chore to sit through."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Silent Hill 2 (2024) Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The second movie, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/silent-hill-revelation"><u>Silent Hill: Revelation</u></a> — which was not directed by Gans but instead by Michael J. Bassett — was based loosely on sequel <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-3">Silent Hill 3</a>. That secured a less favorable 4.5 in our review: "Silent Hill Revelation 3D is an inferior sequel in every way, shape and form, a horror sequel that fails to either intrigue or scare, and one that just might have killed the franchise cold-dead."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Return to Silent Hill is slated to release sometime later this year, with Cineverse promising a "wide theatrical release in America."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.
