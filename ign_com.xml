That came as something of a surprise given the company’s combative relationship with modders in the past.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Celebrity in GTA 5 and GTA Online</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, as part of that relationship, select creators worked with Rockstar to build and supply the new mod superstore as it rolls out "in phases to ensure the best experience for both creators and server owners."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As one happy player <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-the-cfx-marketplace/5369289/14" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>, the official marketplace makes it "much easier to find some trusted creators and hopefully more competition." "Amazing idea! Hope this will be a better way for both creators and server owners to reach more people and find what they need," <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-the-cfx-marketplace/5369289/38" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a> another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, there are hundreds of mods to choose from, some of which are free, and others, most typically bundles, are available for upwards of $450. The <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/7220084-attractions-parks-bundle" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Attractions &amp; Parks Bundle</u></a>, for instance, includes a Theme Park, Water Park, and Maze Bank Theme Bank for $137.99. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, most mods seem to be for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>, but Cfx.re has mods for both Grand Theft Auto 5 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, so we may see more Red Dead 2 mods as the marketplace expands.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto is an enduring juggernaut, with GTA 5 having sold 220 million copies to date. Rockstar is yet to detail how GTA Online will change as a result of November's release of GTA 6, but it seems likely the Cfx Marketplace lays the groundwork for a similar offering in whatever's next for the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also seems in preparation for whatever other plans Rockstar has for monetising GTA RP when GTA 6 comes out. GTA fans had begun speculating about what Rockstar RP servers would look like when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-officially-working-with-gta-roleplay-server-team-sparking-fresh-excitement-about-gta-6"><u>the company announced it was working with Cfx.re back in 2023</u></a>. That excitement then only increased when popular musician Faheem Rashad Najm a.k.a. T-Pain teased in 2024 that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/t-pain-confirms-hes-working-on-gta-6-gta-5-nopixel"><u>he was working on GTA 6</u></a> but had been asked by Rockstar to stop engaging with RP servers like nopixel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Among the variety on sale is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, which has dropped to $44.99 for <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOjKeO?object_uuid=65e13be0-1783-475c-b837-9ccc346f22b9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a56dgk?object_uuid=65e13be0-1783-475c-b837-9ccc346f22b9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/z645kj?object_uuid=65e13be0-1783-475c-b837-9ccc346f22b9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This deal makes for $25 off both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions, and $15 off the Switch version. They won't stay at this price for long, though, as Best Buy's Winter Sale only lasts until January 19. Now is the time to make a move on it if it's been on your radar.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds for $45</h2><div id="234386"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234386" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p><span><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Launch Edition - PlayStation 5</h3></p></span></p></div></span></p></div><div id="234387"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234387" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p><span><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Launch Edition - Xbox Series X</h3></p></span></p></div></span></p></div><div id="234388"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234388" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p><span><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Launch Edition - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></span></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is a game we think is well worth adding to your library. IGN's Jada Griffin had a lot of praise for it in her <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review">review</a>, saying it "fires on all cylinders with a fantastic roster, excellent courses, and lengthy list of customization options." If it sounds like a perfect pick to get you through these winter months, now is as good a time as any to put it in your shopping cart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not the only exciting game deal Best Buy has to offer right now, either. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-winter-sale-video-game-deals-january-2026">Winter Sale</a> also features discounts on Ninja Gaiden 4, Borderlands 4, and quite a few more. The retailer has even dropped the price of the digital and disc Fortnite Flowering Chaos PS5 console bundle, which is a sweet little surprise after holiday sales. Again, it only runs until January 19, so grab your favorites while they're still available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Searching for even more game deals? Amazon also has some great options worth checking out, including offers on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-for-ps5-is-back-to-its-lowest-price-yet-at-amazon">Assassin’s Creed Shadows for PS5</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-ps5-hits-a-new-low-price-at-amazon">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound for PS5</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-gets-a-7-discount-at-both-amazon-and-walmart">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.

The LAPD said the victim was not injured in the incident, which is now under investigation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 59-year-old former star of hit TV series 24 was released after paying a $50,000 bond, and is now due at Los Angeles Superior Court on February 2. Sutherland's representatives have yet to comment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/gettyimages-493241255-1768390912030.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kiefer Sutherland in the premiere episode of 24: Live Another Day.

In film, he starred in The Lost Boys (1987), Stand By Me (1986), and The Three Musketeers (1993).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sutherland voiced and provided motion capture for Big Boss/Venom Snake in Metal Gear Solid 5, replacing David Hayter in a decision that proved controversial with fans. Explaining the decision, Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima said "I wanted Snake to have a more subdued performance, expressed through subtle facial movements and tone of voice rather than words.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sutherland has a history of arrests. In 2007 he was sentenced to 48 days in jail for driving under the influence and violating probation. Two years later, Sutherland was arrested for head-butting Proenza Schouler founder Jack McCollough at the Mercer Hotel in Manhattan. The charges were dropped after Sutherland and McCollough issued a joint statement in which he apologized.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sutherland appeared in last year's Stone Cold Fox alongside Jessica Jones star Krysten Ritter.
