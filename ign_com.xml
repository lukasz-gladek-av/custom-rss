            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-delayed-as-bungie-promises-to-reveal-new-release-date-this-fall<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"...your voice has been strong and clear."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony and Bungie’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> reboot has been delayed to a new, unspecified release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Destiny and Halo developer announced that its previously planned September 23, 2025 release date had been officially removed from the calendar in <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post on its website</u></a>. It’s a message that comes with the promise that an update, as well as a new release date, will be delivered this fall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear,” Bungie said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion. After much discussion within our Dev team, we’ve made the decision to delay the September 23 release.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Marathon delay follows criticism revolving around a Marathon alpha test held in April. The conversation around Bungie’s new take on the live-service, extraction shooter formula has been heated to say the least, so a delay isn’t too shocking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Alpha test created an opportunity for us to calibrate and focus the game on what will make it uniquely compelling — survival under pressure, mystery and lore around every corner, raid-like endgame challenges, and Bungie’s genre-defining FPS combat,” Bungie’s message adds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re using this time to empower the team to create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like Marathon is built around. This means deepening the relationship between the developers and the game’s most important voices: our players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hermen Hulst went as far as to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026">address feedback</a> just last week, calling the response from fans “varied.” His comments also included the promise that the Marathon reboot would get a release date set by March 31, 2026, while assuring naysayers that the company had no intention of repeating <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-wave-goodbye-to-playstation-flop-concord-as-it-goes-dark-maybe-forever"><u>the mistakes</u></a> seen with last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord"><u>Concord</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While no new Marathon release date has been revealed, it appears as though players can at least expect to get their hands on Bungie’s latest by March 2026. In the meantime, the studio has laid out three major points of feedback it plans to address that should leave a better taste in players’ mouths. These include “upping the survival game,” which means more challenging and engaging AI encounters, more tense and strategic combat, and a more rewarding experience overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie adds that players can expect increased visual fidelity across the Marathon experience along with more story to uncover and a darker tone that falls more in-line with the original Marathon universe. The delay also grants the studio the opportunity to add “more social experiences,” including improvements for solo and duo runs as well as proximity chat.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marathon - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“You’ll hear from us again later this Fall when we can share the progress we’ve made, alongside the game’s new release date,” Bungie concluded. “Thank you again for your patience and — much more importantly — your passion. Your continued feedback will help us make Marathon the incredible gaming experience we all know it can be.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-reveals-new-marathon-game-at-playstation-showcase"><u>announced its Marathon reboot in May 2023</u></a> and remained quiet as its development progressed throughout 2024. Trouble arose with the launch of its alpha test along with controversy centered on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-developer-bungie-launches-thorough-review-after-once-again-being-found-to-have-used-work-from-an-uncredited-artist"><u>plagiarized work that had been discovered in Marathon itself</u></a>. As uncertainty has taken over the conversation, many have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-discuss-marathon-developer-bungies-future-after-yet-another-plagiarism-row-rocks-studio-make-no-mistake-this-is-an-existential-struggle-for-bungie-at-this-point"><u>begun to discuss how the impending game launch could impact the future of the studio forever</u></a>.

Packed into Magic's newly released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-where-to-buy-in-stock">Universes Beyond: Final Fantasy set</a>, these reprints aren't just nostalgic; they're in high demand for collectors, with several fetching serious prices on the secondary market.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR: 16 Most Valuable Final Fantasy: Through The Ages MTG Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond just looking incredible, many of these cards are proven staples in multiple formats like Commander. That combination of competitive relevance and collector appeal has already driven prices up, with several cards becoming some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-best-cards-to-chase-and-buy-today">most sought-after in the entire set</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you're opening boosters or tracking down singles, these are the 16 most valuable cards from the Through the Ages collection right now. They're powerful, flashy, and, for longtime fans of both games, pretty irresistible right now. Let's take a look.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>16. Clive Rosfield (Vial Smasher the Fierce)</strong></h3><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223058"><div id="223058" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Clive Rosfield - Vial Smasher the Fierce</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sitting at around $10.20 market, you can get this Commander staple for as low as $9.60, but this shoots up to <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1MRn?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$49.89 for the foil print</a>. I was hoping for a larger red creature to represent Clive, but Vial Smasher fits his fiery personality well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>15. The Emperor, Hell Tyrant (Yawgmoth, Thran Physician)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223057"><div id="223057" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Emperor, Hell Tyrant - Yawgmoth, Thran Physician</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yawgmoth, Thran Physician is a Modern staple (there's a whole deck named after him), so the Emperor art would be a nice addition to die-hard fans of the deck. You can pick this up for around $14.54 market, or as low as <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmnO3j?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$11.99 on TCGPlayer right now</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>14. Kefka's Tower (Bolas's Citadel)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223056"><div id="223056" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kefka's Tower - Bolas's Citadel</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I thought for sure Kefka's Tower would be printed onto Command Tower, but it looks like Wizards of the Coast wanted to avoid Commander-only cards, which is welcome. Get this at market value for $15.55 or as low as $13.69.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>13. Cecil Harvey (Tymna the Weaver)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223055"><div id="223055" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cecil Harvey - Tymna the Weaver</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A personal favorite (seriously, I adore Final Fantasy IV), Tymna, the Weaver's design is another card that fits the flavor of the character well. Find it at market around $16.18.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>12. Lightning, Lone Commando (Isshin, Two Heavens as One)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223054"><div id="223054" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lightning, Lone Commando v- Isshin, Two Heavens as One</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best Mardu Commanders around, Isshin definitely fits Lightning's vibe in terms of combat mechanics. You can pick this up at <a href="https://zdcs.link/z62DYj?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">market price for $21.93</a> but not much lower at the time of writing, as Lightning's value seems to be slowly spiking as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>11. Blessing of the Oracle (Akroma's Will)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223051"><div id="223051" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Blessing of the Oracle - Akroma's Will</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're playing white in Commander, odds are you're running Akroma's Will. The art with Noctis and Lunafreya is one of my personal favorites. It's recently had a massive spike in price, and you can currently find it at market value for around $23.99.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>10. Kefka Palazzo (Purphoros, God of the Forge)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223052"><div id="223052" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kefka Palazzo - Purphoros, God of the Force</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Purphoros, God of the Forge is great in Commander if you're running a tokens or blink strategy, and the Yoshitaka Amano Kefka art is a nostalgic masterpiece. Market is around $25, and that seems to be the price you're looking at right now as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>9. Tidus, Zanarkand Fayth (Thrasios, Triton Hero)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223053"><div id="223053" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tidus, Zanarkand Fayth - Thrasios, Triton Hero</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You'd be hard-pressed to see Thrasios played anywhere other than low-powered Merfolk Commander decks, but the Final Fantasy X cover art is the big selling point here. Get it at market for $21.26 but not much lower.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>8. Cloud Strife (Najeela, the Blade-Blossom)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223050"><div id="223050" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cloud Strife - Najeela, the Blade-Blossom</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Najeela, the Blade-Blossom fits Cloud well, and the Tetsuya Nomura art alone is enough for me to pick one up. <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5wXKL?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Market value is $25</a>, and seems fairly stable right now as well, albeit the foil version fetches 10x that, with listings up to <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAx3j?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$250 at TCGPlayer right now</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>7. The Cloudsea Djinn (Nyxbloom Ancient)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223049"><div id="223049" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Cloudsea Djinn - Nyxbloom Ancient</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I'd call this a fringe Commander staple, as big mana green decks love this massive enchantment creature for some extra ramp, and the Cloudsea Djinn art from the original Final Fantasy is icing on the cake. Find it at market for $24.66 or down to around $23 from select vendors.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>6. Zidane Tribal (Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223048"><div id="223048" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zidane Tribal - Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer might be one of the most annoying one-drops ever printed, but I can't argue against this sweet Zidane alternate art, especially as a huge fan of Final Fantasy IX. Market price is $27.70 and other vendors don't have it for much lower. The foil version is also going for around $82.99 right now as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>5. Terra Branford (Urza, High Lord Artificer)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223047"><div id="223047" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Terra Branford - Urza, High Lord Artificer</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This card is another example of a fan-favorite character glued onto a multi-format powerhouse. It's at $26.62 market value, with that being fairly stable right now as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>4. Knights of San d'Oria (Ranger-Captain of Eos)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223046"><div id="223046" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Knights of San d'Oria - Ranger-Captain of Eos</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ranger-Captain of Eos sees enough Modern and Legacy play to warrant picking this one up. It's at $29.50 market and not much lower elsewhere.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>3. Sephiroth, the Savior (Atraxa, Grand Unifier)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223045"><div id="223045" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sephiroth, the Savior - Atraxa, Grand Unifier</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one I'm surprised at as well, but because of how low it is. Mix Atraxa, Grand Unifier, a multi-format all-star, with one of the most iconic video game villains of all time, and you have potential for a serious price tag. Luckily it's at a $42.78 market price, which could be worse. Find one for as low as $39.98.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>2. Dragon of Mount Gulg (Ancient Copper Dragon)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223044"><div id="223044" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dragon of Mount Gulg - Ancient Copper Dragon</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From a Commander or competitive standpoint, I can't quite figure out why this is as expensive as it is, it's sitting at $72.19 market. But nostalgia is a hell of a drug, so you can <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgr7q?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">grab one for as low as $69.74</a>, break out the big guns as the foil version is up to <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OM4y?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$254.70 at the time of publication</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bonus: Honorable Mentions</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we jump into the most valuable card, consider these honorable mentions when picking up any singles right now as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy: Through the Ages features dozens of other cards, and the above list are some other multi-format staples like Fatal Push and Dovin's Veto with awesome new art that won't break the bank for a playset.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>1. Stay With Me (Rhystic Study)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223042"><div id="223042" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Stay With Me - Rhystic Study</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rhystic Study has been a Commander staple since the format's inception. The Final Fantasy X version is sitting at a market price of $103.12, but you can pick one up for as high as $125.98, or as low as $100.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where Can I Buy Final Fantasy: Through the Ages?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Through the Ages cards can be found non-foil in both Play Boosters and Collector Boosters, with foil versions of the cards only available in Collector Boosters. But, the best avenue to get the cards you want, without spending an absolute fortune, is by purchasing singles, so hopefully this was a handy guide for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you're here for FF6’s Terra, FF7’s Cloud, FF10’s Tidus, or FF14’s Warrior of Light, these sets are stacked with heroes and villains from across the series. And that’s just the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers">Commander Decks</a>, the full release runs deep. If you managed to lock in a preorder before they vanished, congrats. Otherwise, check in with the links just above to bookmark or wishlist your favorite set in anticipation of any restocks soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or perhaps, Collectors with more money than sense might be even more drawn to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-secret-lair">Final Fantasy x Secret Lair drops</a>. Wizards of the Coast has had a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-lair-release-full-release-schedule-2025">packed year of limited-time releases</a>, and all three Final Fantasy Secret Lair sets sold out in record time, leaving plenty of fans empty-handed. That said, they’re still <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn3lV?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">available through third-party sellers</a>... if you’re willing to pay the markup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are three drops in total: Weapons, Grimoire, and Game Over. Each one offers Magic: The Gathering cards with exclusive Final Fantasy art and themed names. All were released in both standard and foil editions, with Japanese-language variants adding an extra layer of rarity for collectors.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/12/where-to-buy-secret-lair-mtg-final-fantasy-ign-1749723561198.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">MTG x Final Fantasy Secret Lair - Credit: Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since these drops are no longer available directly from Wizards of the Coast, don’t expect to find them at their original prices. Standard nonfoil sets launched at <strong>$30, and rainbow foil versions at $40</strong>, but most listings now sit between <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn3lV?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>$80 and $150 or more</strong></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a steep jump, so if you’re looking to grab one now, make sure you know exactly what you’re paying for. You can find them on eBay, but we’ve always found <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn3lV?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGPlayer</a>, while also eBay-owned, to be the more secure and trustworthy option for picking up Secret Lair drops after release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.

That’s true for Lego Party, the mini brick’s seemingly successful attempt to Lego-fy Mario Party so that fans of the tiny constructables can get together in a group of four and proceed to ruin their friendship over minigames.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review">Mario Party</a> you know exactly what to expect for Lego Party. A group of four players will drop onto a boardgame-like table and roll numbers to advance the requisite number of spots. Some spots will have special prizes, some will hide traps that will steal your hard-earned Stars, or in this case, a golden Lego Brick. After every player rolls their turn, they’ll all drop in to compete in one of 60 Lego-themed minigames.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And to Lego Party’s credit, the minigames is where this effort can differentiate itself from Mario Party. There are some standard-fare activities, like a game where players jump over a swinging octopus tentacle until the last player is left standing, to some very off-kilter ones. One I tried is a Bennett Foddy-style unicycle racing game where players must use the joysticks to balance atop a very fiddly unicycle and inch their way towards the finish line. We only played about eight minigames total, so I’m very excited to see what else Lego Party has in store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Lego innovation is how Lego Party leans into the creative aspect of the toy bricks. While the overworld maps are themed after fun concepts like “Pirates,” they can also be modified if certain conditions are met within the game. Landing on a specific spot will let players create unique elements to add to the map like a pirate ship that wasn’t there when the game began.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Visually, Lego Party has the crisp, colorful aesthetic Lego games have come to be known for, though the party game aesthetic means that these Legos lean towards more whacky designs than something I’d consider charming. That is to say, these Legos are all about being zany and loud, which is perfect for the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing with three other players (my two IGN colleagues and a developer), we found ourselves immediately sucked into its playful orbit. The goal is to collect as many Gold Bricks by the end of the game. Winning minigames on their own will only award you Lego bits that you can turn into ways to score Gold Bricks, such as movement modifiers that will help you land on the spot where a Gold Brick has spawned.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’re also traps you can purchase (don’t worry, it’s not in a microtransaction way) to potentially steal Gold Bricks from other players, and unique spots on the board that will initiate a special 2v2 game where the winning team will both get Gold Bricks as a reward. These 2v2 rounds include special minigames where, for example, both players each control one half of a car and must coordinate their controls to drive to the designated goal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we did complete a small game ourselves, we only saw a fraction of what Lego Party has to offer. If the rest of the games are anywhere near as fun as the handful that we played, I can see Lego Party having the kind of addictive appeal Mario Party has had – which is especially good news for PlayStation and Xbox players that don’t have access to Mario Party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
