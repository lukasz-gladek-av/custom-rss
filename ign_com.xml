Patch 1.2 is out now, and alongside fixes and improvements, there's both a barber shop and Steam Workshop modding support added to the massive RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The barber shop is the first of "several" planned free DLCs, per a press release from Warhorse, and will let protagonist Henry visit the barber to change up his hairstyle. There's also an option for either a clean-shaven or rugged appearance, as well as facial hair ranging from stubble to beard. A new haircut will, just like in real life, give Henry a temporary boost to charisma.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 1.2 (massive patch notes below!) addresses over 1,000 fixes and improvements, including equipment and NPC behavior, as well as gameplay balance. Specifically, developer Warhorse Studios tackled country-specific localization as well. The new patch for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 refines the Chinese translations, both Traditional and Simplified, improves the Korean font for clarity, and has a newly recorded French voiceover.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for modding, dedicated Steam modding support has arrived alongside the barber DLC and Patch 1.2. The toolkit allows players to tinker with over 300 elements in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, ranging from user interface and combat mechanics to AI behavior. "Whether making subtle tweaks or complete overhauls, the possibilites for customization are vast," Warhorse said. The studio plans on discussing these updates further during a developer stream, set for March 20, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additional content is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap-sets-stage-for-3-expansions-in-2025">expected to roll out for the historical RPG throughout the year</a>, with its first paid content drop "Brushes with Death" set for this summer. The Legacy of the Forge expansion is expected in autumn, and then this winter, Warhorse aims to release Mysteria Ecclesia, which involves a covert mission in the Sedlec Monastery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest from Warhorse Studios doesn't show any sign of slowing down in sales, either.
