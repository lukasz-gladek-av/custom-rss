Originally set to follow on from Episode 1 and 2, its cancellation instead left the series dangling on a cliffhanger it never directly resolved. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, on the occasion of Half-Life 2's 20th anniversary, Valve has opened up about its development in a brand-new documentary that shows never-before-seen work-in-progress footage, a brand-new Ice Gun, and a raft of new concept art. You can see the gameplay segment from the documentary in the video below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the details shown in the video, Episode 3 would have been set in the Arctic, and it would have focused on Alyx as a companion character. Aside from the Ice Gun, the footage shows a blob-like enemy that could split into multiple parts. According to the documentary, the team had complete a "collection of playable levels in no particular order" and expected to be able to release the game within a year or two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the new gameplay footage, writer Marc Laidlaw, founder Gabe Newell, and others also talk frankly about why it was never released, ultimately chalking it up to a lack of compelling new ideas and other reasons. At one point Laidlaw jokes, "Are we allowed to cry in this documentary?"</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We could have shipped it. It wouldn't have been that hard</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason for Episode 3's cancellation has been the subject of much discussion over the years, not the least because Episode 2 ended on a grim cliffhanger. In an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-explains-why-half-life-2-episode-3-was-never-made">interview with IGN</a> shortly before Alyx's release, Valve level designer Dario Casali described it partly as an issue of scope screep. Laidlaw would later reveal the plot in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/25/half-life-2-episode-3-potential-plot-revealed-by-series-writer">story called "Epistle 3,"</a> featuring "Gertie Freemont" and "Alex Vaunt" — plays on Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/16/half-life-2-20th-anniversary-documentary-1-53-41-screenshot-1731720807178.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Half-Life 2: Episode 3 would have been set in the Arctic and featured an Ice Gun. Image source: Half-Life 2 Documentary.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's possible to detect a lot of regret over the decision not to go through Episode 3. At one point Laidlaw jokes, "Are we allowed to cry in this documentary?" Others talk about how Episode 3 probably could have been released in hindsight. Newell says, "We could have shipped it. It wouldn't have been that hard. My personal failure was being stumped. I couldn't figure out why Episode 3 was pushing anything forward."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve finally released Half-Life Alyx in 2020, sending <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-alyx-ending-explained">the story spinning off in a new direction</a>, but many fans remain wistful about Half-Life: Episode 3 (not to mention the long lost Half-Life 3). Now, 20 years after its release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-2-20th-anniversary-update-includes-developer-commentary-improved-graphics-and-a-2-hour-documentary">Valve is celebrating Half-Life 2</a> amid unconfirmed rumors that a <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-3/leaks-deadlock-details" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new game is in the works</a>. In the meantime, it's worth watching the entire documentary, which delves deep into Half-Life 2's fraught development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image source: Half-Life 2 Documentary / Valve</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

Xbox CEO Phil Spencer is aware of these challenges, and they're one reason he's "not the biggest fan" of committing resources to licensed games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking with the <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game File newsletter</a>, Spencer talked about some of the "complexities" that come with making licensed games, especially when it comes to putting them on subscription or streaming services.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’ve seen it in racing games that have to get delisted, because you lose certain licenses,” Spencer said. “So I'm always very careful, if we're going to take on a license, that we're doing it for creative reasons, [that] the team has a goal around what they want to do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Spencer didn't name it explicitly, Ubisoft has cited "licensing constraints" as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/delisting-the-crew-makes-sense-preventing-it-from-ever-being-played-again-does-not">one of its reasons for delisting The Crew</a>. Xbox's own Forza Horizon games have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-4-will-be-delisted-from-digital-stores-in-december">likewise been delisted</a> due to expiring licenses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which is being developed with input from Lucasfilm Games, Spencer say that MachineGames' passion for the property was reason enough to take on the license.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I think what you see in Indiana Jones is a team that really loves Indiana Jones and that world</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think what you see in Indiana Jones is a team that really loves Indiana Jones and that world. The story is, to me, one of the strongest parts of that game—the way you feel like you're Indiana Jones from a first person perspective," Spencer said. "So it's clear that's something they wanted to do. But, for us, given the [intellectual property] that we have that we own. I'm a big fan of us using the IP that we haven't even revisited.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for whether or not the Indiana Jones license might eventually expire, Spencer said, "I feel great about our partnership with Lucas and Disney, all up, on that. They've been good partners. We're obviously doing <a href="https://substack.com/redirect/957d65d2-2817-46a5-b955-b8e42dc5318f?j=eyJ1IjoiMzhuNGhrIn0.DY9ADcho0T-iaJ3fvV9HkxOuhC3fWjfEONzJi0UR2ck" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blade with Arkane Lyon</a> with them.
