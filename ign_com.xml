Most Roblox experiences have <strong>codes that are case-sensitive</strong>, so if you're not putting the code in exactly as it's written, you'll find it won't work. To make it easier for you to avoid this issue, we'd recommend <strong>copying the code directly from this article</strong>. We test each and every one before we add them, so just be sure you don't copy an extra space before or after the code accidentally! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If your code still isn't working, it might be that it's expired. For reference, in Anime Card Clash, whenever you put in a code incorrectly, it says "Code not found!". </p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Get More Anime Card Clash Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We check for Roblox codes daily, so when a new Anime Card Clash code drops, you can be sure you'll find it here! If you want to track down codes yourself, the <a href="https://discord.gg/animecardclash" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anime Card Clash Discord server</a> is the place to hunt for them. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Anime Card Clash in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In Anime Card Clash the goal is to build the best deck to battle against bosses and other players. You'll start by rolling for cards to craft a unique deck, and we'd recommend taking some time to roll as many times as possible and creating your perfect pack before you jump over to story mode. When you're ready to tackle story mode, you'll engage in turn-based combat against a series of tough bosses. With each defeat, you'll unlock new worlds, so you can put your deck to the ultimate test. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lauren Harper is an Associate Guides Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/steel-hunters-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The World of Tanks studio is taking its fight into the future.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">On paper, Steel Hunters is a serious left turn for World of Tanks developer Wargaming. But just because the developer’s next project is rooted in a sci-fi, futuristic setting with larger-than-life mechs doesn’t mean they’re not tapping into their 27 years of multiplayer expertise for this mech hero shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I spent about 45 minutes racing other mechs to an extraction point in Steel Hunters’ battle royale-lite extraction mode, trying out half of its seven-character launch roster. Although I hit a few snags as I got myself used to controlling a building-size robot shaped like a spider, I could see Wargaming’s multiplayer pedigree on full display.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Steel Hunters - March 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from a short tutorial, which introduced me to Steel Hunters’ movement and controls, I spent all of my time in one mode. This extraction-based mode was kind of like a scaled-down battle royale: a few squads of two are dropped onto a map and sent toward points of interest, picking up helpful stuff along the way. Each mech is fully loaded out with weapons and abilities, so instead of guns or armor like in Fortnite, you’ll pick up various upgrades for your mech’s stats, healing items, and experience points.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you can find some loot in the wild, most of the upgrades and loot you’ll find in-match come from downing nearby NPC drones. These weaker enemies are scattered all over each map and put up just enough of a fight that they’re a pain to deal with if another squad is attacking you as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Different points of interest pop up during the match, giving you and your non-AI opponents something to race toward against each other, creating random chokepoints around helpful supply drops. Eventually, an extraction point gets marked on the map, beckoning all remaining squads towards the final objective. Once you get there, you’ll need to defend the extraction point (or attack it if someone beats you there) for a little while before the match ends.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Players descending on the chokepoint trying to outflank each other using their mechs’ various toolkits to their advantage was always the best part of the matches I played.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This was always the best part of the matches I played, as players descended on the chokepoint trying to outflank each other using their mechs’ various toolkits to their advantage. Maybe the agile Fenris uses their speed to flank an unsuspecting duo as they try to maintain control over the extraction point while the self-healing Razorside draws cover, ducking behind cover to patch themself up. Or maybe the sniper, Heartbreaker, might post up behind the defensive, map-controlling Weaver as they set up defensive barriers to protect their glass cannon teammate.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I played all four of those mechs in different matches, favoring Heartbreaker and Weaver the most. Weaver has this extremely satisfying Gatling gun that just melts enemy health and shields and their movement felt the best. Aiming down sights with Heartbreaker reveals weak points in every enemy, delivering extra reward for patient, precise play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If there was any problem with the demo I played, it was the in-between stuff. While it was fun to pick off weaker enemies, grab their loot, and find other players, the maps all felt a little too big up until the end. I’m certain some of this came from the fact that I was playing against AI-controlled bots in an early build of the game, but that inconsistent pace felt at odds with the relatively quick match times.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To give the team at Wargaming the benefit of the doubt, the studio is a well-oiled multiplayer machine at this point. Just because Steel Hunters trades historical context for futuristic fiction doesn’t mean the studio’s throwing the baby out with the bath water. It’s clear that Wargaming has been through a few multiplayer game launches in the past based on its launch plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting out with a manageable scale for its upcoming early access launch on April 2nd, Steel Hunters is going to launch with 7 playable characters, one mode, and only a few maps to start out—and no monetization. This calculated approach to launch, with the promise of new content every 5-6 weeks, shows this team’s pedigree and tact when it comes to multiplayer games. This approach gives me a lot of faith in Wargaming’s ability to listen to its player base and take feedback as it moves toward an eventual 1.0 release. Wargaming even teased the first new character coming to Steel Hunters post-launch, reiterating its commitment to three-month seasons.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re hoping to hop into Steel Hunters, you won’t have to wait long, as it launches into early access on April 2nd.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Indeed, Ubisoft suffered a number of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed"><u>high-profile flops</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cuts-45-jobs-in-its-us-offices"><u>layoffs</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled"><u>studio closures</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-delays-cancellations-were-because-it-was-making-too-many-games-at-once"><u>game cancellations</u></a> in the run up to Assassin's Creed Shadows' release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things have got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shareholder-plots-protest-outside-paris-hq-accuses-company-of-failing-to-reveal-discussions-with-microsoft-ea-and-others-allegedly-interested-in-acquiring-ips"><u>reportedly exploring talks with Chinese mega-corp Tencent and other investors</u></a> on a buyout deal that would let it preserve control of the company's intellectual property.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, the video game world is watching Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ early performance closely for signs of its success — or failure. So far, Ubisoft has yet to announce a sales figure, but has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-hits-2-million-players-2-days-after-release-ubisoft-says-its-now-surpassed-origins-and-odyssey-launches">Assassin's Creed Shadows hit 2 million players just two days after launch</a>, surpassing the launches of both Origins and Odyssey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a lot of attention on Shadows’ Steam concurrents, which are being compared to those of other triple-A single-player games that recently released, as well as previous Assassin’s Creed games on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows became the most-played Assassin's Creed game ever on Steam over the weekend with 64,825 peak concurrent players, although it’s worth noting that it was the first game in the series to launch day-one there since 2018's Odyssey. BioWare’s single-player RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard"><u>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u></a> saw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to make a call on whether Shadows is below, meeting, or exceeding Ubisoft’s expectations without knowing what those expectations were. But a source from within Ubisoft, who revealed an internal email reviewed by IGN, has helped us better understand the game’s first weekend performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s what we’ve found out: Shadows delivered the second-highest day-one sales revenue in the franchise’s history, behind only 2020’s Valhalla, which launched across the last and current generation of consoles and benefited from stay-at-home gaming fueled by the pandemic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows also marked Ubisoft’s best ever day-one launch on the PlayStation Store, suggesting particular success on PS5.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about PC, given Shadows launched on Steam as well as Ubisoft’s own digital store? According to Ubisoft’s internal communication, 27% of Shadows’ total “activations” were on PC. Ubisoft is telling employees that Steam “played a major role” in Shadows’ performance on PC, without revealing exact sell-through numbers. It says early results “are a strong validation of our decision to return to the platform.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generally, Ubisoft is talking up player engagement, which is at “record levels,” and “feedback across moderated, verified platforms — those less affected by review bombing — remains incredibly positive.” Shadows was also the most-wishlisted Ubisoft game of all time, and it’s doing better than any other Assassin’s Creed game on Twitch, even Valhalla.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s here that Ubisoft’s internal communication provides context on comparisons between Shadows’ launch and other games in the franchise. What’s clear is that Shadows is not doing as well as Valhalla did at launch, but Ubisoft is saying it’s not fair to compare the two, because Valhalla benefitted from the “perfect storm” of pandemic-fueled stay-at-home gaming and the launch of the Xbox Series X and S and PlayStation 5 in 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Valhalla launched under extraordinary conditions — in the middle of a global pandemic, with widespread lockdowns and brand-new console hardware,” the internal communication reads. “It was a perfect storm we may never see again. That’s why it’s more meaningful to compare Shadows to entries like Origins, Odyssey, and Mirage — games released in more typical cycles. And in that frame, Shadows is already setting a new bar as illustrated above.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft also pointed out that Shadows released in March. Historically, Assassin’s Creed games launch just ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving window, which typically boosts sales. Meanwhile, Ubisoft ditched the early access period it normally charges extra for with its games. It’s also worth noting that Ubisoft’s own subscription offering is now available directly on Xbox, which affects sales on Microsoft’s console and muddies sales comparisons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Money talks, of course, and irrespective of player numbers and engagement, it will be revenue brought in by Assassin’s Creed Shadows that determines the fate of not just the game, but Ubisoft itself. We may not get a clear picture of that until Ubisoft's next financial report in the coming months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adventuring across feudal Japan?
