He most recently hung out with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ZWKbHKCUkpw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinda Funny Games</a> for a chat and was asked if there was a favorite game of his that was pitched but never made, to which he gave his answer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, I’ll share one. Resistance 4.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Price, he and the developers “did pitch that one and it was a wonderful concept, and it just in terms of timing and market opportunity, didn’t work out.” He added that the Insomniac team were “passionate about extending the story further because I do believe that Resistance has set up a really cool alternate history base where anything can happen with the Chimera and where they go and what their origins are.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resistance is a series of first-person shooters Insomniac developed following their work on the Ratchet and Clank games. Set in an alternate history where aliens invade the UK in 1951. There were three Resistance games made, all for the PlayStation 3 before Insomniac moved on to other projects like Marvel’s Spider-Man and new Ratchet and Clank games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Price announced earlier this year that he will be retiring from Insomniac Games after over 30 years at the company. He has named Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider, and Jen Huang as Co-Studio Heads who will succeed him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac Games’ most recent title was Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 which just received a PC release, and their next game is set to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-have-to-be-like-logan-today-and-remain-very-stoic-insomniac-quiet-on-whether-wolverine-will-make-2025">Marvel’s Wolverine</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the meantime, no other platforms are reporting outages so it appears specific to PSN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

There's something so satisfying about holding a guitar controller and feeling like I'm actually playing songs that I would never dream of playing on a real guitar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While my own Rock Band days ended a long time ago, the music goes on with the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/05/rock-band-4-review">Rock Band 4</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-festival-review">Fortnite Festival</a>. And if you want to keep playing those games or get back into them, PDP released a new wireless guitar controller just last year that can help you do that. It's pretty expensive, but Amazon has just dropped the price to a new low with a 20% discount.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PDP Riffmaster Wireless Guitar Controller Sale</h2><div catalogid="1620c457-409e-42b8-91af-d7f30570614f" id="214952"><div id="214952" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PDP Riffmaster Wireless Guitar Controller</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When this controller first came out back in May 2024, it sold out very quickly. This is largely because there just aren't really any new guitar controller options available outside of this one. The compatibility with Rock Band 4 and Fortnite Festival allow new and old players to experience an upgrade that feels more in line with modern controllers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it is normally priced at $129.99, the discount Amazon is running right now drops that down to $104. This is the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CWS8WKS5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest-ever price we've seen on Amazon</a> for the PlayStation compatible version of this controller, and likely the lowest one we'll see until <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-sales-events">sales events later in the year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is a fairly unique controller, it's the overall <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-controller">best PS5 controller</a> you can buy if you're looking to play Rock Band 4 or Fortnite Festival on your PS5 or PS4.
