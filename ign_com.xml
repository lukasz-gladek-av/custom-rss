            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-state-of-play-reportedly-set-for-next-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It's a Marathon, not a sprint.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is reportedly set to deliver its now-standard February PlayStation State of Play broadcast next week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaker NateTheHate, who accurately revealed the date of Nintendo’s Switch 2 reveal ahead of time, took to social media to <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1885748440132456877" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tease</a> a State of Play for Valentine’s Day week (February 10 to 14).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s speculation time! What could Sony have up its sleeve for this year’s State of Play? It’s worth going through the first-party games it has announced and coming out in 2025. Sucker Punch’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> currently has a 2025 release window. Perhaps we’ll get a fresh look at gameplay and a release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Bungie’s PvP extraction shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> may be set for a showing if it still plans to open playtesting up this year. There’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgames</a>, the debut game from Haven Studios. Naughty Dog recently announced its brand new IP, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet"><u>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</u></a>, and Insomniac is working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Marvel’s Wolverine</a>. More likely, perhaps, is a fresh trailer for Hideo Kojima’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, which is set for a 2025 release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What we won’t see are the various live service games Sony recently canned. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony canceled two unannounced live-service games that were in development at Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games</u></a>. The Bluepoint game was reportedly a live-service God of War game. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bend-studio-dev-says-we-still-plan-on-creating-cool-st-after-sony-live-service-cancelation">Bend Studio’s live-service game remains unknown</a>. Guerrilla Games' live service Horizon game reportedly survived the cull. Is it finally time for a reveal?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to potential third-party announcements, Kojima has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project"><u>Physint</u></a>, the upcoming stealth-action PlayStation exclusive in the works, but it feels a little early for that. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phantom-blade-zero"><u>Phantom Blade Zero</u></a>, the flashy hack-and-slash action RPG from Chinese studio S-Game, is a safer bet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And let’s not forget Microsoft, now a significant publisher of games on PlayStation. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is set to launch on PS5 soon, so maybe we will see a release date announced. And could Microsoft use State of Play to finally announce <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-finally-looks-set-to-make-the-jump-to-playstation-this-year">the arrival of Halo on PlayStation</a>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In predicting the future, it’s helpful to look to the past. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-january-2024-everything-announced">Last year’s equivalent State of Play</a> showcased the likes of Death Stranding 2, Physint, Rise of the Ronin, the Until Dawn remaster, Stellar Blade, Dragon's Dogma 2, Sonic x Shadow Generations, various Silent Hill projects, Ken Levine’s Judas, Foamstars, and Helldivers 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-devs-looking-to-improve-trading-following-major-player-backlash<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> developer Creatures Inc. is "actively investigating ways to improve" the trading feature which launched last week to major backlash from players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. released a statement on <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1885447974094070090/photo/1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> that thanked players for their feedback and said they planned the controversial trading feature with the intention of stopping players from abusing it, but "some of the restrictions put in place are preventing players from being able to casually enjoy" it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also promised to alleviate complaints by introducing required items as rewards in upcoming events, but has already failed to do so as the Cresselia ex Drop Event released today, February 3, includes none.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the standard Pokémon TCG Pocket mechanic that restricts players from opening packs or Wonder Picking or, now, trading too much without spending real world money, the feature was also introduced with an extra restriction called Trade Tokens. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-trading-today-and-players-absolutely-hate-it">Players criticized the high cost of obtaining these</a>, as they essentially had to delete from their collections five cards before trading one of the same rarity.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Space Time Smackdown</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The item requirements and restrictions implemented for the trading feature were designed to prevent abuse from bots and other prohibited actions using multiple accounts," Creatures Inc. said. "Our goal was to balance the game while maintaining a fair environment for all players and preserving the fun of collecting cards that is core to the Pokémon TCG Pocket experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"However, thanks to your feedback, we understand that some of the restrictions put in place are preventing players from being able to casually enjoy the feature as intended. We are actively investigating ways to improve the feature to address these concerns. Going forward, we also plan to offer multiple ways to obtain Trade Tokens including through event distributions."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement is essentially as vague as it gets, with Creatures Inc. offering neither specifics into what changes will be made or when they will arrive, but it at least confirms that community concerns are heard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players of Pokémon TCG Pocket are also left in the dark as to if their current trades will be refunded or compensated in any way, as if the Trade Token cost changes, those taking advantage of the feature in its opening days may lose much more than if they waited.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. doesn't seem particularly determined to include Trade Tokens in events either, as it only made a total of 200 available as premium rewards to those who pay $9.99 a month for the Battle Pass when the refresh arrived on February 1. This is enough to trade a single 3 Diamond card, the lowest rarity that requires Trade Tokens to trade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also failed to include any as rewards in the aforementioned Cresselia ex Drop Event which arrived today. Players can pick up new promo cards, Pack Hourglasses, Shinedust, shop tickets, and experience from completing the events, but Creatures Inc. doesn't offer a single Trade Token despite its vow to do so just yesterday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans complained trading is fairly clearly being implemented as a means of increasing revenue for Pokémon TCG Pocket, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">is estimated to have made $200 million in its first month</a>, before trading was possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is also evidenced by the inability to trade cards of 2 Star rarity or higher, as if players could immediately trade for their missing cards, they wouldn't need to spend $10 or $100 or more for a random chance of getting them. It cost one player around $1,500 just to complete the first set, for example, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-space-time-smackdown-expansion-today-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">the third in three months arrived just a few days ago</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players called the mechanic "predatory and downright greedy," "hilariously toxic," and a "monumental failure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

It means so much.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is the 3D remake of the first game in the Wizardry series. 1981’s medieval fantasy Wizardy is considered the first party-based video game RPG ever released, and is credited as inspiring the likes of Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is built directly on top of the original game's code. You can even view the original Apple 2 interface as you play.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/03/gettyimages-2196802600-1738578849127.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Winifred Phillips at the 67th Grammy Awards. Photo by Rich Polk/Billboard via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Phillips took home the prize ahead of big hitter nominees including Wilbert Roget, II for Ubisoft’s Star Wars Outlaws, John Paesano for Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Bear McCreary for God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla, and Pinar Toprak for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://youtu.be/NShT8a-9ME8?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a follow-up interview</a>, Phillips said she was “blown away.” “I really didn’t expect it," she added. "The category was populated with so much brilliance this year, and I have so much deep respect for the other nominees in this category. So to have been recognized is just a highlight of my career. It truly is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We do a very unique thing," Phillips continued. "We’re creating music that needs to accompany people who are having an experience and who are making choices, and having adventures and living a grand story, and we’re creating the music for that story. It’s such a wonderful privilege because you feel like you’re collaborating with the players. Like you know them and they know you. It’s really very special.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Previous winners of the coveted award include Stephanie Economou for Ubisoft’s Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab for Respawn’s Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. The first piece of music from a video game ever to be nominated for and win a Grammy in any category was Baba Yetu, a song arranged by Christopher Tin for Firaxis’ Civilization 4, which won Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2011.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
