            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">There's nothing exciting here, but it's still more content for a great game.</h2></div><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin’s Creed expansions come in two flavors: straightforward follow ups that elaborate on the drama and intrigue of the main game, or completely bonkers flights of fancy that turn everything upside down by adding unicorns or dragging you to Asgard. Shadows’ expansion, Claws of Awaji, is firmly the former, almost to a fault. Naoe gets some new combat tricks thanks to a whole new weapon type, and the general pace of exploration is made more hectic and tense as enemies are way more dangerous and way more motivated to bring the fight to you. But the land itself doesn’t feel much different than the rest of Japan, and the straightforward adventure is light on revelation and doesn’t make too great a case for its own existence.</p>The story that carries our heroes off of the mainland and onto the island is much like that of the main game, filled with colorful characters and a shadowy group of conspirators that need to be brought down systematically, but it’s a simple and predictable tale on the whole. It does pick up the threads of Naoe’s missing mother and the growing influence of the Templar order in Japan, but it doesn’t do much to tie those up in satisfying ways by the end. It also doesn’t make much of a case for seeing anymore of this world. For all Valhalla’s faults, each expansion felt like it was introducing a new dimension to the greater world that Eivor and friends occupied. Claws ends, and 16th century Japan doesn’t feel much bigger than it did 10 hours before it.<output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Awaji Island is just as beautiful as the rest of Japan, but it’s not so significantly different from the mainland that a person who hasn’t already spent 60+ hours playing would be able to spot the difference at first glance, unlike when Eivor went to Ireland in Valhalla, for instance. Awaji is a bit more mountainous, which is more noticeable when having to navigate up and down the length of the map because of the significant lack of fast travel points throughout. And there are some visual gems hidden away like a dark swamp with creepy foliage, or a big warship that’s under construction. But if you’ve seen a mountain caked in winter snow earlier this year, this will look exactly like that. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you’ve seen a mountain caked in winter snow earlier this year, this will look exactly like that.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s more of the same kinds of side quests and activities to do on Awaji as well, which is good for gaining knowledge points to invest in the limited amount of new skills and upgrades available to Naoe and Yasuke, but still pretty optional and ignorable otherwise. Side quests seem even more tucked away than the main game – I didn’t come across any of them organically and had to put extra effort into finding people with problems I can solve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naoe gets her hands on a new weapon in Claws of Awaji, the bo staff. Fashioned as a hybrid of a long-ranged crowd controller and a single-target mix-up machine, I found it to be much better at the latter than the former. This is mostly because of its novel stance-based attacks, using high jabs to interrupt enemies and low sweeps to take them off their feet and open them up to big, reliable damage. On the off chance I got into extended brawls as the Shinobi, the bo was reliably my second slot choice.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are new skills for both Yasuke and Naoe, but I didn’t find them to be particularly spicy.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are new skills for both Yasuke and Naoe as well but I didn’t find them to be particularly spicy enough to unseat my tried-and-true staples tested under dozens of hours of chopping and stabbing. Some new equipment is available to plunder from castles but as it was in the base game, these aren’t really much of a carrot worth chasing unless you really love having all of the icons on the map cleared.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The island of Awaji is thick with opportunities to put all of your skills and gear to the test. It’s dense with folks who at best don’t trust you, or at worse would travel far and wide for a chance to kill you. I felt I was being hunted and conspired against much more than in the base game. Every horse trip longer than 100 meters left me exposed to road traps set by enemy ninja. City guards are much jumpier and more suspicious, and will not hesitate to start a melee in the middle of the market to take you down. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The general chaos of the island cleverly married with the main quest’s objectives.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I liked how the general chaos of the island cleverly married with the main quest’s objectives to take down the three trusted taisho of the Templar leader in the region. For instance, those road side ninja? They work for Nowaki, a gun-toting hunter that is terrorizing the region for sport. Stopping to take them out instead of avoiding them gives you the chance to run their pockets for clues to where their master might be hiding. Those jumpy guards all answer to Tomeji, the beefy vanguard that enforces order with an iron fist. He’s very conspicuous in a castle surrounded by his elite guard but picking fights and causing general ruckus will compel him to send those guards out to stop you. And when they don’t return on account of you retiring them early, he’s left more and more vulnerable to your inevitable siege. Using your scouts to track down objectives will put the search zone on high alert thanks to the third big bad on the island: a shadowy spymaster of a thousand aliases. It’s a strange harmony that might have been obnoxious in the larger adventure but is a welcome challenge when considering Claws’ relative brevity.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Jarrett Green's Top 10 Assassin's Creed Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When the main quest missions come to crescendos that require the team to work together more directly, Claws of Awaji still splits the tasks up between Yasuke and Naoe appropriately, leaving Yasuke to do much of the open combat, and Naoe to take stealth and assassination duty. The handful of new boss fights also do a good job of playing to the pair's individual strengths, including a very cool stealth battle that kind of evokes Metal Gear Solid and demands all of Naoe’s skills to overcome.
</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Assassin's Creed Shadows brought some much needed promise and energy that the series was lacking, and the Claws of Awaji expansion doesn’t really move that needle much in either direction. Its forgettable story and lack of new interesting side distractions don’t detract from how fun it is to ride through the tumultuous badlands of the region using brute force and subterfuge to take down yet another dark cabal of evil doers. But it doesn’t make the strong case for the necessity of any more epilogues, either.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div data-cy="review-content"><p>okay</p><p>The Claws of Awaji doesn't add anything exciting to Assassin's Creed Shadows, but it's still fun to explore a new region and stab people.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Randy Pitchford has continued his social media push to address complaints about the performance of the PC version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, telling some disgruntled players they can get a Steam refund if they’re unhappy with the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Borderlands 4’s huge Steam launch last week, Pitchford has issued <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/randy-pitchford-addresses-borderlands-4-console-fov-slider-complaints-theres-some-dreams-i-have-where-an-fov-setting-might-affect-fairness"><u>confusing comments on why the console version of Borderlands 4 lacks a field of view (FOV) slider</u></a>, promised <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-am-that-confident-randy-pitchford-says-its-impossible-for-borderlands-4-players-to-break-the-games-servers-this-weekend-challenges-them-to-try"><u>that it would have been impossible to break the Borderlands 4 servers through sheer weight of player numbers alone</u></a>, told people to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/code-your-own-engine-and-show-us-how-its-done-randy-pitchford-goes-on-the-offensive-as-borderlands-4-pc-performance-row-intensifies">“code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please,”</a> and declared Borderlands 4 “a premium game made for premium gamers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s the truth of the matter? Borderlands 4 is currently on a mixed Steam review rating, with most of the negative comments revolving around performance. The tech experts at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> have said <a href="https://youtu.be/2v1ST5qMoaY?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their initial analysis of Borderlands 4 on PC</a> shows significant stutter problems, and have advised against running the game on its ‘Badass’ graphics setting, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-borderlands-4-on-pc-runs-worse-than-usual-for-an-unreal-engine-5-game-advise-against-badass-setting">which suggests there are indeed problems with the Unreal Engine 5 title</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the outspoken Gearbox chief is showing no signs of backing down, issuing tweet after tweet in response to direct complaints about how Borderlands 4 runs. Most of the tweets offer direct advice about how to make Borderlands 4 run better - which is of course a perfectly reasonable thing to do - and call for players to put their irrational distrust of video game graphics tech such as DLSS aside and use it if available to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Pitchford, perhaps showing a touch of frustration about the discourse around Borderlands 4, has issued some spicier responses, pointing to the Steam refund system so players can get their money back, or suggesting fans wait for the game to be cheaper — or more powerful PC hardware to come out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not trying to argue either,” Pitchford said in one of his tweet responses. “I was offering to help you if you are not satisfied with your experience and want some help making trade offs. I'm trying to help users understand that the software is the software and there are options available right now for people who want to play right now to make significant and dramatic trade offs between fps, resolution, and graphics features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's for people who want to play now. People who want to play later can play later. People can even get a refund after buying and trying if they are not satisfied. Those are the options. My advice to users is to accept reality and tune, or to not play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are working more on the software, but the software will not radically change later. However, hardware will get better (just like some or all of your hardware probably didn't exist when Cyberpunk first launched). Do you feel you need help to achieve the trade-offs you're looking for? What kind of hardware are you using and what resolution are you trying to run at and what frame rate is acceptable to you?”</p><div id="borderlands-vault-hunters-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands' Vault Hunters, Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands' Vault Hunters, Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are other posts worth highlighting here because they give us an insight into Pitchford’s current mindset. After one person said he was being “unbelievably insufferable,” a non-plussed sounding Pitchford replied: “I'm trying to be helpful. What do you think would be helpful? What would you have me do?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It looks like some PC gamers don’t like being told to use the likes of DLSS and frame generation generally to improve the performance of Borderlands 4 — and this is something Pitchford seems particularly keen to address. In multiple tweets he suggested playing with the aid of frame generation, although clearly this advice is falling on deaf ears.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You can do whatever you want,” <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967829418275172510" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitchford said in response to yet another complaint</a>. “The game is the game. Please get a refund from Steam if you aren't happy with it.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/16/gettyimages-2165616825-1758023724911.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Gearbox chief Randy Pitchford is tweeting through Borderlands 4's PC performance backlash. Photo by Leon Bennett/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then a typically evocative quote from the Gearbox boss: “You made an analogy to a vehicle. I would not put a Ferrari engine in a monster truck and expect it to drive like a Ferrari. If you tell me about your specification, I can help you optimize your performance. I'm sorry you don't like being told to use DLSS, but that is the way. If you're not happy using the tools available to you to improve frame rate and you're not happy with the frame rate you have, you should play a different game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The game is awesome and it is designed to be just fine of an experience at 30fps and feel great at 60fps. We also have provided a lot of options for you to make different trade offs between frame rate, resolution, and graphics features than we would make and we encourage you to use those tools to optimize to your taste. Would you like help tuning your experience better to your liking?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967842598586028207" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another spicy take from the developer</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Do you want any help tuning your experience? Your other option is to not play or wait for future updates or newer hardware to come along down the road. The game will probably be cheaper in a couple of years, too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967830314983768368" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“UE5 is the engine for Borderlands 4. There's nothing that can change that now. Shader compiling is necessary when you make changes to your graphics settings. I wish it was faster, but it is what it is. When you're done and set up, you won't have to wait the few moments for shaders to compile any more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don't believe I have denied any particular issues (except, generally, to say that the software is functioning as designed and is free from major defects that affect performance for the vast majority of configurations). What I have done and continue to do is recommend that users who want to play the game now and change the trade off between fps, resolution and graphics features take advantage of the tools provided to tune those things to your liking. Would you like help tuning your experience on your specific PC?”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And so on and so forth. Is Pitchford causing more harm to Borderlands 4 than good here? Last month, I asked Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Gearbox parent company Take-Two, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-strauss-zelnick-says-borderlands-chief-randy-pitchford-can-be-controversial-at-times-sometimes-intentionally-sometimes-unintentionally-but-i-still-love-him-to-death">whether he has a mini heart attack whenever Pitchford tweets anything</a>. In his response, Zelnick admitted Pitchford can be a controversial figure, and even suggested some of his antics are deliberate, but ultimately he’s a big fan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I love Randy, first of all. Let me just say that on the record,” Zelnick began. “And I love his big personality. I love his passion and he is one of the all time great game makers. He also can be controversial at times — sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally. I still love him to death.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of all this is that Gearbox is continuing to improve Borderlands 4 generally and PC performance specifically (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-update-to-help-improve-stability-for-a-wide-range-of-pcs-released-but-there-are-no-patch-notes"><u>there’s an update out although no-one knows what it did</u></a>). Gearbox has posted a Borderlands 4 Nvidia Optimization guide on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/679602429802577921" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>, advising players how to optimize their graphics settings for “better performance and framerates” on PC with the Nvidia app, although users report mixed results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has also issued a piece of advice to PC gamers that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-asks-pc-gamers-to-keep-playing-for-at-least-15-minutes-after-they-tweak-settings-to-see-how-performance-has-changed-as-negative-steam-reviews-pile-up"><u>to me reads like an effort to prevent players from making knee-jerk reactions to the game's performance as soon as they’ve changed their settings</u></a>: “Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile. Please keep playing for at least 15 minutes to see how your PC's performance has changed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.

And now the build is spreading like wildfire, fans are convinced Gearbox will soon nerf it into the ground. So, as NickTew suggested: “abuse it while you can.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To make this build work you need the Vampiric Vivisecting Throwing Knife with the Penetrator Augment. Land a hit with this knife and subsequent damage to the target are automatic critical hits for five seconds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the trick: add bleed stacking and each tick of the bleed effect registers as a critical hit. Yep, every one is a crit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s brilliant for every class, but it’s even better for <a href="https://maxroll.gg/borderlands-4/build-guides/vex-leveling-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vex</a> because of her Bloodletter passive. This makes your gun and skill critical hits have a chance to apply bleed, which counts as gun damage and is based on the initial damage dealt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vex's Contamination passive adds to the carnage, because it causes critical hits to increase status effect application chance up to 100%, ensuring the bleed re-procs infinitely. So, throw the knife, land one big shot on the boss, and watch the numbers get bigger and bigger as the bleed ticks it down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NickTew nukes a boss with a level 32 weapon on the Ultimate Vault Hunter Level 5 difficulty, just to show how effective the build really is. This difficulty means enemies have an additional 350% HP, and the boss still goes down in seconds.</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem is, a knife with this augment is a rare find (hopefully you didn't sell or drop one you picked up early game!), so you’ll probably need to do some farming to get it (Splashzone seems like a good shout). Once done, though, the build is essentially complete.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.

It just trivialises the game to the point that the guns don’t even matter anymore. Just apply the penetrator debuff and bleed and then watch it go exponential in damage. Probably not an interaction the devs picked up on in balance testing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has a lot to contend with right now, including improving performance (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/code-your-own-engine-and-show-us-how-its-done-randy-pitchford-goes-on-the-offensive-as-borderlands-4-pc-performance-row-intensifies">while Randy Pitchford tweets through it</a>), adding a field of view (FOV) slider to the console version, and working on post-launch content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
