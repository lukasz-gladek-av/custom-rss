Starting today, you can pick up an official Microsoft Xbox Series X|S wireless controller for as low as $34.99 after you apply coupon code "<strong>PLAYXBOX</strong>". </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seven different color schemes are on sale right now. Most of them are $39.99, however the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QODr6j?object_uuid=89f7cad3-7ec0-47ff-92e8-eff3ce8cebba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Velocity Green controller</a> is $5 cheaper than the rest at $34.99.

Leading up to the big event, retailers will begin to open deals online. This usually <strong>starts in the last week of October</strong>, just before Halloween. Each week leading up to the event will slowly roll out more deals, which ultimately leads to massive discounts on Black Friday. Retailers will not reveal their biggest Black Friday deals until the big day, but most general deals will be available well in advance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
