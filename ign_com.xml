Call of Duty? Halo? Which Xbox franchise do you think is the greatest? Rank them here.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After a strong Xbox Developer Direct to kick 2025 off, things are looking good for Microsoft and its strong stable of first-party studios. But, which Xbox game series get you most excited? Which gave you more enjoyment than any other in the glory days of the 360? Or if you’ve never owned an Xbox console, which are you most looking forward to coming to other platforms like PlayStation, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-starfield-coming-out-on-ps5-phil-spencer-wont-rule-it-out">Microsoft seemingly continues its plans to share its library with the world</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are many legendary game series to choose from (especially since Microsoft’s acquisitions of both Bethesda and Activision Blizzard. That means this tier list can include any series associated with Xbox, Bethesda, and Activision Blizzard, as long as there has been more than one entry into it so far – sorry to MachineGames and Indiana Jones! Give us a sequel, please, and then you can make the cut. Just a reminder that this isn’t an <em>all </em>Xbox Game Series list, so we haven’t involved every single Xbox game series here, but have tried to cover the bases of current relevance and historical impact. Take a look at my personal tier list, based completely on what I’ve enjoyed playing the most over the years, here:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/27/screenshot-2025-01-27-at-13-31-16-1737984696270.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Simon Cardy's Xbox Games Series Tier List</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom is an easy S-tier pick for me, with the past couple of entries being amongst my favourite first-person shooters, and I’m very excited to see that Doom: The Dark Ages looks like id Software is maintaining form. I’ve also placed Forza Horizon in the S tier as they’re, perhaps outside of Burnout 3 and Burnout Revenge, the best racing games I’ve ever played. I’m sure Halo in the A tier may raise a few eyebrows, but while 2 and 3 are two of the finest campaign shooters ever made, I can’t ignore more recent inconsistencies and put it in that top bracket. I’m also more of a Fallout person than an Elder Scrolls one. I’d rather own a set of power armour than a dragon, OK?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t agree with me? Think Gears of War is Xbox’s best? A big defender of Fuzion Frenzy? Well, why not have a go at ranking all of the Nintendo consoles yourself in a tier list below where you can compare your own S, A, B, C, and D tiers with the whole of the IGN community.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Is there an Xbox series we’ve missed that you’d like to give a shout-out to?
