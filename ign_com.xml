There are three new maps, special events, and a new Doom Match game mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Battle Pass includes "over double the content" of the Season 0 pass, NetEase said, with the Luxury Pass featuring 10 new costumes for the heroes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The three new maps include Sanctum Sanctorum and Empire of Eternal Night: Midtown, which arrive in the first half of the season, and Central Park, which will be added in the second half.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Doom Match puts 8-12 players in factions on a single map. Players begin in different parts of the map and earn points by knocking out enemies. Whichever faction includes the top 50% of players wins.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase has published the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-confirms-nerfs-and-buffs-coming-with-season-1-balance-changes">Marvel Rivals Season 1 patch notes</a> early, revealing all the nerfs and buffs coming to the cast of playable characters.

The free-to-play superhero team-based PvP shooter launched on December 6 across PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, and while Sony and Microsoft do not make player numbers public, Steam makes Valve stats available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, Marvel Rivals peaked over its launch weekend with 480,990 concurrent players, which was enough to put it in the top five most-played games on Valve's platform. It’s the 20th highest concurrent player number ever seen on Steam, ahead of the likes of Helldivers 2, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Destiny 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review"><u>Marvel Rivals Review</u></a> to find out what we think.

Amazon is offering two INIU branded power banks at just over $10:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/916gNR?object_uuid=83d313b0-328b-4448-a905-abcfc873ff09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">INIU 10,000mAh 22.5W USB Power Bank</a> for $11.59 with code: "<strong>CCPUVQ4A</strong>"</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/znXLrG?object_uuid=83d313b0-328b-4448-a905-abcfc873ff09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">INIU 10,000mAh 22.5W USB Power Bank</a> for $12.58 with code: "<strong>L6FIOIAI</strong>"</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">INIU power banks generally have very good reviews and are considerably less expensive than equivalent Anker models. These two models have the same battery capacity and power delivery output, but the $11.58 model has two USB Type-C and one USB Type-A ports. The $12.58 model has one USB Type-C and two USB Type-A ports and a battery indicator.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">INIU 10,000mAh 22.5W Power Banks</h2><div id="213945" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="97fbf52d-392a-4fd5-b10f-ab8444983cbb"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU 10,000mAh 22.5W Power Bank</h3></p></div><div catalogid="97fbf52d-392a-4fd5-b10f-ab8444983cbb" id="213946"><div id="213946" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU 10,000mAh 22.5W Power Bank</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two reasons why these power banks serve as great battery backups for your Nintendo Switch console: capacity and charging rate. A 10,000mAh (37Whr) power bank can charge a Nintendo Switch OLED from completely empty to full about 1.9 times while still managing a slim footprint. Provided you fully charge your Switch from the get-go, that nearly triples your total playtime. Both power banks also boast a 22.5W charging output over USB Type-C. The Nintendo Switch console accepts a maximum charging rate of 18W, which is the charging rate of the official Nintendo charger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a power bank this small, you don't need to worry about being stopped at airports. The 10,000mAh capacity is well below TSA's 27,000mAh carry-on limit. Both power banks also also low-profile enough that no one will take notice in the first place. If a TSA official actually does take the initiative to test the wattage, you are well in the clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for more options?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-confirms-nerfs-and-buffs-coming-with-season-1-balance-changes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals Season 1 balance changes are nearly here, and NetEase Games has revealed details that promise tweaks for popular heroes like Captain America, Cloak &amp; Dagger, and Jeff the Land Shark.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team detailed its reasoning for the buffs and nerfs that will soon be delivered with version 20250110 in <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250108/41548_1205103.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post on its website</u></a>. Despite having launched only last month, NetEase says it’s happy with the “vibrant diversity of lineups” it has seen this far but still sees some room for improvement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hence, in the first half of Season 1, we are set to make balance adjustments to certain heroes, enabling a broader roster to partake in more intricate gameplay, ensuring a richer, more engaging, and diverse gaming experience for all,” the team explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the balance tweaks arriving in the first half of Marvel Rivals Season 1 include slight nerfs to a few of the more dominant heroes in the roster. Hulk’s Indestructible Guard gamma shield is going from 250 to 200 health, while Hela will be hit with a base health reduction that brings her from 275 to 250. Hawkeye is also getting a decrease to his medium-long range damage alongside a slight increase to his close combat resistance. Then there's Luna Snow, whose ultimate ability will now take longer to switch from damage to healing.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The list of heroes set to benefit from buffs, meanwhile, is quite long, with Cloak &amp; Dagger, Storm, Punisher, Moon Knight, and more due improvements in some form. Captain America is getting some of the more substantial balance adjustments, with NetEase aiming to enhance his survivability. Jeff’s Joyful Splash healing is also getting an increase from 140/s to 150/s, while the team has also moved to make his ultimate ability warning marker line up better with its actual radius.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-details-the-fantastic-four-new-maps-and-mode-coming-in-season-1">Marvel Rivals Season 1</a> launches this Friday, January 10.

Servers go offline during this time, with the team warning that server return times may vary based on progress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside today’s patch notes, NetEase revealed what it is calling the Hero Hot List, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-hero-stats-reveal-pick-and-win-rates-in-quickplay-and-competitive-modes">stat page that details pick and win rates for heroes</a> across console and PC quickplay and competitive matches. It’s a list that will almost certainly change with Season 1 not only because of the balance adjustments but the introduction of four new heroes with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fantastic-four-confirmed-for-marvel-rivals-in-official-first-look-image">Fantastic Four</a>.
