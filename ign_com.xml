            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Animal Crossing: New Horizons got a big 3.0 update earlier this month, which alongside a lot of new content for everyone included a Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade with some fancy technological buffs. One of those was the ability to play with up to 12 total people on the same island, up from eight in the original version.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sounds fun, right? Wrong. It's a nightmare. A nightmare once again spawned by Nintendo handling online functionality in the most ridiculous way possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was so foolish and naive a week ago, when I first had the idea to get 12 of us together for an Animal Crossing session. It would be easy, I thought! So easy, I originally didn't even plan on writing anything about it! Let me just call up...11 other people I know who are still playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who also have Nintendo Switch 2s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And somehow we'll manage to find an hour we can all do this, despite everyone being busy adults.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, harder than I thought, but we did it! Last night, a group of 12 of us all logged on at once with a plan to meet up on my island. We considered using the Game Chat functionality, but decided against it due to lack of compatibility with Bluetooth headsets, the function's friending requirements, and the fact that you can't take screenshots while Game Chat is active. Discord it was, then, apparently still the second-best place for Nintendo Voice Chat (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/nintendo-voice-chat">after the podcast, of course</a>).</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092311-01kfk4k4x1qaac3z7dje12vshc-1769104423045.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The plan was for an hour-long session from 9pm to 10pm last night, but I recalled that the cutscene for people landing on the island was a bit lengthy, and we'd have to watch it 11 times, so I logged on half an hour early to open my island so we could start filtering in. I was hopeful that with improved Nintendo Switch 2 loading times, it might not be so bad. And it's true, the actual loading times were notably faster, though most of the wait for people to land is a combination of said cutscene ("We'll be making a water landing, but that's OK because this is a seaplane.") and everyone saving the game each time, so we didn't really shorten the wait by that much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But all that was to be expected. Here was where the nightmare began.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At 8:35pm, my friends began trickling in. We managed to get three people in before the entire session crashed, booting out everyone who had showed up so far and shutting my islands gates for me. I reopened at 8:46pm and we started again, this time creating a "queue" in our Discord text chat so everyone didn't try to flood in at once. At 8:58pm, one of my friends got an error that kicked her out alongside one other person, but everyone else stayed, so we brought them back and continued down the line.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092308-01kfk4hw7zj58ec37nepwcgtp8-1769104446457.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">At 9:19pm, I typed in Discord, "WE DID IT" as person #12 seemingly landed successfully.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At 9:21pm, as person #12 strolled in, another error occurred and two other people got kicked out. At this point, my husband (who was playing Ace Attorney next to me) started rolling his eyes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At 9:24pm, one of the people who had been kicked out tried to rejoin, errored out, and the whole session crashed again. Every single person got booted back to their islands and my gates were closed again, just as we were finally about to taste success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Please enjoy this timelapse video, courtesy of our intrepid Wiki writer KBABZ, of 40 minutes of us trying desperately to get everyone onto the island, only for the unthinkable to happen right at the very end:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I was undaunted. By golly, we got all these people together, we were going to hit each other with nets and drop recipe cards for each other! We started again from the top. This time I forbade everyone from doing anything once they landed aside from standing still in a line next to the airport. No menuing. No talking to villagers. Nothing. Folks started coming back in at 9:27pm. At 9:37pm, the fourth person to join crashed the island again. At 9:39pm, almost 40 minutes after our planned start time, we began yet again. Everyone posted cat pics in the Discord channel for emotional support.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092312-01kfk4kh4kd89e5tn3ez40q8zk-1769104468431.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This time worked. Finally, at 10:05pm, after multiple crashes and false starts, we had 12 people on my Animal Crossing island.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092315-01kfk4mbwv3js65mw1jeptph91-1769104494893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm happy to report that after the <em>90 minute ordeal</em> that was getting 12 people onto one island, online play actually worked great. We all exchanged gifts, took a pic in the Town Square, explored the island, and got coffee at Brewster's. People wrote on my bulletin board and sent me letters. Some borrowed my Wario costume from the hotel. A couple people decided to play pranks, burying junk and trapping my villagers with holes. It was genuinely a pretty great time. It just, you know, took way too dang long to set up.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092320-01kfk4pdtcz6we4gfvt9j2an9t-1769104494893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It's baffling to me that Nintendo's infrastructure for Animal Crossing is still set up this way. Yes, the island landing cutscene is very cute, and I do think the sea plane line is pretty funny. But why on earth do we need to sit through it 11 times, with everyone who's not traveling collectively watching a mostly-blank airport-themed loading screen? Why does everything on my island need to completely freeze and exit menus so someone can come in? Why does Group Stretching require me to be Best Friends with everyone on my island? How much worse would all this have been if we had used Game Chat? Mario Kart World doesn't have this problem!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092323-01kfk4q36ntgqn62xk8tmvvetf-1769104494893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The best explanation I can think of is that Nintendo genuinely didn't intend for anyone to use this feature in the first place. Animal Crossing: New Horizons' 3.0 update is fun, sure, but it's not creating the same massive surge in interest that existed in 2020 when we were all locked at home and had nothing better to do than ponder whatever it is that Dodos do. You're unlikely to ever need to collect 11 friends and drag them to your island all at once. Heck, given how hard this was to schedule, I'll be lucky to get four one of these weekends.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092325-01kfk4qm2h3qkextzwa2w2j5v7-1769104494893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is still very fun to play with friends, but it's still a massive pain in the butt to actually set up the circumstances for that play to be possible. Next time I'll just get everyone together for Jackbox.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092326-01kfk4qyknppc2dj0vk9fw215x-1769104546250.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We're still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-big-30-update-just-dropped-a-day-early">checking out the big 3.0 update</a> and all the fun new stuff that's been added.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Game Freak's upcoming action game Beast of Reincarnation reemerged at the Xbox Developer Direct, with a lengthy segment showing off traversal, combat, its cast of characters, some dang good music, and more. Also, great news, it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-gets-new-look-at-actionrpg-hybrid-combat-and-a-summer-release-window">apparently out this summer</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beast of Reincarnation is a fascinating new game, and an anomaly in Game Freak's portfolio. Game Freak is, of course, best-known for developing Pokemon, a series that's grown in scope as it's transitioned to home console releases but has also seen notable declines in performance and visual quality. But Game Freak has also been increasing its other independent endeavors in recent years, with games such as HarmoKnight, Tembo the Badass Elephant, and Pocket Card Jockey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But aside from Pokemon all of those have been fairly small-scale endeavors. Though we haven't gotten our hands on Beast of Reincarnation yet, this <em>looks</em> far more ambitious. It's a full-on action game, for one, with what seems to be pretty complex and multi-layered combat and movement. It's also, if the trailers are any indication, really pretty, and a departure from Game Freak's historically more cartoony style. That's led to plenty of questions as to what led Game Freak to make something like this in the first place, and whether or not the studio can pull it off. At least from what we saw today, there's reason for optimism.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I sat down with Kota Furushima, game director of Beast of Reincarnation, to chat about some of these topics, as well as get some further details on what exactly the game will be. Here's our full interview transcript, very lightly edited for clarity:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Beast of Reincarnation seems very, very different from anything Game Freak has done before. How did this game come to be?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kota Furushima: </strong>So, it all started, I wanted to get something going. It was an original project. I wanted to try something completely different and new, unlike other stuff we've made. And it just so happened that internally, here at Game Freak, we have a program we call the Gear Project, which is sort of an internal contest run by our president, Satoshi Tajiri, to make original IP within the company. So, I entered my design doc into that contest, and I was able to get permission to start working on a project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I should mention too, to clarify, it wasn't so much that I was trying to do something different than what we've done before. I started with the concept of the feeling that I wanted to get across to the users, the feeling of loneliness, isolation, and warmth, and the game design that we have now kind of coalesced naturally around that concept.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How long ago was it that you entered this in the contest?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>It was about six years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Beast of Reincarnation does seem to be a significantly larger game than some of the other, I guess, non-Pokemon projects you've worked on before. Did the studio have to scale up significantly for Beast of Reincarnation?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>The team is quite large, as you can imagine, but I will note that it's not all folks internally here at Game Freak. We managed to seek out a lot of partner companies to work with us, companies, studios that are able to realize the vision of this game in the way that we wanted to make it, so we're lucky to have a lot of people working on it externally as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">[<em>PR reached out post-interview to clarify that the internal Game Freak team working on Beast of Reincarnation is "relatively small" while still playing a core role in leading the project through direction and management.</em>] </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Can you tell me about the original pitch that you entered into the contest, like what that original sort of design looked like?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>So, it was pretty simple at first. The general concept was the idea of taking a journey along with a companion. That was the main pillar of the game, and you started thinking about the feelings you wanted the player to have, and gradually, the design sort of began to coalesce around that idea of the journey with the companion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Was there anything in particular that inspired you throughout the development of the game, other games, film, art, music, just any other art in particular that you were thinking of, as you worked on Beast of Reincarnation?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>Yeah, absolutely. I mentioned I'm a big fan of science fiction movies to start with, and because I wanted to create this new world that no one had seen before, I started really putting a lot of thought into the way world building is done and science fiction. Blade Runner was a specific one that I can mention, that does such a good job of world building. I wanted to try and create my own world in a similar sort of fashion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So, Beast of Reincarnation, I know, was originally announced under the Private Division label when it was part of Take-Two, and then Private Division got acquired, renamed, and is now being run by different people. I'm curious if all those changes impacted the development of Beast of Reincarnation in any way.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima:</strong> There's probably not much I can say about that, to be honest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Okay, tell me a bit about the structure of Beast of Reincarnation. Is it a linear, story focused game? Is it open world, Metroidvania, something else?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>The way we created this game, it is about a journey with a beginning, middle, and end, right? It kind of conjures up images of a road movie sort of thing, so it's not open world in the purest sense. The game is comprised of different stages, but these stages I would not describe as linear either. There's quite a lot of room for exploration, a lot of radiation between the different environments and things of that nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What are you primarily doing in these different stages? Are you primarily fighting creatures? Are you doing more exploration? Are there puzzles? What are the main activities that you're doing as the character?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima:</strong> You're doing a lot of different things in the game. I think there are no traditional puzzles to put block progress, for instance, as you saw them, but there are definitely puzzle adjacent segments of the game. For example, this game takes place in a world that's been largely destroyed, so you could come to a part where you want to get across a chasm, and the bridge has been destroyed, so you have to start thinking, "How can I get across there?" Now, luckily, Emma, the main character, has a lot of abilities at her disposal. She can extend at the vine or plant, I don't know what you call it, her hair actually. I mean, she can use that, for example, to cross a chasm instead of a bridge, right? So she has certain abilities at her disposal that can help her get through this world. Of course, battle is a huge part of the game, as well as exploration. There's definitely parts where you want to see what's off the beaten path as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How challenging is the combat?  I'm curious if there's difficulty settings or if a casual player could pick it up and feel comfortable with counters and things like that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>First of all, I should say that, yes, there are three difficulty settings in the game. As many people to play it as possible, there's going to be story mode. There's a little bit easier, there's normal mode, and then of course there's hard move where enemies are significantly stronger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even in the normal mode, it's important to note that the game is not just played through the single character of Emma. She, of course, has her companion Koo. Koo also has actions that he can use in conjunction with Emma. There's a lot of freedom and variety of what you can do in the game. Beast of Reincarnation is, of course, an action RPG. Players have the freedom to think of their own strategy and the way they're going to tap all certain situations, how to best utilize Emma's abilities and Koo's abilities to suit their own play-style with which they're most comfortable.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Beast of Reincarnation Official Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Can you give me an example of a type of play style you're referring to? Are we thinking the difference between close range and long range? Is it more magical or physical? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>There's a lot of variety in the game. As far as the main actions of the player that Emma is going to undertake for attacks, she largely relies on her Katana for close range attacks. She also has the ability to attack a long range with bows, crossbows, and those sorts of weapons. Koo, of course, relies primarily on what we call bloom arts, which are kind of plant-based attacks in the game. You'll find yourself up against some pretty big enemies, and the rhythm of a lot of the combat does center around pairing, countering, and things of that nature, but you also, again, have an added layer of using Koo and his abilities to your advantage as well, so there's quite a lot of variety there that different people can use in different ways to suit their own style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What can you tell me about Emma and Koo as characters? Who are they? How would you describe them?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>One thing to note is, at the beginning of the game, Emma is kind of a blank slate. She has neither memories nor emotions or feelings when you first meet her. Koo, you'll soon discover, is what are known in this world as malefacts. He has this blight, or this corruption about him. You will notice in the game, too, that Emma herself is also a blighted one, and although this does give her special abilities, the downside of that is, of course, she's not treated well by other humans. She's living a very isolated lifestyle, essentially banished. What we have here, typically in this world, Emma would consider a creature like Koo to be an enemy because he is blighted. She typically fights against these sorts of enemies, so there's a bit of irony in this game, that she ends up teaming up with Koo and they go on this journey together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What can you tell me about the music in Beast of Reincarnation? I really enjoyed the music that I heard in the trailer, and I was curious who was composing it and what the vision and style was.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>So, starting with the concepts of the score, again, the music is very much focused on the game's core concepts themselves, out of loneliness and isolation and learning to rely on people, that sort of motif and sort of feeling. So there's all sorts of different types of songs in the game. There's some focus on amplifying the trusting relationship that Emma develops with Koo. Some focus on the loneliness and despair of the world itself that's been destroyed. Then, we have the bosses in the game, which are called Nushi. Their music tracks tend to focus on more kind of traditional, Japanese sort of instrumentation. They give it a difference as well, so there's a lot of variety in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I know Game Freak has a lot of history of delving into mythology and nature, especially with all the Pokemon designs they've done over the years to create really interesting creatures, and I'm curious if we'll see any particular myths, legends, or types of creatures in the world of Beast of Reincarnation.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>I think what you'll see in the game is a lot of the natural environments, whether it be the plant life, the flora, and the fauna in this game, the animals and the plants are very much based on the plant life and animal life that we see here in Japan and we've seen here in Japan throughout our history. Sakura, cherry blossoms would be a good example of that. It definitely has a sort of a local feel, in terms of the creatures that you'll meet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Game Freak has received some criticism in the past few years for the performance and look of some of its 3D open world games. Beast of Reincarnation looks to be fairly ambitious. What would you say to those who are concerned that it might struggle in the same ways?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>I think when it comes to Beast of Reincarnation, and I guess we would regard it as the scale and the ambition of the title, when we approach game design, we're not looking to make, say, a title of a certain level of quality. We're looking to deliver a very specific game experience, and visual fidelity and graphics, this is something that supports that game experience, everything that goes into that. That includes things like bug fixing, optimization. Everything is there to serve the gameplay and the experience. Our focus is on that gameplay experience. Part of that, of course, is making sure that it performs really well, but our attention is more on getting the experience over to you and making sure that our vision can get to your hands and your hearts.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/beast-of-reincarnation-heroart-1769108376624.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Beast of Reincarnation official artwork.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What can you tell me about the, I guess they're called the Nushi, the bosses. In the presentation I saw they create these blighted forests, and that the environment will change. Can you tell me a little more about that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>The Nushi, as you said, they're kind of bosses in the game, but sitting above the Nushi is the ultimate presence in the game, the Beast of Reincarnation itself, which the game is named after, Emma and Koo essentially start their journey to defeat the Beast of Reincarnation, but in order to do that, they face off against Nushi on the way there as a way to sort of weaken the Beast of Reincarnation and make it a boss they can actually take on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, as you defeat these Nushi, you get new abilities from them, and you continue on your journey to ultimately face off against the Beast of Reincarnation. You touched on the blighted forest as well. So the Nushi, Beast of Reincarnation, again, is the reason that the world is kind of in this fall and corroded and blighted state. The Nushi themselves create these blighted forests around them, as you noted. The environment actually changes. From there, from those forests, the enemies in the game, the biological enemies, the Malefacts, are also kind of part and parcel with what it is that the Nushis are bringing into the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Does that imply that something we'll be doing is going back and revisiting areas we've been before, when the blighted forest is there or not there?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>There's a couple of parts to that question there. So, one thing to note, simply defeating a Nushi is not really enough to change the environment in a really meaningful way. Ultimately, the Beast of Reincarnation has kind of a grasp on all of the land and has kind of turned it this way, so you're not able to make huge changes to the environment by defeating Nushi, but you can absolutely go back to places you've been, and you're oftentimes going to want to explore and find hidden areas and items and things of that nature. There's plenty of secrets to discover in places that essentially you've already been through, you're able to freely go back and keep exploring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is that because she has these plant hair abilities. I assume she's getting more of these, as you progress, that are going to unlock more things. Is that right?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>Actually, there's not a lot of that sort of exploration in the game. You're basically able to get where you need to go with your default abilities. The real question is how. You can see a place you want to go, but do you know how to get there yet? I think, as the player gets more and more accustomed to using these abilities, you'll start to get inspired and understand you're leveling up, I guess, as a player, rather than the character getting abilities that will unlock kind of locations and places. It's more about coming to terms with, getting a grip on, and getting better at using those abilities yourself as a player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You guys have a really long, historical relationship with Nintendo. Is there any chance we'll see this game come to Nintendo Switch 2 eventually?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>There's nothing to announce right now about other platforms that have not already been announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I have one more question.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fable, the upcoming open-world fantasy RPG from Playground Games, has 1,000 fully voiced NPCs, and, if you do the right things, you can marry every single one of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The long-awaited fairytale follow-up to Lionhead’s original Xbox trilogy was showcased at the January 2026 Xbox Developer Direct, and finally gave us a good look at its gameplay. But, there’s more to learn yet, as IGN spoke to the founder of Playground Games, the studio crafting the Fable reboot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When speaking about the characters that inhabit the world of this new version of Fable, Playground chief Ralph Fulton told us: “They are handcrafted, and there are a lot of things about the way we have built the living population, which I think you could be forgiven for saying is just nuts. I think we maybe once thought we could procedurally generate them, but we abandoned that idea quite a long time ago because we wanted to craft every one of these NPCs from their name, to their appearance, to their personality traits, to that moral worldview that I talked about, to where they work and where they live and what their family unit is because it's important to the player that they can get to know unique crafted NPCs.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fable Screenshots - Xbox Developer Direct 2026</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“There's 1,000 of them in the game”, Fulton continued. “You can go and speak to every single one of them in fully voiced conversations. You could marry, it'll be a bit of work, but you could marry them all. You can have kids with them, you can hire them, you can fire them, they are just great fun. And also they act as this sort of Greek chorus, if you like, reflecting your choices and your morality back at you. So, as you walk around, that's classic Fable, isn't it? People catcalling you in the street, telling you what they think of you. It's a brilliant thing in our game as well, but it's a great way of tracking how popular your decisions have been, your choices have been.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn’t sound like it will be easy to just pop the question to anyone you see wandering around Albion, then, with the way you’ve chosen to role-play as your hero dictating who may react positively to an offer of engagement. What if you’re playing as a goody two-shoes knight of the realm, but then a local necromancer catches your eye and captures your heart shortly after? Will you be tempted to delve into the dark arts in the name of love? Search deep within yourself; only you have the answer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fable is a series that lived and died by its morality system, so it's great to see an emphasis on this sort of character building returning to the reboot. But, Playground doesn’t simply want to revive the same type of obvious ‘good vs evil’ decisions seen in the Lionhead games, instead opting for a more fluid approach to how you work your way through its story’s many choices, and, in turn, how its world reacts to your decisions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We talk about how our morality system is more about shades of gray,” Fulton revealed. “It's more about the subjectivity of morality that, honestly, we see in the world today. There's no objective good, there's no objective evil. You couldn't get everyone in the world to agree that something is evil or that something is good. That just doesn't happen. That diversity of opinion, I think, is really clear these days. And therefore we've sort of taken that and probably in quite a gamey system-y way, we've taken that and built it into this reputation system that we talk about in the piece, which allows you to build reputations based on the things you do within Albion.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You could do big things once or little things lots of times”, Fulton explained. “And if people see you doing that, it contributes to you building a reputation in that particular location. But then the key thing is how the people of Albion react to that, and they react to it based on the individual, almost unique worldview that they each have. And I think that's probably a more nuanced view of morality, but it's super interesting, and it's also just packed with potential in gameplay terms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground">IGN's interview with Playground studio head and Fable director Ralph Fulton</a> in full.

And I think as a game developer, the most important thing to me is that the greatest number of people play my games as possible. That's what we're in this for. I think that's true of most developers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Xbox Developer Direct, Pokemon developer Game Freak arrived on the scene to give a lengthy new look at its new game, Beast of Reincarnation, alongside a narrowed release window: it's planned for release in summer of this year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beast of Reincarnation takes place in a post-apocalyptic, future Japan in the year 4026. It's giving off big Nier: Automata vibes, with modern world ruins covered in overgrowth and plants, and the contrast of mutated natural creatures and machines. You play as Emma, a young woman who's been corrupted by the "blight", aka the force that's caused the destruction of most of the world. Emma is capable of sealing the blight within her own body, a gift that allows her to purify corrupted creatures but also makes her a societal outcast. She meets Koo, a wolf creature similarly plagued by blight, and through an unlikely set of circumstances the pair end up on a journey together to defeat the legendary Beast of Reincarnation, the monster at the heart of the blight plague.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beast of Reincarnation is primarily an action game where you control Emma, who can fight close-range with a katana or long-range with a bow and arrow against corrupted enemies called Malefacts and even more powerful boss monsters, known as Nushi. However, she's also accompanied by a Malefact named Koo, who fights alongside her. Koo has special abilities that, when activated, will slow down time and allow access to something more like a turn-based RPG menu, where the player can pick the move they want to use next before moving on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer also gave us a look at other elements of Beast of Reincarnation, such as skill trees for both Emma and Koo, a faction of mechanical golems that used to house human souls, and three other supporting characters: Brad, Kagura, and Kunai.

The game's PlayStation 5 version is expected to arrive at a later date — though we still don't know when exactly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As announced last year, Forza Horizon 6 will be set in Japan — a location that has long been on the wishlist of many Forza fans. Amusingly, the setting was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-location-leaked-by-car-import-company-fans-believe">spoiled ahead of time by a real-life car import company</a> connected to the game — which, if nothing else, showed that the development crew at Playground Games had been busy doing its homework.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay shown today revealed that you'll initially play as a rookie racer who's just a tourist in Japan. You'll also be joined by two close friends, passionate motorsports enthusiast Jordy and experienced Japanese car builder Mei, who'll give you an insider’s perspective on your journey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pick up wristbands and rise up the ranks, and you'll soon be on your way around Japan — from its breathtaking rural mountains to the heart of Tokyo. 550 cars will be available in-game at launch — the most for any new Forza Horizon game — including the game's cover cars, the 2025 GR GT Prototype and the 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A major new addition is the Estate — a large plot of land in the mountains you can build up from scratch, placing buildings, roads, and invite your friends in for a tour. The end of today's showing revealed the briefest tease of a hulking Gundam — though that was all we got to see for now.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/img-8489-1769106006893.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Forza x Gundam?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Playground Games art director Don Arceta and cultural consultant Kyoko Yamashita <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-heads-to-japan-this-is-the-time-we-can-actually-do-it-justice">spoke with IGN last year</a> to discuss the decision to finally send the series to Japan, and how Forza Horizon 6's Tokyo City will probably be the "most complex and intricate space of drivable area in a Horizon game yet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's Xbox Developer Direct also includes fresh details on Fable, the fantasy reboot also being made by Forza Horizon developer Playground Games.
