            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/goddess-of-victory-nikke-is-celebrating-its-second-anniversary<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">There's a new story event and lots of free recruitment opportunities.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The free-to-play sci-fi shooter Goddess of Victory: Nikke is coming up on its second anniversary, and it’s marking the occasion by giving players lots of goodies. There are new characters, new story content, a new minigame, free recruitment opportunities, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not familiar with Goddess of Victory: Nikke, it’s a third-person idle shooter from developer Shift Up that’s available for free on iOS, Android, and PC. You lead a squad of android soldiers called Nikke, the last hope for reclaiming the overworld from a vicious race of aliens called Raptures who have forced humanity underground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game has been going strong, with more than 45 million downloads worldwide in the two years since release. To celebrate that success and give back to fans, Shift Up launched an extensive anniversary event that is ongoing now. The festivities started on October 26 with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vO9vY4nE3A" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a livestream</a> that included lots of rewards, both in game and out.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-1-1729706806095.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a new story event called Old Tales, which will let players see earlier events through the eyes of Cinderella. She previously was an enemy who players defeated during the first anniversary event Red Ash, but now you’ll get to see things from her perspective and learn more about her.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cinderella, Grave, and Rapunzel: Pure Grace will be three new characters added as part of the anniversary celebration. All three are SSR Nikke, the highest rarity of Nikke in the game. There will be lots of free recruitment opportunities that accompany them as well, making this an ideal time for newcomers to dive in.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-2-1729706806096.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you log in during the anniversary event, you can claim up to 15 Advanced Recruit Vouchers and a SSR Nikke choice box, which will let you choose between two characters to recruit for free — either Snow White: Innocent Days or the new character Rapunzel: Pure Grace. The Cinderella Pick Up Recruitment event will give you one free recruit every day until November 21, while the Grave Pick Up Recruitment event will also give you a free recruit every day from November 7 to November 28.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-3-1729706806096.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you complete the Old Tales event, you’ll get several rewards: 15 Advanced Recruit Vouchers, 15 Ordinary Recruit Vouchers, and 2 SSR Nikke choice boxes. The rewards for all of these events stack, so if you take part in all of the anniversary events on offer, you can get multiple guaranteed free characters and dozens of free recruitment opportunities. So new players can get a nice jumpstart to begin their journey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all. Since its inception, Goddess of Victory: Nikke has routinely added new minigames that spice up gameplay. It added a tower defense minigame during the 1.5 anniversary and a Dave the Diver collab minigame during this year’s summer event. That tradition continues with the second anniversary, which introduces In the Mirror, an action-platforming minigame focused on platform jumping.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-4-1729706806096.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Goddess of Victory: Nikke is also taking the celebration out into the real world. It has partnered with Bushiroad to create a Nikke trading card game that will now be published worldwide for the first time. And in the United States and Canada, it’s collaborating with milk tea brands Xing Fu Tang and The Alley to launch Nikke-branded bubble tea and hold in-store pop-up events.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-5-1729706806096.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">That will include a special drink centered on Cinderella, and select stores will have exclusive rewards and cosplayer events. In Canada, Nikke’s partnership with The Alley will run from October 28 to November 10. Their pop-up event will be in Toronto on November 9 at Scarborough Town Centre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the U.S., Nikke’s partnership with Xing Fu Tang will run from November 13 to December 15. The pop-up events will be held in New York on November 16 at Korean Town Store, in Houston on November 17 at Bellaire Blvd., and in Los Angeles on November 23 at Alhambra.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/24/bubble-tea-collab-1729792728728.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can download Goddess of Victory: Nikke for free now on , on the App Store, or Google Play.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-has-recouped-most-of-the-development-and-marketing-expenses-for-alan-wake-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">And Annapurna Pictures is financing 50% of the cost of Control 2.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Alan Wake 2 continues to be a success for Remedy, with the company reporting today it has recouped "most" of the development and marketing cost of Alan Wake 2 as of the end of September.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its quarterly earnings today, Remedy reported that while the game is not yet generating royalties, it's close to fully recouping costs thanks to continued strong sales. The studio has released two expansions for Alan Wake 2 this year that have likely helped - <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-2-night-springs-expansion-announced-releasing-tomorrow-sgf-2024">Night Springs</a> and, more recently, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/alan-wake-ii-lake-house-expansion-reveal-trailer-state-of-play-2024">The Lake House</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alan Wake 2 shifting to generating royalties seems inevitable, and will likely be a big deal for Remedy. It's the company's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-2-remedys-fastest-selling-game-so-far">fastest-selling game so far</a>, selling 1.3 million copies as of March 20 this year. Currently, the company's only major sources of ongoing revenue are sales of Control and older Alan Wake games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, it's getting infusions of cash from partner companies for the purpose of developing more games. For instance, Annapurna Pictures <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-movies-on-the-way-thanks-to-new-annapurna-partnership">recently entered into a partnership</a> with the studio that will fund 50% of the development of Control 2, while Annapurna creates film and TV spin-offs of Control and Alan Wake. Remedy reports that Control 2 development is on track to start full production in 2025, with a number of critical features already implemented.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Remedy's other games in progress, Codename Condor, Remedy's multiplayer Control spin-off, was announced recently as FBC: Firebreak. Remedy reports that Firebreak is still in full production, and focused on iterating on the core loop and implementing UI for player clarity based on playtesting feedback. Meanwhile, Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remake is making "steady progress" in full production.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Alan Wake 2: Night Springs DLC Reveal Trailer Screenshots - Summer Game Fest 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For the quarter, Remedy reported revenue up 128.6% year-over-year to €17.9 million ($19.4 million), largely due to the one-time payment from Annapurna Pictures to develop Control, as well as other development fees taken from other sources.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alan Wake 2 itself seems excellent, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-review">netting a 9/10 from our reviewer</a> who called it "a superb survival horror sequel that makes the cult-classic original seem like little more than a rough first draft by comparison." Its most recent DLC, The Lake House, is also excellent, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-2-dlc-has-what-looks-like-a-pretty-big-teaser-for-control-2">appears to be teasing Control 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
