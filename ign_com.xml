            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jurassic-world-evolution-3-lets-you-channel-your-inner-john-hammond.1213602/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-lets-you-channel-your-inner-john-hammond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I never stopped thinking about wanting to repeat all of John Hammond's mistakes since the first time I saw him make them in 1993's Jurassic Park. And I've had many opportunities to do so in various park-builder games in the decades since, ranging all the way from pretty disappointing to pretty great. The latest, Jurassic World Evolution 3, is looking to deliver more features than we've ever seen in a dinosaur park management game before. And at least for my part, you had me at [insert signature T-Rex roar in your mind's eye here].</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing that's always bugged me about the previous Jurassic World Evolution games is that they seemed a bit stripped-down compared to what Frontier has shown us is possible with their sister franchises, Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster. So the thing I'm most excited about with Evolution 3 is that it seems like we're finally getting the full Frontier feature set in a Jurassic game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can build your own hotels, gift shops, and staff buildings by snapping together tons of resizable and re-colorable props. You can reshape the terrain at will, make your own functional waterfalls, and even create dinosaur enclosures that use natural rock formations instead of electric fences as part of the perimeter. The devs want everything you build to feel like it still belongs in the Jurassic franchise, so the props and such are a bit more grounded-looking than what you might see in Planet Coaster 2. But for the first time, it doesn't feel like they're compromising at all on the sandbox elements that make their other games great for the sake of being a licensed game.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>LIFE FINDS A WAY</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The other major addition here is the inclusion of dinosaur breeding and baby dinosaurs for the first time. While the previous games in the series relied on artificial fertilization and incubation of eggs, Evolution 3 will actually allow you to clone fertile dinosaurs, place dinosaur nests, and even selectively crossbreed for specific skins, stats, and personality traits. And this, of course, comes with the addition of juvenile models for all of the more than 80 species included in the base game. On top of this, adult males and females will now exhibit varying levels of sexual dimorphism, like male triceratops having larger frills, meaning there will be more than 240 distinct dino and prehistoric reptile models in total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This will introduce new challenges to manage within your enclosures, too. For instance, Frontier told us a male T-rex will not have any interest in coexisting with other adult males, though large groups of females can put up with each other. This will vary somewhat from species to species, as they have different social dynamics with each other and with other species. It even matters for breeding, since some species will only nest if they're out of view of pesky humans and don't have any other species around.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A male T-rex will not have any interest in coexisting with other adult males, though large groups of females can put up with each other.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Evolution 3 will also be taking us to a variety of different worldwide locations that are new to the series, including the mountains of Japan and the Mediterranean island of Malta. They not only feature their own distinct plant life and terrain, but also building sets and props that can add a little bit of global flair to your park. The ones we saw included an East Asian-themed set, an Alpine European-themed set, a set based on the original Jurassic Park films with a kitschy jungle aesthetic, and one based on the newer Jurassic World films that looks more modern and shiny.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we won't be fighting with the climate in different biomes the same way as in Planet Zoo, each one will feature different clients in the campaign mode that want you to focus on different objectives. Some might be interested in simply selling as many tickets and luxury hotel rooms as possible, while others lean more into conservation and science.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>CHANGING WORLD</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">All the while we'll be working with the Dinosaur Integration Network, or DIN. To be honest, the newer films are mostly just a big mushy blob in my head, but I think the idea is that dinosaurs just live in the wild now and we're trying to learn how to coexist with them instead of putting them back in cages. It's whatever. The originals are still the ones that matter to me, and it sounds like we'll be fully able to build a dinosaur theme park in the spirit of the original films.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there also seems to be something sinister going on with a secretive group who doesn't like DIN and might cause trouble at your park, based on an ominous moment in the trailer. And that could be interesting, too. In previous games, tropical storms and equipment malfunctions could lead to dinosaurs breaking out and running rampant. But the first book and film were about a human saboteur causing a massive disaster, so that feels in the spirit of the franchise for me as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are worried about your dinos going for a stroll and choosing to have the kind of snack that's going to require you to pay out millions to their family, there are some new tools for that as well. You won't be warned automatically, for instance, if a fence is in poor shape or being attacked by a hangry carnotaurus. For that, you'll need security cameras with full coverage along the length of the fence, allowing you to be notified as soon as there's a problem. And if the cameras go down, well, I hope you have good lawyers.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>OPEN FOR BUSINESS</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the day, you don't have to work particularly hard to get me excited about a new dinosaur park management game. Especially one with the in-depth customization tools Frontier has become known for. Watching a baby triceratops play in the grass is adorable. I don't care who you are. And the breeding mechanics open up a lot of long-term possibilities for making not just the parks I want, but the kinds of dinosaurs I want, too. As a paleontology nerd who's a bit bummed the designs in the Jurassic franchise are a bit stuck in the 90s, I asked if I could breed my raptors to have feathers, but the devs were a bit tight-lipped about that. I guess we can hope.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jurassic World Evolution 3 will be coming to Playstation 5, Xbox, and PC on October 21.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-director-ninja-turtle-ign-live-2025</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-director-ninja-turtle-ign-live-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After the success of the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 remake, more classic games in the beloved franchise are set to get revamped with the impending release of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4. At IGN Live, the game’s director, Kurt Tillmanns, was on hand to talk about what this collection has to offer in terms of mixing new and old elements - including one bright green new inclusion in the form of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle's resident party dude, Michaelangelo. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Said Tillmans, about including such an offbeat and notable new skater on the roster, “It was awesome working with Nickelodeon on getting Mikey in here. We were super passionate. Everyone who gets an opportunity to be part of a Tony Hawk game is just incredibly gracious and excited to be a part of it. They're wonderful collaborators. You know, we took great pride in building him for the game. He's also got three turtle-themed special tricks in the game that you can get when you unlock him, and you can equip those onto any other skater in the game. So, that's a ton of fun by itself!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When it came to adding a two-minute timer element to this version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, Tillmans remarked, “We’re rebuilding two of the best games of all time from the ground up. And we wanted this to be one game. It's got the concept from two awesome games, but it really is one game. So that means that Tony Hawk 3 is going to get some features and things that Tony Hawk 4 had and Tony Hawk 4, along with the classic goals that you remember, is going to be able to be played with a two-minute timer. That timer can actually be extended up to an hour for people who want to play more at their own pace. We've also got all of the classic game modes returning, so you can skate around in the four parks and free skate single session or speed run and continue to do things at your own pace in those modes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tillmans said he was excited by the online play aspect of the game because he felt, for Iron Galaxy, “That is the heritage of our studio. So, we are extremely excited to be bringing this game to seven platforms. We’ve got both PlayStations, both Xboxes, both Switches, and three PC stores. And not only that, we are going to feature cross-play across every single platform. So that's huge. This game is coming to the widest audience, to the widest player base that any Tony Hawk game has ever had."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked about developing the Switch 2 version of the game, Tillmans laughed, “I mean, honestly, what's one other platform when we’re already doing six, right? As soon as we knew that we were going to be in the window and it was going to be possible for us to be able to support it, we just jumped at the opportunity.” As for the performance of the game on the new console, he noted, “We're going to run at 60 FPS on Switch 2 on every park, so it's going to be amazing performance.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The soundtracks have always been a big part of the Tony Hawk games, and Tillmans said that for the remake of Pro Skater 3 + 4, “We have a ton of people who are just super passionate about the soundtrack. Obviously, when you start making a Tony Hawk game, that's one of the things that people are most excited about. We take it very seriously. Tony Hawk himself has a lot of opinions about the soundtrack and he probably knows more about the music that skaters are listening to than anyone else in the world, so we obviously hold his opinion in high esteem."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what it was like working with Hawk himself, Tillmans said, “He’s an awesome collaborator. He's great to work with. He takes this being kind of the lexicon for skating very seriously. He plays the game frequently and he will often tell us, ‘Hey, think this trick name is now called something else. Let me check with some people.’ And he will make sure that the trick list, which has been updated from 1 + 2, represents the language and the verbiage that skaters are using today."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Regarding the new skate parks the game includes, Tillmans said, “It’s a huge honor for us to be able to add, for the first time in over 10 years, three brand new parks into a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater game. The game is going to feature the water park, the movie studio, and the pinball park. And the pinball park is super exciting. It fits in with that kind of park, like Roswell or Area 51 and Skater Heaven, where only Tony Hawk games could really take the skater into these fantastical places..” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Tillmans explained, “When we come up with ideas for these parks, we think about the types of things that might be a forbidden place for a skater to go and skate, like a shut down water park that really fulfills that skater fantasy. And also those fantastic places, like a pinball park where the skater is actually like the size of a pinball in the machine skating around. The ball will ping pong around everywhere and wipe you out. And if you look up, there's actually a giant Tony Hawk playing the pinball machine that you're in. Then he'll react when you bail and cover his eyes. It's great."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, now that Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1-4 have gotten the remake treatment, should we expect the fifth game, Tony Hawk’s Underground, next? When asked that question, Tillmans remained mostly tightlipped, but he let it be known the interest is certainly there, replying “We’re focused on shipping [3 + 4]. I'm getting text messages right now from people working on the game. So we want to ship this game. We can't wait to get 3 + 4 out to the audience. Beyond that, we would absolutely love to keep working on this.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 - Before and After Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be released on July 11, 2025, and you can check <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-first-impressions-of-the-remake">our first impressions of the remake right here.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Remakes and remasters are very much an 'in' thing at the moment, and while it's no surprise that we would eventually see what are arguably two of the best entries in the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater series make their way to modern platforms, I definitely didn't expect this package to be as robust of a remake as it's shaping up to be," Our previewer, Nick Maillet said.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
