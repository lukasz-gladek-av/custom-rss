            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-look-even-better-on-ps5-pro-experts-give-their-verdict<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Did you watch the new GTA 6 trailer and think, ‘Wow, the bubbles inside that bottle of beer look really, <em>really</em> good?’ You’re not alone. Hundreds of millions of viewers have now watched the second Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer and marveled at the technical brilliance on display. And knowing that the trailer footage was all <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-some-said-gta-6-trailer-2-looked-too-good-to-have-been-captured-on-a-base-ps5-rockstar-confirms-it-really-was-and-theres-even-gameplay-in-there">captured on PS5</a> is just mind-blowing. But are we being set up to be fooled?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN spoke to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a>’s Alexander Battaglia to help break down what we saw and understand whether there are any takeaways we can glean from the newest GTA 6 trailer and how it might translate into actual gameplay experience on console. And it turns out, we can.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The trailer is running at 30 fps and is completely made up of — presumably — real-time cutscenes and not gameplay — hence the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen,” Battaglia says. “I imagine the game’s primary target for such cutscenes is 30 fps, and it’s likely the same for gameplay.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">30 fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X is nothing new. Games often come with either a fidelity mode, which prioritizes up to 4K resolution at 30 fps, or a performance mode, which targets 60 fps at lower resolution. But with the launch of the PS5 Pro, Sony has made efforts to bridge the two modes, and it’s something Battaglia says we’ll likely see pushed closer to the game’s release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Given the image quality in the trailer, which may well be a use of FSR1 (AMD’s AI performance enhancing tool and the basis of PS5 Pro’s PSSR) from a low internal resolution, PS5 Pro could enhance image quality through the use of PSSR making a less aliased, more detailed image with less blur.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally speaking, I tend to always opt for performance mode over fidelity mode, but one of the key selling points for PS5 Pro is that you don’t have to make that choice, you can have both. So while Digital Foundry thinks PS5 Pro can improve image quality, the big question is: Will GTA 6 run at 60 fps on console?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zVIy_La7nk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry tech breakdown</u></a> posted on YouTube, the panel seems to agree that GTA 6 will not be able to hit 60 fps on console. “As soon as you have RTGI [Ray Traced Global Illumination], a massive open world, those things tend not to run well at 60 fps… I think everything points to this being a 30 fps game, maybe with a 40 fps mode on some [consoles].”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The trailer uses ray tracing extensively, which could be further enhanced on PS5 Pro</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At the heart of the matter is ray tracing, which Digital Foundry says seems integral to GTA 6, not just from a tech perspective but an artistic one. “You can’t get rid of RTGI. It’s inherent to the way the game works. And they’re throughout the trailer, so they obviously made them a part of the gameplay.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leonida, Rockstar’s version of the Sunshine State, is full of light. Whether it’s from the sun itself beaming on bright beaches and suntanned bodies, or the neon lights illuminating Vice City’s nightlife, ray tracing feels core to GTA 6’s art direction, and also why it likely won’t run higher than 30 fps. It could also be where PS5 Pro players find the most joy over their PS5 and Xbox Series X counterparts: “The trailer uses ray tracing extensively, which could be further enhanced on PS5 Pro,” Battaglia says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the ray tracing improvements on PS5 Pro are speculative, you only have to compare the new GTA 6 trailer with the first one to see that Rockstar is hammering the importance of RTGI to the look of GTA 6. “Real-time ray-traced transparency reflections are much more obvious in this trailer, so glass on beer bottles, cars’ windscreens, building windows, and more look particularly good.” The bubbly beer that hundreds of millions of GTA fans are obsessing over is why GTA 6 might not run at 60 fps, but also why GTA 6 might look even better on PS5 Pro. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While 30 fps seems to be the default across consoles, PS5 Pro’s better ray tracing capabilities mean this key GTA 6 feature should get a better showcase on Sony’s more powerful console. To date, the improvements PS5 Pro offers over the base console varies wildly from one game to the next, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxzpAluabec" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Assassin’s Creed Shadows currently the best showcase</u></a> for what the console can do. But I’m hoping Rockstar and GTA 6 take it a step further and make the difference even more noticeable.</p><div id="every-rockstar-game-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3><h3>Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At the opposite end of the powerhouse scale is the Xbox Series S, which is currently the weakest console that can play GTA 6 (there’s no word yet on whether Rockstar will bring GTA 6 to Switch 2). Digital Foundry says that to get GTA 6 on the Series S, Rockstar may need to sacrifice ray tracing completely to run the game at 30 fps, with sub-1080p resolution. But the Series S still has the same ballpark CPU power and storage as Series X, so it’s not impossible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s still a whole year until GTA 6 hits shelves (sadly), and with only two trailers released so far, there are still a lot of unknown variables. But even the changes from the first GTA 6 trailer to the newest one reveals loads of interesting technical details, from a constant 30 fps captured on PS5 to the improved ray tracing. And with history telling us that Rockstar typically only releases 30 fps GTA games, all signs are pointing to the same for GTA 6 – although if the trailers are anything to go by, the series has never looked better. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Once the work is done, DuPz0r will release an updated map, which fans hope will give them their best look yet at what to expect from GTA 6 when it eventually comes out in May 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, if before then, Rockstar releases more GTA 6 assets, when fans get their first proper look at gameplay perhaps, the volunteers will go again. Only when GTA 6 is released and they can compare the fan map to the real thing will they find out just how accurate their work has been.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Leonida Keys Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, hanging over the GTA 6 mapping project is the potential for Rockstar parent company Take-Two to shut the whole thing down.

The mod itself was based on the GTA 6 mapping project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, I asked Garza if he was worried about potential action from Take-Two, and he admitted to "some mild concern."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This project has been going on for quite some time with no direct disruption to our community," Garza continued. "However, I always keep it into consideration if they intend on communicating with us in the future for any reason. We do not explicitly showcase leaked material in the map, so I do not believe they would take that down in particular. I believe they are aware that this project gathers popularity and interest in the game, since everyone wants to see how the world may look like. This can be one of the reasons why they haven’t done anything, since it’s not too negative. If I were ever in the situation of receiving a cease and desist though, then I would respectfully cease and desist. As we get closer to a precise map, it may be possible to receive that notice in the future."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out, we’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2"><u>all the details we’ve discovered so far</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-gta-6-trailer-2-out-in-the-wild-the-fan-theories-are-coming-thick-and-fast-and-some-sound-pretty-plausible"><u>all the GTA 6 fan theories emerging from Trailer 2 itself</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-massive-profits-are-too-big-for-a-studio-with-our-size-to-handle"><u>couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated</u></a>. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>signing a deal with Sony</u></a> to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP. It later launched the game on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Palworld’s huge launch, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company went down the patent route. They want 5 million yen (approx $32,846) each plus late payment damages, as well as an injunction against Palworld that would block its release.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In November, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-reveals-patents-at-the-heart-of-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-lawsuit-and-how-much-money-its-being-sued-for"><u>Pocketpair confirmed the three Japan-based patents</u></a>, which revolve around catching Pokémon in a virtual field, it is being sued over. Palworld <em>does</em> include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, similar to the mechanic seen in the 2022 Nintendo Switch exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus"><u>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Half a year later, Pocketpair has now provided an update admitting recent changes made to the game were indeed the result of the legal threats. Pocketpair confirmed that Patch v0.3.11, released in November 2024, was the result of the ongoing litigation - as players suspected. This patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pal Spheres and instead changed it to a static summon next to the player. Several other game mechanics were also changed with this patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair said that if it hadn’t made these changes to Palworld, “the alternative would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience for players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it doesn’t stop there. Pockeptpair said that today's Patch v0.5.5 makes further changes to Palworld so that gliding will be performed using a glider rather than with Pals. Pals in the player's team will still provide passive buffs to gliding, but players will now need to have a glider in their inventory in order to glide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair called these changes “compromises” the studio is being forced to make out of fear of an injunction being granted that could block the development and sale of Palworld.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We understand that this will be disappointing for many, just as it is for us, but we hope our fans understand that these changes are necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of Palworld,” Pocketpair said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite making these changes, Pocketpair said it will continue to dispute the claims made in the lawsuit, focusing on asserting the “invalidity” of the patents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's Pocketpair's statement in full:</p><blockquote>We would like to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation for the continued support of our fans over the past few months. We apologize for not being able to share as much information as we would like, but we trust our fans understand how difficult it is to be fully transparent while litigation is ongoing.</blockquote><blockquote>Currently, we remain involved in prolonged legal proceedings regarding alleged patent infringement. We continue to dispute these claims and assert the invalidity of the patents in question. However, we have had to make certain compromises in order to avoid disruptions to the development and distribution of Palworld.</blockquote><blockquote>On November 30th, 2024, we released Patch v0.3.11 for Palworld. This patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pal Spheres and instead changed it to a static summon next to the player. Several other game mechanics were also changed with this patch. As many have speculated, these changes were indeed a result of the ongoing litigation. Everyone here at Pocketpair was disappointed that this adjustment had to be made, and we fully understand that many players feel the same frustration. Unfortunately, as the alternative would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience for players, it was determined that this change was necessary.</blockquote><blockquote>Furthermore, we regret to inform our players that with the implementation of Patch v0.5.5, we must make yet another compromise. From this patch onward, gliding will be performed using a glider rather than with Pals. Pals in the player's team will still provide passive buffs to gliding, but players will now need to have a glider in their inventory in order to glide.</blockquote><blockquote>We understand that this will be disappointing for many, just as it is for us, but we hope our fans understand that these changes are necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of Palworld.</blockquote><blockquote>We also want to extend our apologies to our fans for the discomfort and concern this ongoing litigation has caused.</blockquote><blockquote>We remain committed to developing Palworld and delivering exciting new content to our fans.<br>On behalf of everyone at Pocketpair and Team Palworld, thank you again for your continued support.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">At the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood">IGN sat down for an extended conversation with John “Bucky” Buckley, communications director and publishing manager for Palworld developer Pocketpair</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals (a claim that the person who originally made it has since retracted). He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> a bit on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” to the studio and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
