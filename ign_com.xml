And for good measure, it also contains the non-canon 2000 Game Boy game Metal Gear: Ghost Babel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This collection represents the first time MGS 4 has been available on any platform other than PlayStation 3. With Konami’s thin release schedule over the past decade or so, many fans wondered if the series’ fourth main assignment would <em>ever</em> be released from its PS3 prison. I, for one, am extremely glad to see that happen, because my PS3 is in some box somewhere in my basement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And just like with Vol. 1, you don’t have to buy the whole collection if you only want one game. You can buy each of the included games individually on all the platforms’ digital storefronts.</p><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">More Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">007 First Light Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-disney-afternoon-collection-nintendo-switch-2">Disney Afternoon Collection (Switch) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-where-to-buy">Forza Horizon 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-where-to-buy">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-switch-2-where-to-buy">Pokemon Pokopia Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-where-to-buy">Resident Evil Requiem Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saros-ps5-where-to-preorder">Saros Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-switch">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Girls Frontline 2: Exilium recently revealed the new content that’s coming in its next patch on February 19, and there’s a lot. The headliners are two new T-Dolls, Alva and Voymastina, the latter of which is the strongest Doll in the game. Alva will arrive on February 19, and Voymastina will arrive on March 12. On top of that, there’s new story content, limited-time outfits and events, and lots of free rewards.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>New T-Dolls Join the Fray</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Alva, the dependable leader of Task Force DEFY, is the first new Doll to join the roster. Though reserved in demeanor, she is fiercely protective of her squad. She’s a Support-class Doll and excels at providing powerful shields and enhancing team survivability, making her a natural fit for shield-focused teams. With her signature weapon, 6P33, she increases the critical damage of Freeze-based allies and further amplifies the damage of shielded units, turning defense into offense. She synergizes particularly well with Robella, creating a 1+1&gt;2 effect, and her arrival marks the full realization of shield-centric Freeze teams.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/alva-kv-update-1770923971757.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The new story content, called Corposant, will be released in three parts on February 19, February 26, and March 12. It features CG animations and delivers an experience comparable to a visual novel, with more than 100,000 English words. When the final chapter launches on March 12, it will also introduce the highly anticipated new Doll Voymastina, who is officially recognized as the strongest second-generation Doll in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Codenamed “White Mastiff,” Voymastina is a physical-team core damage dealer who specializes in defense-ignoring capabilities, delivering massive physical damage through both active and support attacks. Her exclusive effect, Predator’s Principle, boosts burst damage, while Eye of the White Mastiff enables sustained offensive pressure. Debuting alongside her is the Elite assault rifle 6P71 (Medium Ammo), Voymastina’s imprinted signature weapon, designed to complete her combat profile and reinforce her role as a top-tier damage dealer.
</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/voymastina-kv-available-on-12-march-1770924024983.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Free Goodies on the Way</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The patch will add lots of new free rewards, led by the ability to earn 55+ pulls, 11,000+ Collapse Pieces, an Elite Doll (Balthilde), and a Commander outfit during the themed Corposant event that launches February 19.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, there are multiple upcoming log-in events that can score you additional goodies. Starting February 19, you can log in to receive 10 Targeted Access Permissions (which are used to pull for characters) and sign in to receive another 10. And another event starts March 12, where you can get an additional 10. Also starting February 19, you can get one reward mail every week, each containing one Access Permission, 100 Collapse Pieces (which can be used to get more Targeted Access Permissions), and 100 Next-Gen Memory Sticks (which can be used to increase your affinity with individual Dolls).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From February 19 to April 1, the limited-time Splash Bash event introduces a PK-style gameplay mode featuring interactive matchups between Dolls and players. There’s streamlined gameplay guidance and stage-clearing tips, making the mode a light but competitive change of pace. And you can unlock the exclusive Commander outfit Leisurely Heat by participating.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/splash-bash-gameplay-1770924061482.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of all this, the upcoming patch will also add limited-time discounts on three new outfits: Alva - Antje, Lenna - Flying Phantom, and Nikketa - Night on the Silver Bay. And there will be a new permanent gameplay mode called Ashen Tales in Artifact Recovery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As always, Girls Frontline 2: Exilium will continue to release more new content in the future. In the next six months, you can expect extensive story updates, new gameplay modes, new Dolls and outfits, and collaborations with other major IPs.
