While Ubisoft released updates to Viking era England-set Valhalla and Ancient Egypt-set Origins, Ancient Greece-set Odyssey is still without a fix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hello everyone, we have just deployed a new title update for Assassin's Creed Valhalla," Ubisoft said on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208920/Assassins_Creed_Valhalla/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam page</a>, alongside a similar one on Origins'. "This patch fixes compatibility issues with Windows 11 update 24H2."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These "compatibility issues" saw the Assassin's Creed games crash every few minutes, essentially rendering them unplayable. While Ubisoft released fixes for other affected games Star Wars Outlaws and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora relatively quickly, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-users-are-review-bombing-assassins-creed-origins-because-microsofts-24h2-windows-update-has-bricked-the-game">disgruntled Assassin's Creed fans review bombed their games on Steam in an attempt to prompt action.</a></p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mainline Assassin's Creed Games in Chronological Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This finally came two months later, though obviously Odyssey remains broken.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-shooter-fortunes-run-on-hold-because-the-developer-is-going-to-prison<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I've lived a very different life before I was a game developer."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer of well-received Steam Early Access first-person shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortunes-run">Fortune's Run</a> has ceased work on the game after receiving a three-year prison sentence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a shock announcement on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805318" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Fortune’s Run Steam page</a>, sole developer Dizzie explained “why the development is imploding.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“First of all, I have some stuff going on I need to make public as it's going to interrupt development,” Dizzie said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I've been sentenced to prison for the next three years. It's a long story, but I've lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn't living very well. My case is about five years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I've been working on this. I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I'm going away next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a shame, but it's the consequences of my actions. I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life. Unfortunately, the sentence isn't going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So the game isn't totally dead, but unfortunately due to even further bad things happening, it's unclear what will happen.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortune's Run launched in early access form on Steam in September 2023 and met with a "very positive" user review rating. Its blend of quick-fire first-person shooter elements with immersive sim mechanics inspired by the likes of Deus Ex and Thief caught the attention of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/amid-a-legendary-autumn-for-pc-gaming-a-team-of-three-developers-quietly-released-one-of-the-best-shooters-you-can-play-right-now-into-early-access/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>, which called Fortune's Run "one of the best shooters you can play right now." Dizzie was one of just two developers working on the game, the other being her wife, Arachne, although she recently left the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dizzie refused to reveal the exact nature of the sentence or the charges, but insisted she did not commit “a sex crime.” “What I did was wrong and that's all you need to know,” Dizzie added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dizzie also told Fortune’s Run fans that the case dates from “before I met the other dev,” which is a reference to Arachne. “She is not related to it in any way,” Dizzie added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It appears to be the case that Arachne left the project following a significant surgery last summer. “Like I said, the other dev was recovering from a botched surgery,” Dizzie said. “If you want to accuse me of something, accuse me of stressing her out with my legal problems and my crazy work schedule.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The other developer has left the project,” Dizzie’s message continued. “Once she recovered, she decided that she was no longer interested in game development. She was in charge of [quality assurance] and a few level segments, all of which [have] been abandoned and I've been forced to get by on my own for the past while. It's been very difficult to do alone but I actually managed, by basically not sleeping, to complete all of the work in time so that it could be released before I'm sent away.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, the prison sentence puts an end to Fortune’s Run development, although Dizzie insisted it will begin again upon release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since we [Dizzie and Arachne] decided to part ways, development will be completely interrupted until I'm released,” Dizzie said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there's absolutely nothing I can do. These wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it's just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I want to underline that I'm no longer in financial dire straits since our game actually sold okay, so I should be able to afford rent once I get out, so there's a chance that if you wait a few years I'll be able to cap off the release. In fact, there's not very much content left to work on; I've been making stubs and prototypes of the missing levels in my spare time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I am extremely passionate about this stuff and I'm never going to stop making games. I'd like to finish this one, but I don't know what will happen. I'm going to do my best, because I love this game and I want to finish it. Seriously, I just want to finish it. Finish it already, Dizzie!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805320" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a separate post on Steam</a>, Dizzie published patch notes for a new Fortune’s Run update and mentioned an upcoming post that will detail work set to take place next month before her prison sentence begins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3">Space Marine 2 has done so well it “changes everything” for Saber Interactive</a>, Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN soon after the game came out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But via <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/ost7hseic9hc/1alE9DriNd0GJq1SYKn3ZY/e14d3ff03635ea919c569f075b25c60a/2024-25_half_year_report_final.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new financial results</a> we now know just how much money it has made for Games Workshop, the British company behind the tabletop hobby upon which Space Marine 2 is based. Reporting results for the first half of its financial year ending December 1, 2024, Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree hailed the success of Space Marine 2, which contributed significant royalty revenue to the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, licensing revenue from royalty income increased in the period by a whopping £18 million (approx. $21.9 million) to £30.1 million (approx. $36.7 million). Earned income, which is the key figure here, was £26.1 million (approx. $31.8 million), up from £5.9 million (approx. $7.2 million), an increase Games Workshop said was mainly from Space Marine 2. 98% of Games Workshop’s total licensing revenue came from PC and console games (Space Marine 2 launched on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A win all round, then. As you'd expect, Games Workshop is on the hunt for the next blockbuster Warhammer video game, but Rountree also expressed a degree of caution on potential future video game success, admitting hits like Space Marine 2 are few and far between.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement:</p><blockquote>During the period, our licensing partners launched two new video games; Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, a third person shooter for PC and console and Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks, a combat racing game. Established games continue to contribute, alongside royalty income earned following the success of Space Marine 2. We recognise that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games. Clearly we are looking for the next one. We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">So, where could this big Warhammer video game hit come from? It seems inevitable that Saber Interactive will get the chance to continue the Space Marine story with Space Marine 3, and indeed has said it has ideas for a third game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Bulwark Studios’ turn-based tactics game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-mechanicus-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus II</a> looks set to scratch a very different itch. There are also rumblings that Creative Assembly is finally giving Warhammer 40,000 the Total War treatment, something fans have hoped for for years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Space Marine 2, Saber continues to update the game with cosmetics, new Operations, and new weapons. Season 3 is set for launch this spring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-officially-ends-after-final-update-offline-mode-and-true-ending<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League just received its final update, which along with the promised offline mode, adds an official ending to the game's story that wraps everything up in a tidy, if rather uninteresting, way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously announced, Episode 8: Balance is the final update planned for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Alongside some new armore and exotic weapons, the biggest feature in the update is a new Offline Mode that will allow players to continue playing Suicide Squad Game by themselves without requiring an internet connection.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">As a reminder, Episode 8 will be the final update to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuicideSquadGame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#SuicideSquadGame</a>. The title will remain playable in both Online and the recently released Offline Mode for players to continue to wreak havoc in Metropolis 💥</p>— Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League (@suicidesquadRS) <a href="https://twitter.com/suicidesquadRS/status/1879238211643605436?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Offline Mode was announced in December 2023 as part of Rocksteady's post-launch plans, but the studio was also committed to releasing its promised DLCs and additional characters, leaving the Offline Mode for its final update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a big comic book ending to wrap up the story of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, <strong>so if you're okay with spoilers feel free to read below the break. You've been warned.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay so Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, as the name implies, is about taking out members of the Justice League who have been brainwashed by Brainiac. One of the biggest shocks in the game was when Harley Quinn <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kevin-conroys-batman-is-completely-wasted-in-suicide-squad">shoots Batman point blank in the head</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Batman was actually still alive. In his masterful gambit, he allowed Brainiac to create clones of the Justice League and then oversaw the events of the game from the shadows as he worked to take down Brainiac in secret.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ending is told via the comic book illustrations that the different post-launch episodes have been presented in and in true comic book fashion, your favorite heroes are still all alive and the bad guys are defeated. Woo-hoo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this how Rocksteady envisioned the end of Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League? Who can say. The game released to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-worst-reviewed-games-of-2024">mixed reviews</a> and Warner Bros. said the game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">fell short of expectations</a> when it came to sales, and the developers announced that it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-confirms-its-pulling-the-plug-on-new-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-content-after-season-4">ending future updates</a> on the game after Season 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can read our full review of Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League here and for anyone looking to play the game, the Offline Mode means you're able to fully. So if you see it on sale next time, don't worry about picking it up as the game will still run just fine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
