The series is best known for its deep narratives, excellent turn-based combat, and beloved characters. However, it's hard not to argue that the Persona franchise has grown as much as it has thanks to its music. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to purchasing video game soundtracks, what better way to enjoy them than on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-bluetooth-record-players">vinyl</a>? Many of the Persona soundtracks were quite hard to obtain on vinyl previously, whether due to high prices or limited availability. Now, however, iam8bit and Atlus have teamed up once more to create brand-new, moderately priced releases that you can now pre-order at IGN Store.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Check Out The Persona Vinyl Collection at IGN Store!</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">First up, you can pre-order the entire <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review">Persona 3 Reload</a> soundtrack on Vinyl with the 4xLP release, featuring Holographic Broken Glass Vinyl. Additionally, the entire <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/20/persona-q-shadow-of-the-labyrinth-review">Persona Q - Shadow of the Labyrinth</a> soundtrack can be pre-ordered as a 4xLP as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, three brand-new vinyl releases are available to pre-order. iam8bit unveiled Megamix versions of Persona 3 Reload, Persona 4, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/29/persona-5-review">Persona 5</a>. These new releases pack in the very best tracks from each of these games into one 1xLP vinyl for only $29.99. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, you can pre-order the 3xLP release for Persona 4 Arena and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/30/persona-4-arena-ultimax-review">Persona 4 Arena Ultimax</a>. As the fighting game spin-off of Persona 4, you can expect a much heavier and fun spin on iconic tracks like Reach Out To The Truth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of these Persona vinyl are quickly selling at IGN Store, so be sure to secure your treasure while you still can!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-requests-subpoena-of-discord-to-track-down-user-behind-last-years-pokemon-teraleak<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is requesting a subpoena from a California court that, if granted, would force Discord to give it information about the identity of the person behind last year's massive Pokemon leak, known as the "FreakLeak" or the "TeraLeak".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to court documents <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/561817/pokemon-teraleak-nintendo-discord-subpoena" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seen and reported on by Polygon</a>, Nintendo is requesting the courts order Discord to proide the name, address, phone number, and email address of a Discord user known as "GameFreakOUT". Last October, GameFreakOUT is alleged to have posted content including copyright-protected artwork, characters, source code, and other materials related to pokemon to a Discord server called "FreakLeak," after which they were distributed widely across the internet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though not confirmed, the materials were likely obtained in a data breach back in August that Game Freak <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-developer-game-freak-reportedly-hacked-stolen-data-on-unannounced-games-as-well-as-nintendo-switch-2-codename-leaked-online">disclosed the following October. </a>Per Game Freak, the data breach included 2,606 cases of current, former, and contract employee names being accessed. Oddly, leaked files began appearing online on October 12, and Game Freak's statement appeared online the following day, but was backdated to October 10 and does not mention confidential company materials beyond employee information.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The leaked materials included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-developer-game-freak-reportedly-hacked-stolen-data-on-unannounced-games-as-well-as-nintendo-switch-2-codename-leaked-online">numerous unannounced projects</a>, as well as cut content and other background information and early builds of other Pokemon games. Notably, the leak unveiled Pokemon Champions, an upcoming battle-focused Pokemon game, prior to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-champions-game-freaks-leaked-multiplayer-game-officially-revealed">game's official announcement in February</a>. It also contained information about the upcoming Pokemon Legends: Z-A that has since been proven correct, alongside yet-to-be-proven information on the next generation of Pokemon, source code for various DS pokemon titles, meeting summaries, and cut lore from Pokemon Legends: Arceus and other games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has not yet filed suit against a hacker or leaker in response, but given the subpoena it seems likely Nintendo is trying to find the identity of the person responsible in hopes of doing so. Nintendo historically has been highly litigious about everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamer-sent-nintendo-a-letter-boasting-he-had-a-thousand-burner-channels-to-stream-pirated-nintendo-games-from-and-could-do-this-all-day-now-nintendo-has-sued-him-for-millions-of-dollars">piracy</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-officially-suing-palworld-developer-over-multiple-patent-infringements">patent infringement</a>, so if the subpoena is granted, it is perhaps only a matter of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-hasbro-brings-some-of-the-greatest-star-wars-icons-to-life-star-wars-celebration-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro revealed quite an impressive lineup of new toys and collectibles at Star Wars Celebration 2025, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hasbro-reveals-new-the-mandalorian-figures-at-star-wars-celebration-2025">new The Mandalorian figures</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hasbro-reveals-incredible-new-dash-rendar-and-jedi-survivor-figures-star-wars-celebration-2025">a long-overdue Dash Rendar figure</a>. They also had many of these upcoming releases on display at the show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN was able to snap some photos of Hasbro's Star Wars Celebration display and speak to designer Chris Reiff and Hasbro Marketing's Jing Houle about the thrill of designing toys based on these iconic characters. Check out the slideshow gallery below for a closer look at these new toys, and then read on to find out what Reiff and Houle had to say, including why there's still room to improve with some of the biggest heroes of the Star Wars franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor fans were no doubt pleased to see new figures included in this new crop of Star Wars toys. Nightsister Merrin is getting a new figure (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QKOrp8?object_uuid=7a4d7785-2b5c-433d-89ce-6009126c41a6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>), while series star Cal Kestis is featured in a three-pack set alongside Turgle and Skoova Stev (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QL5mKb?object_uuid=7a4d7785-2b5c-433d-89ce-6009126c41a6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DKL96SMQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>). And best of all, Cal comes with multiple swap-out heads, including one with handlebar mustache. According to Houle, that particular look was a big priority for this release.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hasbro's Star Wars Celebration 2025 Display Booth</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Honestly, we just wanted to have fun with it," Houle tells IGN. "This is one of my favorite packs that we revealed in the panel. We actually started with the handlebar mustache and the mullet and then added in the clean cut. Then the short beard later. So for us, the primary look is almost the handlebar and it's just so much fun."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Merrin, it was a given that Cal be joined by his crewmate,  given how important Merrin is to the larger Fallen Order/Survivor saga. The challenge was properly depicting her unique Force abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's tough to have Cal without Merrin," Reiff says. "So we're glad we finally got to Merrin, but doing that Force effect, the green blast coming there, all the great detail of that new costume and the face tattoos with the inkjet. Just some beautiful subtlety going on there. She's a really cool character I know we know fans are invested in and really being able to build out that world."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year's toy lineup includes two characters who are certainly no strangers to Hasbro by now - Han Solo and Chewbacca. (See <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6o13Z?object_uuid=7a4d7785-2b5c-433d-89ce-6009126c41a6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DGJ1HX1P" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Han</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/924YN5?object_uuid=7a4d7785-2b5c-433d-89ce-6009126c41a6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DGJ58GHR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chewie</a> at Amazon) But despite how many Han and Chewie figures we've seen over the years, Houle is adamant that there's room for improvement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I mean, we haven't done them in a long time," Houle says. "They needed an update, so we gave them fully new tools so they're brand new with the latest articulation so that fans can really celebrate and enjoy... classic characters out again in the latest technology and articulation that we have. And they've made quite a few updates on top of the articulation just in general. We learned a lot from the Wookiees that we've done where they have really long hair."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Houle continues, "And so, despite the long hair, having softer plastics so he can still pivot and move his head in a seamless way, that was really important to us. And we added articulation into Han too, but we didn't give him the thigh break because we didn't want to separate the red bars on his right side of the outside of the thigh. So we thought it was important to keep that clean. So we added articulation to the top of the boot instead."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Everything Revealed at Hasbro's Star Wars Celebration 2025 Panel</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">No figure in this lineup is more striking than The Ronin, based on the anime anthology series Star Wars: Visions. True to the series, The Ronin is a black-and-white figure whose only color comes from his red katana lightsaber. Because The Ronin is a Celebration-exclusive release, it was important to both Houle and Reiff that they get the small details right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I love that we kept to it," Houle says. "And then taking from learnings from what we know about Japanese culture and stuff, the way the box is built, how premium it looks, the magnets that let it open, how clean it looks, the watercoloring, the accessories that's hidden on the top of the box so you don't just see it. Everything. There was so much attention from packaging to design to engineering."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reiff adds, "And even the Japanese language for this exclusive packaging, we don't do that normally, but for here, because we're here in Japan, we wanted to really embrace all that and do a special package that was just Japanese language for that too."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Hasbro also had something for fans of the 1:1 scale Black Series helmet line, revealing a stunningly detailed Death Trooper helmet during their Celebration panel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[It's] a great fully new tooled helmet for the Black series Premium roleplay line," Reiff says. "It looks like it's straight out of the movie with the weathering, the lighting detail, and you poke a button on the side and you control the chin lights and the spectre sensor lights over on the side. So, just a great addition to our line. And working with Lucasfilm in partnership to work from original files so that we could really nail all the details of this helmet and then add our own stuff to the inside because the real ones never had an inside, but this one does. All our other helmets, it has the full detailed interior."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Star Wars Celebration, find out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-starfighter-movie-ryan-glosling-plot-story-timeline">what we know about the plot of Star Wars: Starfighter</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-celebration-japan-2025-the-biggest-news-and-moments">see the biggest news and moments from Celebration</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

But to tide everyone over, today Wizards of the Coast just offered a first look at over a dozen never-before-seen new cards from the set, including Sephiroth, Yuffie, Cecil, Garland, Chaos, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new look includes a number of new cards and a handful of art variations, alongside the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers">four commander cards</a> we've already gotten a look at: Tidus, Cloud, Y'shtola, and Terra. In addition to various powerful legendaries like Sephiroth and Cecil, we also get a look at a new Food token art, and art variations on cards such as Stilzkin, Moogle Merchant; Sin, Spira's Punishment; and Summon: Shiva. You can see the full gallery below:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Set First Looks</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's reveal also shows off some special features of the set, including Summons, a part of Magic's first-ever Saga creatures that players can call upon for aid in battle (see Summon: Shiva in the gallery). Additionally, double-faced cards make a return, as seen with Cecil's two sides: Dark Knight and Redeemed Paladin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In total, the Final Fantasy set will feature over 100 legendary creature cards, including 55 legendary borderless cards, some of which are drawn by fan-favorite artists from across Final Fantasy history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering's Final Fantasy set will be a fully draftable, Standard-legal set that will release alongside four preconstructed Commander decks, one themed after each of four Final Fantasy games: 6, 7, 10, and 14. Each deck consists of 100 cards, a mix of both new Final Fantasy cards, as well as existing cards with new Final Fantasy art. The set launches on June 13.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social. Got a story tip?
