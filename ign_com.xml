Or you could actually <em>gift </em>them, if you want? There are also discounts on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPbkej?object_uuid=77df69be-79ed-4d43-9678-fc8a21595768&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fortnite V-Bucks</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/91b0Dq?object_uuid=77df69be-79ed-4d43-9678-fc8a21595768&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Game Pass Core</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLnkeb?object_uuid=77df69be-79ed-4d43-9678-fc8a21595768&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Roblox Digital Gift Cards</a> if you're so inclined. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-black-friday-sale-2024">Nintendo already revealing its Black Friday plans</a>, similar announcements from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-slim-console-black-friday-2024">PlayStation</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-deals-black-friday-what-to-expect-2024">Xbox</a> are expected in the coming days.

Leading up to the big event, retailers have begun to open deals online. Each day leading up to the event will slowly roll out more deals, which ultimately leads to massive discounts on Black Friday. Retailers will not reveal their biggest Black Friday deals until the big day, but most general deals will be available well in advance, such as this excellent discount on gift cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.
