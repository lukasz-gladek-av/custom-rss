            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/first-official-look-at-new-battlefield-gameplay-as-ea-reveals-battlefield-labs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has delivered the first official look at the new Battlefield game as part of an announcement around player testing and its development set-up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The brief glimpse at pre-alpha Battlefield gameplay comes as part of a video revealing what EA calls Battlefield Labs and an accompanying call to arms for playtesters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, EA revealed Battlefield Studios, the umbrella branding for the four studios it has working on the new Battlefield. These are the series’ main Stockholm, Sweden-based developer, DICE, Dead Space remake and Star Wars: Squadrons developer Motive, U.S. studio Ripple Effect (formerly known as DICE LA), and UK studio Criterion, whose work on Need For Speed has now come to an end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DICE in Sweden is building the multiplayer for the new Battlefield. Motive is working on single-player missions and multiplayer maps. Ripple Effect is working on bringing in new players to the Battlefield franchise. And Criterion is working on the single-player campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As already announced, the new Battlefield sees the return of a traditional single-player linear campaign after 2021’s Battlefield 2042 went multiplayer only.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA said its collective Battlefield Studios teams are now entering a “critical” phase of the development cycle, and want player feedback on what to prioritize, improve, and refine before release. To that end, Battlefield Labs will see EA test almost everything but not everything players see will be complete. Participants will have to agree to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) before getting in.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/03/bf-labs-concept-art-1738588148146.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield Labs is designed to bring in playtesters for the new Battlefield. Concept art credit: Electronic Arts.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Even in pre-alpha, we are proud of where the game is at,” EA said. “We tirelessly playtest, but your feedback will supercharge our development as we strive to hit that perfect note between form, function, and feel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is an unprecedented moment for Battlefield. We will start by testing the pillars of play, like core combat and destruction. Then transition to balance and feedback for our weapons, vehicles and gadgets, ultimately leading to where all these pieces come together in our maps, modes, and squad play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And yes, we will be testing Conquest and Breakthrough, the heart and soul of our all-out warfare experience, but BF Labs will also be a place to explore new ideas and fine-tune and improve Battlefield pillars like our class system (Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon) to create deeper more strategic play.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Initial invites will be limited to a few thousand participants with servers located in Europe and North America. Over time EA will invite tens of thousands more with support for further territories. It’s worth remembering that while EA is devoting four entire studios to Battlefield, last year it shut down Ridgeline Games, a Seattle-based developer that was working on a new supposedly standalone single-player Battlefield game with more of a story focus, and laid off all its staff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, EA revealed fresh details on its untitled Battlefield game alongside its first concept art. IGN also confirmed that Battlefield will return to a modern setting after stints in World War I, World War II, and the near future. The concept art suggested ship-to-ship and helicopter combat will be part of the new game, and that it will feature natural disasters like wildfires.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Vince Zampella, Head of Respawn &amp; Group GM for EA Studios Organization, referenced Battlefield 3 and 4 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella">an interview with IGN</a>. "I mean, if you look back to the peak or the pinnacle of Battlefield, it's that Battlefield 3... Battlefield 4 era where everything was modern,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I think we have to get back to the core of what Battlefield is and do that amazingly well, and then we'll see where it goes from there. But I think for me, it's that peak of Battlefield-ness is in that Battlefield 3 and 4 days. So I think it's nostalgic for players, for me, for the teams even. Those are kind of the heyday… although I would say 1942 also."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The return to the modern setting represents a course correction for the series after Battlefield 2042, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/once-thought-dead-battlefield-2042-sees-huge-surge-of-players-during-free-weekend"><u>eventually found its footing</u></a> but was otherwise <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-open-beta-specialists-feedback-ea"><u>widely panned for features like Specialists</u></a> — characters that made it seem as if Battlefield was trying to be a hero shooter. Its ambitious 128-player maps also proved unpopular with fans who preferred a more focused experience. Battlefield 2042 eventually went back to supporting 64 players per map, and the next Battlefield plans to stick to that approach. Specialists are also out this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pressure on the next Battlefield is on after 2042’s missteps. EA CEO Andrew Wilson has called it one of the "most ambitious projects in [EA's] history," and based on the sheer number of studios involved, it’s a significant investment. The Battlefield Studios tagline is, “We’re all in on Battlefield.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah, it's definitely betting bigger on Battlefield,” Zampella told IGN in the interview from 2024. “It's going in and expanding what Battlefield is. We have to have the core. The core Battlefield players know what they want. They've been with us forever, they've been amazing supporters. We need to earn their trust back and get them back on our side. And then it's expanding out and getting more players into the universe and seeing what we can do, so when you want a different experience, you don't have to leave Battlefield. You can experience more things within the Battlefield universe. So we're expanding the offerings that we're giving."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has yet to announce a release date, launch platforms, or a final title for the new Battlefield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review.1098969/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Some days I’ve moped about how I'll never get back the feeling I had the first time I played Skyrim. And then Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 arrived on a mighty steed to sweep me off my feet at full gallop. Armed with excellent, skill-focused melee combat and a rousing, action-packed medieval saga fit for a Hollywood blockbuster, it's one part sequel and one part coronation, bringing a lot of the original's ideas to fruition in the same way <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review">The Witcher 3</a> did for CD Projekt Red or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/17/greedfall-review">Greedfall</a> did for Spiders. No game of this scope and scale is without some technical scuff, of course, and its competing design goals are occasionally at war with themselves just as much as our hero Henry is internally. But even still, its majesty is hard to deny.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This tragic tale picks up almost immediately where Kingdom Come: Deliverance left off back in 2018, though I don't necessarily think you need to have played the first one to get up to speed thanks to the main plot being relatively easy to follow and most of the callbacks being well explained as they happen. Henry, a blacksmith's son turned unlikely warrior, is thrown into the middle of dynastic politicking and bloodshed played out by a diverse and complex cast, including your boisterous failson of a liege lord and some truly memorable entrances from real historical figures I don't want to spoil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The star that shines brightest across this expanse of countryside, though, is the city of Kuttenberg. I can't speak about this place in any terms less flattering than to say it might be one of the wonders of the modern RPG world. I don't think I've ever walked the streets of a virtual medieval city that feels this huge, detailed, and most importantly, alive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The layout is based largely on the actual town that still stands today, with parts of it following the modern street grid almost exactly. It's a wonderful place to simply wander around and discover all kinds of urban adventures – from resolving a dispute between two rival sword schools to hunting down a grisly serial killer. Yes, some of the NPCs obviously share the same voice actor and others share the same face – even important side characters, which can be particularly jarring. But it’s hard to get too hung up on that in a place like this. When I first arrived here I was already more than 40 hours into my 120-hour journey, and I spent multiple in-game days gleefully shopping for the sickest duds and best armor I could afford. And that's what arriving in a huge regional capital should make me want to do!</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are around 100 quests, and practically every one was memorable.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The quest variety is what impressed me most of all, and that extends beyond just Kuttenburg. Very rarely are you simply sent to kill some bandits or carry a package to the next town – at least without some kind of interesting twist, moment of emotional turmoil, or decision built in. There are around 100 quests in total and, having done nearly all of them, practically every single one was memorable enough that it would stand out as a highlight in a lesser RPG. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Admittedly, some were slightly better in concept than execution. There was one I stumbled onto completely by accident that took me deep underground and turned my sword-swinging adventure into a horror movie, but ended up being far too short for the dread to really set in. All the same, I never felt like doing side quests ever became a chore, because I knew each one would be its own little complete episode of The Adventures of Henry, stuffed with quality writing and unique objectives. It's a testament to how consistently strong they were that 120 hours did not feel way too long to me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Along the way are expansive, breathtakingly beautiful landscapes spread over two open-world maps, both of which are chock full of meticulously researched details of late medieval Bohemian life. There isn't a ton of variety in terms of geography – it's all wooded hills and meadows, for the most part. But that’s what the region looks like in real life. It's big enough to get lost in, and the contrast between villages and open wilderness varies things up nicely enough. I did find it odd that you can't go into most of the churches, though, since those would be near the top of my list if I were planning a tourist trip through 1400s Europe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the side quests are like episodes of a TV show, the main quest is a big-screen war movie that pulls out all the stops in its ambition, dialogue, and emotional range. Parts of it made me cheer. Parts of it actually brought me to tears. And Henry's ultimate nemesis got under my skin in a way video game bad guys rarely do, making me rethink everything I’d done up to that point in what might be one of the most memorable final encounters I've ever played through. It's mature without being edgy, it drips with historical authenticity, and it has interesting questions to ask you about what it means to be a hero or a villain.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The main quest is like a big-screen war movie that pulls out all the stops.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's somewhat unfortunate, then, that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is both a mostly linear medieval action-drama and an open-world sandbox, and those two concepts don't always play well together. I'm going to skirt around spoilers the best I can, but I need to give a specific example of the worst experience I had. I need to tell you about the Hungarian Camp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In one of the late-game areas, there is a military camp set up by King Sigismund, the evil conquering bastard you've been opposing since the first hour of the first game. I, of course, tried to assault it by myself the second I got there, and was immediately put down like a dog. Fair enough. But for the next 40 hours of adventuring, I was plotting my revenge. A fire was lit in me – motivation to become as much of a badass as possible. I studied with all of the best blademasters. I learned the way of the bow. I saved up for the best armor. I forged, by hand, the very best sword in Bohemia. Next time I showed up at that camp, things were going to be different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, near the end, I went back to the Hungarian Camp Rambo-style and I killed everyone there. Okay, not the cook or the tailor. And not Musa – Musa's cool. But probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 to 40 armed men. This was an empowering and gleeful rush, with difficult combat that tested all of my skills like never before. A real highlight of the entire journey. And these are enemy soldiers, let me remind you! I don't feel like this was an unpredictable or degenerate thing to do.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So it was a downer when, shortly after, I was asked to infiltrate this same camp as a spy, and Henry didn't even so much as mention that he had completely desolated the place and had a bounty on his head so large that the authorities would skip fines and prison and straight-up execute you if you're caught. This is a required story quest with no alternate path, so the ridiculous, frustrating solution was to sneak up on the unkillable quest NPCs several times to talk to them and start the next cutscene before that same NPC spotted me and went running to call the guards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also ruined my near-perfect reputation because I guess killing <em>invading enemy soldiers</em> was a crime the peasants Sigismund is actively oppressing couldn't forgive, and everyone in every town ended up hating me. But this was a major outlier in what was otherwise a hugely engrossing, marathon-length playthrough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other than that one total debacle though, I truly adored almost every minute I spent with Henry and company. The tactical, skill-based sword combat is a sharp refinement of the already great system from the first game, though I felt like at higher levels, the balance of pure stats to player skill skewed too much in favor of the former. You could probably reach the credits without actually getting particularly good at the swordplay, which was certainly not the case in the first one. But it is cleaner, more varied, and smoother to play. Archery, in particular, has improved a lot.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 Open World RPGs</h3><p>The best open world RPGs to play in 2025</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a blacksmithing minigame now, which I found a little bit clunky and unsatisfying, but it's still great to be able to use a sword I made myself in combat. And alchemy has been made way more intuitive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also really like the new perk system, where every level up feels like it gives you multiple choices between meaningful bonuses. In the first one, a lot of perks honestly felt more like side-grades than upgrades. There was a perk that made it so sleeping outside was more restful, but sleeping in a bed, less so. The sequel’s version only has the upside, and not the drawback, which is important if I'm going to spend my hard-earned skill points on something rather than picking it as a character background at the beginning. And while there wasn't a single quest as interesting or different as the monk arc from the original, getting to level up my scholarship and unlock new quest resolutions by destroying my enemies with facts and logic was also great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Did I mention that it runs really well on my 4070 Ti, even at 4K and very high settings? I still can't even run the first Kingdom Come: Deliverance at max settings on this same machine, and that game is seven years old at this point. So the optimization work that was done here deserves a shout. There are also plenty of bugs, but most of them are of the silly sort you screenshot to show your friends that you'd expect in an RPG with this much ambition. Only rarely did something actually disrupt my gameplay.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
