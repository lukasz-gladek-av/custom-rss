            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/will-playstation-follow-xboxs-price-increase-and-what-does-it-mean-for-gta-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Now Nintendo and Xbox have already made the jump to $80 games, surely it's only a matter of time until PlayStation follows.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raises-the-price-of-all-xbox-series-consoles-xbox-games-confirmed-to-hit-80-this-holiday">a suite of price hikes to its consoles and accessories</a>, plus a price increase for games to $80 USD confirmed coming later this year. The repercussions of this announcement is seismic and far-reaching in ways we have yet to see, and will have major consequences not just for third-party game prices, but likely PlayStation consoles as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is not an exaggeration to say this is the most expensive gaming has been since the 1990s. Microsoft announced that its lowest tier console, the Xbox Series S with a little over 500GB of storage now costs $380 USD. That’s less than $20 cheaper than a PlayStation 5 Slim Digital Astro Bot bundle on the PlayStation store. The 2TB Xbox Series X is now $729, which is about $30 more expensive than a PS5 Pro.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Xbox move is on the heels of Nintendo’s Switch 2 announcement, which created waves not only <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/industry-analysts-react-to-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-chaos-due-to-tariffs-we-are-living-in-unhinged-times">due to the console price of $450 for the Switch 2</a> itself, but the $80 price tag on certain first-party games like Mario Kart World. Nintendo, which previously priced its games at $60, skipped <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-full-priced-first-party-games-will-be-70">the $70 mark drawn by Xbox and PlayStation</a> at the start of this generation (which in itself caused huge uproar) and went straight to $80. Now Xbox will follow that lead this holiday when first party Xbox games will also hit that threshold, and it’s hard to believe the price increases will stop there.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Will PlayStation Games Increase to $80?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are on Sony to see whether it will follow the path led by Nintendo and Xbox, but I’m almost certain it’ll announce price hikes in the coming weeks. The rising cost of manufacturing and the tariffs from the US Trade War means that Sony must raise prices just to deal with the economic realities of the world today. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hypothetically, even if Sony were less impacted by the tariffs than Microsoft — which is almost certainly the reason why Xbox raised prices — Sony has the more successful hardware, and to not raise prices in the face of competition from both Xbox and Nintendo is leaving money on the table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But more than console prices, it’s even more certain that Sony will raise the price of its first-party PlayStation games. The company has repeatedly touted the inherent value of its games line-up as a valuable experience worth a premium. There is no world in which Sony views its first-party games as being worth less than Xbox first-party games given their continued critical and commercial success. So if Xbox is raising first-party game prices, I think Sony will too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s even precedent for Sony’s steadfast belief in the value of its first-party IP. The company stood by its decision to release Housemarque’s last game, Returnal, at $70 despite widespread criticism from fans who’ve previously known Housemarque for delivering great-but-smaller experiences direct to digital. Knowing what we know about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-pressured-its-studios-to-make-big-cuts-amid-increasing-development-costs"><u>how much it even costs to make Sony’s biggest first-party games</u></a>, an $80 price tag feels inevitable.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Death of Physical Games</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the increase in console and game prices, the price hikes reflect an opportunity for corporations to fast-track something they’ve been working towards for a long time: A move to subscription services and digital games, and the end of physical media.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Digital games and subscription services owned and operated by platform holders like PlayStation and Xbox earn more in revenue than physical media and used game sales. That is why PlayStation and Xbox have made such heavy investments into promoting services like PlayStation Plus and especially Xbox Game Pass. As far as we know, Xbox Game Pass is not receiving a price hike (it did of course <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-were-inevitable-analysts-say"><u>go up in price the middle of 2024</u></a>), and with Xbox games soon to be $80, its value for the price-conscious consumer may as well have increased given the savings subscribing to Game Pass earns compared to buying even a single first-party Xbox game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a lover of physical media, I’ve been watching this trend of funneling users towards digital services and sales with dismay, and the price hikes on physical media might take us towards an all-digital future even faster than anticipated by anyone.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What Does This Mean for GTA 6 and Everyone Else?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The handbreaks are well and truly off. Even before the trade war and since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2023, the games industry has had to reckon with declining profits and increasing development costs. Questions around whether the current pricing of games and consoles were sustainable began to circulate among industry insiders and analysts, and they have now manifested in higher costs for consoles like the PlayStation 5 Pro and Switch 2, as well as first-party games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With first-party companies firmly moving towards raising its prices, the likely final signal to confirm whether this pricing increase is a blip or a permanent move is GTA 6 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">when it eventually comes out in 2026</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea that Grand Theft Auto 6 could be priced at $100 began as an analyst’s prediction, but quickly gained traction among the wider games industry. After all, with billions of dollars poured into GTA 6’s development, and over a decade of time spent on making the game, Take-Two is looking to maximise profits from what is very easily the most-anticipated game of the decade, perhaps ever. In the past, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has said games are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publisher-ceo-thinks-videogame-prices-are-very-very-low-for-what-they-offer" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>priced “very, very low” compared</u></a> to the value they offer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Rockstar finally reveals the release date for Grand Theft Auto 6 I’m extremely confident it will cost $80 <em>at the minimum</em>. Of course, that doesn’t mean that everything will cost $80 – games like Helldivers 2 and more recently Split Fiction have proved there’s huge interest in lower priced games that fall just outside the traditional triple-A blockbuster sphere – and many will sacrifice playing a game on day one if it means they can pick it up in a sale a few weeks or months down the line. But one thing’s for sure, prices are only going in one direction in the future and for many of us, that means we’ll have to be a little more choosy over what we buy and play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em><br>

Also, I really doubt it will release on May 26, they will delay it more,” said a somewhat concerned Puzzleheaded-Hunt731.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is also speculation Rockstar may release GTA 6 on PC at the same time as on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, now the game has been delayed to 2026. “I hope that means that a PC version is also coming in 2026 and not 2027,” said Kiwibom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“2026 console release, late 2027 PC release, 2028 new-gen console release,” predicted Velkoadmiral.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s own commenters had plenty to say about the GTA 6 delay, too, with user BSideleau slamming the console generation thus far in a scathing post:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Surprising no one. It will be a final game of this tepid generation. What a let down. I have never felt more grifted than by Microsoft and Sony this generation. Both consoles are more 0.5 updates from the previous generation than true next gen consoles, yet they expected us to pay MORE for them. Quit letting them get away with it. Demand better.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also plenty of talk about how much GTA 6 will cost. With both Nintendo and Microsoft going to $80 for some of their games, fans are bracing themselves for an $80 GTA 6. Some believe it could cost even more, going up to $100 perhaps, if the new GTA Online is included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its statement, Rockstar said “we look forward to sharing more information with you soon.” Could this mean Trailer 2 isn’t far off? Fans certainly hope so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 isn’t just expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time, fans expect it to be one of the greatest games ever made. Under that enormous pressure, the developers at Rockstar and parent company Take-Two will be desperate to ensure the game launches at the highest possible quality level. With that in mind, this delay feels like it was always going to happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Rockstar issues statement.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has delayed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> to May 26, 2026. It was due out fall 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement, Rockstar apologized for the significant delay to the game, expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected," Rockstar said. "The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We look forward to sharing more information with you soon."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar's statement at least confirms the GTA 6 release date, but there were no new assets released, which means the wait for Trailer 2 continues. There's also no mention of launch platforms, which some are already speculating leaves the door open to GTA 6 releasing on PC as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S in May 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look, there's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things," Strauss Zelnick, the boss of Rockstar parent company Take-Two responded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/boss-of-gta-6-and-borderlands-4-owner-take-two-says-it-will-time-its-releases-to-respect-the-consumers-need-to-spend-a-lot-of-time-playing-these-hit-games-before-they-go-on-to-the-next">when IGN asked how confident he was that Rockstar would hit fall 2025 for GTA 6</a>. "So we feel really good about it." That was back in February.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Commenting in a new note to the investment community issued today, May 2, Zelnick said he supported the decision to delay GTA 6 into Take-Two's 2027 financial year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We support fully Rockstar Games taking additional time to realize their creative vision for Grand Theft Auto VI, which promises to be a groundbreaking, blockbuster entertainment experience that exceeds audience expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence. As we continue to release our phenomenal pipeline, we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The delay to GTA 6 opens up the second half of 2025 to a number of other games, perhaps now with more breathing room to succeed. The likes of Gearbox's Borderlands 4, EA's Battlefield, Bungie's Marathon, and Sony's Ghost of Yotei will no-doubt breath a sign of relief. Nintendo, which is preparing to release the Switch 2, will surely benefit from GTA 6's delay, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other developers and publishers who perhaps rushed their games to launch ahead of GTA 6's expected fall 2025 release window won't be so happy, of course. And if you had a game planned for launch in or around May next year, you'll probably have to rethink your release strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

You’ll also know all about that shocking death that arrives just before you make your final escape and, blinking, emerge into the beautiful open world of Cyrodiil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered follow.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The shocking death I’m talking about here is of course the assassination of Emperor Uriel Septim, an assassination he knows is coming and has come to terms with. Veteran fans have replayed Oblivion enough at this point to know it’s coming, too. But back in 2006 when Oblivion first came out, it became a rite of passage to try to save him from the inevitable Mythic Dawn backstab that kicks off the story.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hundreds of arrow shots later and players soon discovered that there was nothing that could be done to save poor old Septim, not without tinkering with the game with mods or console commands. Oblivion only really makes sense if the Emperor dies at the beginning, so it stands to reason that the developers at Bethesda forced it to happen no matter what the player did to try to stop it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, 20 years later, a new generation of Oblivion fans is trying to save the Emperor, and by that I mean trying and failing in much the same way. Players are waiting, bow and arrow primed, for the assassin to emerge from the shadows in a bid to kill him before he stabs the Emperor, but alas, it is no good.</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@_elderscroller/video/7498837496252370206" data-video-id="7498837496252370206"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@_elderscroller?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="@_elderscroller" rel="noopener noreferrer">@_elderscroller</a> A new generation must close shut the Jaws of Oblivion!  <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oblivionremaster?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="oblivionremaster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#oblivionremaster</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oblivionremastered?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="oblivionremastered" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#oblivionremastered</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/obliviongameplay?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="obliviongameplay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#obliviongameplay</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oblivionclips?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="oblivionclips" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#oblivionclips</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oblivion?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="oblivion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#oblivion</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/obliviontok?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="obliviontok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#obliviontok</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/obliviontiktok?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="obliviontiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#obliviontiktok</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/skyrimtok?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="skyrimtok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#skyrimtok</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/skyrimtiktok?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="skyrimtiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#skyrimtiktok</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/elderscrollsoblivion?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="elderscrollsoblivion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#elderscrollsoblivion</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="fyp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#fyp</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7498837444293397279?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - ElderScroller" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ original sound - ElderScroller</a> </section> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Some newcomers to the game didn’t even know they were supposed to talk to the Emperor in the first place, and so ended up with a room full of dead assassins as the endless stream of Mythic Dawn goons emerged to battle the group.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are seeking out their revenge on the Mythic Dawn, piling those corpses high.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Newcomers are also discovering that the assassins will just keep on coming if you don't talk to the Emperor.
