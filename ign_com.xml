I have also had personal experiences where I wanted to play something with the limited time I have but gave up because of the time it takes to level up characters or traverse the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That’s exactly why I think that the Streamlined Progression feature is very effective - to give players smooth access to the story.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade - PC screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix also <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1966514225117118813" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirms</a> that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tetsuya-nomura-offers-promising-update-on-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-and-kingdom-hearts-4">entire Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy</a> will eventually make its way to Switch 2 and Xbox platforms, as well as PS5 and PC.

The PlayStation version has even longer completion times. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game is a traditional single-player JRPG that has your unnamed character and a team of adventurers sailing around, traversing islands, and completing quests to help people out on each one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the art, Square Enix wrote in its announcement, “The character designs, originally crafted by world-renowned manga artist Akira Toriyama, have been reimagined into a charming 3D art style using dolls actually created in the real world.” That’s wild. The graphics look great, though, almost toy-like in that Link’s Awakening remake sort of way.</p><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">Other Preorder Guides</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Feel free to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-september-2025-live-updates-everything-announced">everything else announced during today's Nintendo Direct</a>, including a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2-for-nintendo-switch-where-to-buy">new Super Mario Galaxy bundle</a> for Nintendo Switch. </p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">007 First Light Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Battlefield 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-where-to-buy">Borderlands 4 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-clair-obscur-expedition-33-mirror-edition-ps5-xbox-amazon-exclusive">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Mirror Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Ghost of Yotei Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorders">Kirby Air Riders Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch">Pokemon Legends Z-A Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-story-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2-for-nintendo-switch-where-to-buy">Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-pc">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Silver Tempest remains one of the most collector-driven Sword and Shield era sets, and prices reflect the tug-of-war between nostalgia, competitive play, and scarcity. Alternate arts and Trainer Gallery cards dominate collector demand, while competitive staples like Lugia VSTAR continue to influence the market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the climbing side, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a01g8m?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lugia V (Alternate Full Art) 186/195</a> has skyrocketed 68% since July, now sitting at $427, cementing itself as the premier chase card of the set.

This alternate art is widely considered the premier chase card of Silver Tempest, both for its place in the competitive Lugia VSTAR archetype and for its stunning artwork showing Lugia emerging from stormy seas. For investors, this card represents one of the safest long-term holds from the Sword and Shield block, balancing competitive relevance with iconic artwork.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWE1xn?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rayquaza VMAX Trainer Gallery TG20/TG30</a> has more than doubled in value since July, now at $122.72 compared to $71.40. Its Azure Pulse ability, which lets you discard your hand and draw three cards, still provides flexibility in niche decks, and Max Burst remains a strong scaling attack with Energy discards. Much of its price movement comes from the Trainer Gallery art, where Rayquaza dominates the scene in bold colors. With strong nostalgia and limited supply, Rayquaza VMAX looks like a smart mid-range option for investors who prefer artwork-driven cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2PBE?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lugia VSTAR 202/195</a> has risen 44% since July, moving from $23.22 to $33.55. Lugia VSTAR continues to be one of the most powerful cards in the format, with its Summoning Star ability enabling explosive bench setups by recovering Colorless Pokémon from the discard pile. Tempest Dive also provides reliable 220 damage with the bonus of Stadium removal. This Secret Rare version benefits from both its ongoing playability and the prestige of being a high-rarity Lugia card in a set defined by the legendary bird, making it attractive to both competitive players and investors looking for sustained growth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2PBE?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blaziken VMAX Trainer Gallery TG15/TG30</a> has jumped from $11.90 in December 2024 to $28.99 today. Its Max Blaze attack can accelerate Energy to Rapid Strike Pokémon on the bench, and while this synergy is only occasional in competitive play now, the Trainer Gallery artwork featuring May alongside Blaziken has given it collector-driven momentum. As a lower-entry price point compared to Lugia or Rayquaza, it could appeal to investors targeting the Trainer Gallery subset as a whole.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2PBE?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blaziken V Trainer Gallery TG14/TG30</a> has seen an even more dramatic increase, climbing from $10.29 in December 2024 to $28.99. While its attacks are straightforward, the Trainer Gallery artwork again takes center stage. Featuring May with Blaziken in an anime-style presentation, this card has quickly gained momentum as collectors seek to pair it with the VMAX. Investors watching Silver Tempest may see this as a strong example of character-driven cards performing well long-term.</p><p id="crashers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Crashers">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/11/feature-image-20-1757601037368.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QVEOjL?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Regidrago V (Alternate Full Art) 184/195</a> has dropped 12% since July, now sitting at $14.99 compared to its previous $17.13. The card once carried strong hype as the core of Regidrago VSTAR decks, where Celestial Roar could accelerate Energy and Dragon Laser offered splash damage across the board. As the competitive meta moved toward Lugia VSTAR, Charizard ex, and other faster attackers, Regidrago lost ground and demand has followed. From a collector standpoint, the alternate art design remains appealing, featuring Regidrago amidst ancient ruins, but it does not command the same prestige as the Lugia alternate arts, and with high supply on the market the correction feels like a natural leveling of its long-term value.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/akw2d6?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alolan Vulpix VSTAR (Secret) 197/195</a> has slipped around 7% since August, falling to $13.86 from $14.98. Its Silvery Snow Star attack once had situational strength against Pokémon V-heavy decks, dealing up to 350 damage under the right conditions. However, as the format has leaned further into Pokémon ex and efficient single-prize strategies, Vulpix’s impact has weakened. Snow Mirage offered some stall potential, but it has not been enough to hold its place in the current meta. Collectors may still be drawn to the rainbow Secret Rare finish, but with Silver Tempest containing multiple more desirable chase cards, Alolan Vulpix VSTAR has been overshadowed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/98P23w?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lugia V (Full Art) 185/195</a> has dropped 15% since September, down to $10.50 from $12.34. While Lugia VSTAR remains one of the defining cards of the Sword and Shield era, the V card itself sees play mainly as a stepping stone. Players only need a few copies to evolve, and with the card printed in multiple versions, supply is abundant. Collectors often focus on the alternate art or higher-rarity versions of Lugia, leaving this Full Art with less staying power. Its decline reflects a broader trend where supporting cards lose value once the meta cements which versions are most desirable both in play and in collections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aXV5MY?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Serperior V (Trainer Gallery) TG13/TG30</a> has slid from $13.35 in September to $12 today. The card’s Noble Light ability to heal all Pokémon adds an interesting niche, but it also benefits the opponent, making it less practical for most decks. Solar Beam at 120 damage for two Grass Energy looks underwhelming compared to the speed and power of current competitive attackers. What has kept Serperior relevant is the Trainer Gallery artwork featuring Rosa, which gives it crossover appeal among collectors. Still, as prices of Silver Tempest Trainer Gallery cards fluctuate, Serperior has not been able to keep pace with the likes of Rayquaza or Blaziken.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QLMGAO?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lugia V 138/195</a> in its standard Ultra Rare print has seen a decline from $13.51 to $11.44 since September. Similar to the Full Art version, this card’s primary role is as the base for Lugia VSTAR, and demand has cooled as players already hold their playsets. With alternate arts and Secret Rares capturing the majority of collector interest, the standard Ultra Rare finds itself priced closer to utility than prestige. The card is still essential in Lugia-focused decks, with Read the Wind providing early draw power and Aero Dive clearing Stadiums, yet despite this playability, its sheer availability prevents it from holding long-term value above its rarer counterparts.</p><p id="sealed-products-silver-tempest"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sealed Products: Silver Tempest">Silver Tempest Sealed Products</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/11/feature-image-19-1757600934339.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://zdcs.link/zn5nEb?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silver Tempest Booster Box</a> has seen a sharp rise since June, climbing from $350.44 to $464.98 today. As the set continues to age and supply dwindles, sealed boxes remain one of the strongest investment plays for collectors and investors alike, especially with the chase Lugia alternate art driving sustained demand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp48El?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silver Tempest Pokemon Center Elite Trainer Box</a> has also risen significantly, now $305 compared to $183.74 in June. These Pokémon Center exclusives are printed in smaller runs, and as more collectors chase complete Sword and Shield ETB lines, this version of Silver Tempest is proving especially desirable. For investors, the smaller supply pool makes this one of the most reliable sealed options to hold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGrbOV?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silver Tempest Elite Trainer Box</a> has climbed from $77.95 in June to just under $100 today, a steady rise driven by accessibility and the general demand for sealed ETBs. While not as scarce as the Pokémon Center version, it benefits from overall market momentum and remains an approachable option for investors seeking affordable sealed products.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrj4m?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silver Tempest Booster Bundle</a> has risen from $60.63 in June to $70.98, showing that even smaller sealed options are gaining traction as booster boxes become more expensive. Similarly, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeK6R6?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silver Tempest Build &amp; Battle Box</a> has nearly doubled since October 2024, now reaching $31 compared to $16.08. These are lower-cost sealed items that investors may look to stockpile, as they are easier to move in the long run compared to higher-priced boxes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Three-pack blisters have shown some of the most dramatic jumps. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXV5pY?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silver Tempest 3 Pack Blister Manaphy</a> has risen from $13.06 last November to $32.95, while the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbMe5r?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silver Tempest 3 Pack Blister Togetic</a> went from $7.54 in March to $35 today. These spikes reflect both character collector demand and the scarcity of sealed promos from the set. Investors who favor lower-entry sealed products may see these as smart pickups, given their strong growth in a short period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Silver Tempest single boosters have crept up as well, with the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z31PBw?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silver Tempest Sleeved Booster Pack</a> now at $10.49 compared to $9.97 in June and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKqxeY?object_uuid=3ffe7fbf-ed45-4b6c-bc32-92dbecbc7b39&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silver Tempest Booster Pack</a> at $8.09 compared to $6.35. While these increases are smaller in percentage terms, they show the across-the-board upward pressure on all sealed Silver Tempest product, confirming the set’s strength as a long-term hold for investors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
