            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/one-modder-has-already-demonstrated-an-elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One should really never the doubt the tenacity of modders. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is now live, and within 24 hours of its launch, one well-known FromSoftware game modder has already demonstrated a Duos mode mod.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luke Yui, the modder <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-rings-popular-seamless-co-op-mod-playable-once-more-after-creator-re-writes-it-to-work-with-shadow-of-the-erdtree">behind popular co-op mods</a> for games like Elden Ring and Armored Core VI, uploaded a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbKF9TOiMWI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">short video to their YouTube channel yesterday</a>. It shows off an Elden Ring Nightreign two-player mod, allowing just two Nightfarers to team up rather than forcing the choice between one or three.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's important to note that, as of this writing, this is not a public or playable mod, but a short demonstration from Yui. They noted that the mod runs without connecting to the matchmaking server, so while it's possible to use additional mods during gameplay, that also means you're not running through the normal channels. Whether this becomes a real solve or just an interesting curiosity, we'll have to see.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Elden Ring Nightreign can be played solo or in a group of three, there's no option to run it with just two players; you'd need to either kick your friend and run solo, or matchmake and find a third. It might sound like a small hindrance, but for those who like to play with just one pal, it can be a frustration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also a prevailing issue in the early hours of Nightreign's public reception. The lack of a duos setting has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-massive-steam-launch-tarnished-by-mixed-user-reviews-over-lack-of-duos-co-op-voice-chat">been cited in early negative reviews</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-toughest-challenge-so-far-finding-friends-to-play-with">players seem to be struggling with the restriction</a>. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kys8fy/the_nightreign_sub_looking_like_a_threesome_sub/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one user on the Elden Ring subreddit pointed out</a>, the Nightreign-specific subreddit is "looking like a threesome sub" with the number of people seeking one additional player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN, Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki said the team <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players">"kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect,"</a> but it was something the Nightreign team was looking at and considering for post-launch support. With this much desire for a duos-specific mode, I'd imagine it's hard <em>not </em>to take notice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks">Nightreign tips and tricks</a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides">all the eight Nightlord Bosses</a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes">Nightfarer Classes</a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant">How to Unlock the Revenant</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess">How to Unlock the Duchess</a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters">How to Change Characters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

These are unavoidable for players as they tinker with their loadouts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, Activision has added bundle and Battle Pass advertisements to the Events tab, another controversial change that has caused complaints.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s a snippet of the response, sourced from across Call of Duty subreddits, Discords, and social media:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>I wouldn't even be mad if this was just in Warzone, a free game, but putting it in a pay-to-play premium title, with how expensive they're getting? F**k off.</li><li>This game is still 80€ I get that they make most of their money from the store, but I feel like the bare minimum for a premium product would be to not have ads clogging the menus right?</li><li>At this point it really feels like opening up a mobile game with how much more you see an option to buy anything in this game.</li><li>Anyone who wanted this bundle would've checked the store and bought it. Putting it here isn't gonna make more people buy it, its <em>just</em> annoying.</li><li>Just wait until they add pop up ads for bundles while you are playing the game.</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-dutys-squid-game-crossover-event-locks-its-best-rewards-behind-a-new-premium-battle-pass">Call of Duty has had its monetization crises in the past</a>, of course. Players are used to battle passes, premium battle passes, and even more expensive versions of premium battle passes on top of the $70 (soon to be $80) cost of entry. But there is a growing feeling that the franchise’s microtransaction strategy has become even more aggressive following Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s worth noting that earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-game-closures-and-a-declining-audience-call-of-duty-is-in-a-rough-spot-so-whats-next">Activision abandoned <u>Warzone Mobile</u></a>, the game that was meant to lead the battle royale into a new era, with an admission it had not met expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"> IGN has asked Activision for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100. You can reach Wesley at wesley_yinpoole@ign.com or confidentially at wyp100@proton.me.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
