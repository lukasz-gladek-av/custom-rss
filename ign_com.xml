Fellow team agents have often come and gone, and supposedly impossible missions have varied time after time, but Ethan has remained. The only other constant has been a steady supply of villains – men and women with big plans fueled by greed and/or malice, who think they’ll be the one to outwit, outsmart, and outrun Hunt. Fools.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It might seem counterintuitive ranking the Mission: Impossible villains under the banner of “best,” but every great hero needs an equally great villain. Numerous elements come into play when determining the best villain, but we’re zeroing in on the scale of their threat, the weight of the violence (both physical and emotional) they commit against Hunt and his team, and the palpable degree of villainous charisma they exhibit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So cue up that classic Lalo Schifrin theme, here are the 10 Best Mission: Impossible Villains, Ranked!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 10 Mission Impossible Villains</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>10. A.I. The Entity (Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/the-entity-1747682503363.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“A self-aware, self-learning, truth-eating digital parasite infesting all of cyberspace” sounds like a pretty cool threat in any other high-octane thriller, but in the Mission: Impossible franchise it’s only good enough to land at number ten. It underwhelms compared to its human counterparts, because let’s be real – zeroes and ones ain’t got shit and madness and guns – but its power and immense reach are undeniable. The Entity began “life” as a digital weapon designed by the U.S. government before going rogue and hopping through cyberspace with the giddiness of a puppy experiencing its first snowfall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> While toying with and killing a submarine filled with Russian sailors is an act of murderous cruelty, it’s the Entity’s bigger, broader acts of deception that mark it as a true villain. Its early days of online manipulation saw it shifting public opinion and behavior through social media, and it’s a brutal reminder of events in the real world. We live in a present where people with nefarious agendas are influencing easily shaped minds, and with the increased use of A.I. in our online dealings, it’s not hard to imagine something like the Entity stepping in and really turning our daily lives into a nightmare.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>9. John Musgrave (Mission: Impossible III)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/musgrabe-1747693587438.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Not every villain has direct blood on his hands, but that doesn’t mean they’re any less dangerous. Musgrave is Hunt’s Operations Manager at the IMF, and it’s suggested they may even be minor friends – understandable as he’s played by Billy Crudup, and who wouldn’t want to be friends with Billy Crudup. He brings Hunt in on a mission to rescue one of his proteges, Lindsey Farris, and when that goes wrong and Hunt is blamed for the fallout, it’s Musgrave who helps the agent escape to pursue justice. See? A friend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Surprise! It’s all a ruse, and Musgrave is actually a traitor working with a man named Owen Davian on some elaborate plan to retrieve a piece of tech nicknamed “the rabbit’s foot.” Musgrave’s a hero in his own mind, though, as he’s hoping to use this as motivation for first strikes against enemy forces. He wants the U.S. and the IMF to play a more aggressive role in the fight against terrorism, and if that means supporting terrorists along the way, well, he’s all for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> Musgrave might think his heart is in the right place here, but in addition to enabling a murderous terrorist in Davian, he crosses an equally big line by pulling Ethan’s wife, Julia, into danger. Worse, he lets Davian shoot Julia in the head right in front of Hunt. Sure, she’s revealed to have been a minor henchwoman in a mask, but the emotional damage is real.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>8. Kurt Hendricks (Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/hendricks-1747682536982.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While some villains act out of greed and others cause misery simply for the fun of it, Kurt Hendricks is a man who only wants the best for humanity. What is the best, you ask? Well, in Hendricks’ mind, our species would benefit from something of a cleanse. From the great biblical flood to the atomic bombing of Japanese cities during World War II, immense disasters lead to rebuilding, recovery, and real improvement… apparently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sounds logical, so Hendricks sets out to trigger just such a global debacle starting with a massive attack on the Kremlin in Moscow and leading to the acquisition of nuclear codes. He proves himself to be one of the greatest threats Ethan Hunt has faced to that point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Except, and this is where casting comes into serious play, the film wants us to see him as a physical threat to Hunt – but that’s nearly impossible. Michael Nyqvist was a fantastic actor, and he makes for a compelling villain through dialogue and intent. But a serious contender in a fight with Cruise? It’s difficult to buy, but that doesn’t stop director Brad Bird from letting him go toe to toe with the film’s star for a weirdly long fight. (To be fair, Chad Stahelski started it by letting Nyqvist seemingly hold his own for a bit with Keanu Reeves in John Wick.) So, while Hendricks is a grand threat on the world stage, he tumbles some in the ranking here as an unserious brawler against the highly trained and in far better shape Hunt. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> Like Musgrave above, Hendricks seriously thinks he’s doing the world a favor by causing harm. His final act results in a nuclear missile being fired towards San Francisco, something that would have killed tens of thousands of people immediately before triggering the death of millions more. That’s no small thing, and he would have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn’t been for those meddling IMF agents.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>7. August Walker (Mission: Impossible - Fallout)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/august-walker-1747682556546.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Hunt and his IMF team have been betrayed by double agents and traitors on numerous occasions, but most of them are greedy middle-aged men in suits who don’t pose an immediate physical threat to our intrepid hero. August Walker is something different entirely. He towers over Hunt and is jacked from his mustache on down. Henry Cavill’s portrayal ensures that he’s already menacing even while pretending to be on Hunt’s side, but once the truth comes out, the gloves come off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walker is revealed to be working in cahoots with the brilliant Solomon Lane, and together they frame Hunt and once again pull the love of his life, Julia, into harm’s way. His motivation for it all is a bit over the top and dramatic – he wants the old world to implode and give rise to something better – but what else would you expect from a man who seems to cock his arms like guns during fist fights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> Walker and Lane are planning to detonate nuclear bombs, and while the latter stays behind to die in his greatest act of terror, Walker is on a chopper heading to safety. Hunt, of course, catches up to him in pursuit of the detonator that’s needed to stop the countdown. While Walker could have easily escaped by giving up the detonator, his desire to cause suffering – especially Hunt’s suffering if Julia were to die – leads him to a one-on-one fight to the death with the agent. It’s a decision built on rage and self-righteous justification, and it rightfully ends in his painful demise.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>6. Paris (Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/paris-1747682570825.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to villains in the Mission: Impossible universe, few can touch Pom Klementieff’s Paris on style and charisma points. A henchwoman to Gabriel, she lets her gleefully murderous skillset do most of her talking, and it’s a refreshing change of pace from baddies who seem compelled to share their life stories before pulling a trigger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Her costume and face makeup see her stand apart from the crowd, but don’t let her doll-like appearance fool you. Paris is a merciless fighter who refuses to quit despite the odds, as evidenced by a shootout and car chase in Rome that sees her literally plowing through obstacles both human and otherwise in her pursuit of Hunt. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> While Paris makes mincemeat out of numerous threats, she ultimately succumbs to Hunt during an alleyway brawl. He spares her life, though, and after being punished by Gabriel – he basically tries to kill her – she chooses to betray both him and her villainous tendencies by saving Hunt’s life. Maybe I’m stretching the definition here, but it takes a real badass to turn your back on villainy with the discovery of unexpected morals and a change of heart.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>5. Gabriel (Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/gabriel1-1747693609929.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The mysterious Gabriel arrives in the penultimate entry of the franchise, and he’s a man with deadly skills and an alliance with the Entity. He also comes with a backstory suggesting an integral role in Ethan Hunt’s life. It seems Gabriel killed a woman named Marie thirty years ago, someone Hunt was apparently fond of, and it’s that murder that landed Hunt at the IMF – where he went on to save thousands of lives. Hundreds of thousands, even. So maybe Gabriel is a hero? I kid, I kid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He’s obviously a villain, and he may even be something of a seer (?), but while his late-to-the-party franchise arrival unavoidably undercuts his dramatic weight, the character’s casting lifts Gabriel right back up again. Esai Morales brings real charm and a calm menace to the character, and it’s immediately made clear that he’s not someone to be trifled with. You believe both his physical abilities and deadly intentions, and Morales’ added dramatic weight makes him a real threat to Hunt. He also earns a bump in the rankings by gifting viewers with the best, most unforgettable villain death in the entire franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> Gabriel’s killed a lot of people, and he even destroyed a rolling Agatha Christie landmark, so it’s clear he’s a bad guy. His most vicious act, though, comes as a bookend to having “fridged” Marie three decades earlier. Gabriel threatens to do it again by killing either Ilsa or Grace – Hunt’s current love interest or the woman who just landed in his lap mere hours ago – and while the film wants to trick viewers into thinking it’s going to be the latter, it’s Ilsa who dies by Gabriel’s blade instead. McQuarrie and Cruise are obviously the real villains here for introducing this tired trope of a woman’s death being responsible for a man’s life, but it’s ultimately Gabriel who thrusts the knife into Ilsa’s gut. It could have been Grace who died. Hell, it should have been Benji. Instead, Gabriel extinguishes the franchise’s brightest flame this side of Hunt himself. J’accuse!</p><div data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="article-subtitle">Not yet available for streaming.</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>4. Jim Phelps (Mission: Impossible)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/jim-phelps-1747682606048.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Jim Phelps wasn’t the only friend/fellow agent to betray Hunt over the years, but he was the first – and arguably the most shocking. The character, as played by Peter Graves, was the IMF’s lead agent for the bulk of the television series’ seven-season run from 1966 to 1973. He was unquestionably a good guy, so there was no reason to suspect that his presence in the first Mission: Impossible film would be anything different – well, Jon Voight in the role was probably a clue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Audiences expected Phelps to essentially hand the reins over to Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt, but while he did just that, he did so with a major act of betrayal. As he tells Hunt once his ruse is discovered, the end of the Cold War threatens to end the need for the IMF – this is as naive a statement as ever uttered in the entirety of the franchise – and he was worried about becoming a relic barely scraping by on sixty-two thousand dollars a year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> The betrayal itself is already brutal as Phelps turns his back on friends and agents who’ve risked their lives together over the years, but it’s the specifics of his traitorous act that hits hardest. In his effort to frame someone else for his crime, Phelps kills off three members of his team during an operation and then fakes his own death. What could have been a simple theft, instead becomes an act of cruelty making his betrayal sting even more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>3. Sean Ambrose (Mission: Impossible II)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/sean-ambrose-1747682623040.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“That was always the hardest part of having to portray you,” says ex-IMF agent Sean Ambrose to a beaten and angered Ethan Hunt, “grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.” That line alone makes Ambrose a top villain as it’s a terrific zing at both Hunt and Cruise himself. He’s equally dismissive of women as evidenced by his comment that they’re like monkeys when it comes to the men in their lives, that they “won’t let go of one branch until they get a grip on the next.” Say what you will about his greedy desires, but Ambrose (Dougray Scott) understands the assignment when it comes to being a charismatic villain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That greed has led him to steal a deadly plague with plans to unleash it on whole populations if his demands aren’t met. While cash money is his primary motivator, though, Ambrose also seems fueled by a splash of jealousy towards Hunt. That makes their faceoffs all the more entertaining whether they’re jousting on motorcycles or sharing beatdowns in the sand as only the great John Woo can capture it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> The film opens with Ambrose masquerading as Hunt in order to acquire the Chimera plague, but rather than just kill one man, Ambrose and his team crash an entire passenger jet filled with innocent civilians. Acts of terror would claim higher body counts in later films, but this puts faces to the dead in a far more direct way making it more personal and affecting.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>2. Solomon Lane (Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/solomon-1747693631099.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether due to low pay or poor benefits, the world is seemingly overflowing with ex-government employees ready and willing to betray their nations and jump on the train to villain town. Solomon Lane is one such agent, but he goes a step or three further by helping create an organization called The Syndicate that’s built entirely on those bitter, trigger happy ex-agents. They want to sow chaos and reap financial rewards, and they’ve been doing it for years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lane is introduced killing a young, unarmed female agent right in front of Hunt, and it’s soon revealed that he’s responsible for thousands of deaths over the years through events made to look like accidents or the work of wholly unrelated perpetrators. Lane’s history of manipulating trust and the world’s various systems makes him one of the most dangerous villains in the franchise. He’s ahead of Hunt at every step, and his mantra – “The greater the suffering, the greater the peace.” – marks him as a man willing to do anything to accomplish his goals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While many actors go big playing villains, Sean Harris takes the opposite approach and makes Lane a weasel of a man who you just want to see get beaten senseless. It’s an unusually bold choice that leaves him without a darkly appealing persona or personality – he’s just a very bad man who couldn’t care less about you or your loved ones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> As the rare villain to be an active threat across more than one film, Lane inflicts plenty of pain, suffering, and stress on Hunt and his team. The bulk of his evil acts were committed before Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation even begins, but his cruelest and most personal action unfolds during the followup, Fallout. Along with August Walker, Lane manages to activate two nuclear bombs threatening not only the water supply for billions of people, but also the life of Hunt’s greatest love, Julia. Seeing her in harm’s way is the kind of gut punch that Hunt felt only once before, and it’s clear just how sorry he is that his choices have once again brought her so close to dying.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>1. Owen Davian (Mission: Impossible III)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/owen-1747682651428.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot of competition when it comes to selecting the best villain in the Mission: Impossible franchise, but there was never any doubt who’d land at the top of the heap. Davian doesn’t care about much beyond his own wants and needs, and the film reflects that by never revealing exactly what his end goal is – we know he wants the so-called rabbit’s foot, but what it is and what it does are never made clear. We just know that Davian will cut through anyone and anything to get it, and that makes him an exceptionally dangerous man.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">J.J. Abrams’ Mission: Impossible III is unfairly maligned, but even those underwhelmed by the film itself can’t help but applaud Philip Seymour Hall’s frighteningly effective and highly entertaining portrayal of Davian. His blistering stares, his lightning quick shifts from dead silence to raging outbursts, and his deceptively calm way of threatening everything that Hunt holds dear all work to make him a villain who commands the screen and even steals every scene from Cruise himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There may not be a big, global threat at play here, but Davian is the man who arguably gets closer than any other villain to actually killing Hunt. He injects the agent’s head with an explosive device that gets within seconds of churning Hunt’s brain tissue into ground beef, and he even gets some serious licks in while brawling. You wouldn’t think a Cruise versus Hoffman fight would convince, but the latter’s pure ferocity paired with Hunt’s incapacitation due to the pain in his head makes for a viciously compelling bout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> Davian is a mean bastard who, while still in restraints, coldly threatens to murder Hunt’s fiance Julia. “I’m gonna make her bleed and cry and call out your name”, he says, and it’s one of the few times where Hunt’s legendary control tips into real fear and emotion. Davian later comes close to doing just that after abducting Julia, tying her up, and appearing to shoot her in the head. Hunt’s pain is palpable, and it’s enough to damage his heart to the point that he’d go on to never let someone that close again. Davian has literally halted Hunt’s ability to connect with someone on a deeply personal level, and it’s the kind of attack that bullets and bombs just can’t compete with.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

While you can still find ways to buy them online, it is nearly impossible to find them below their original retail price. So if you find yourself face to face with a LEGO set that really sparks joy, it's best to pick it up before it's gone forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, there are some rare cases when you can still find a set for below MSRP even after it gets retired. One such case is this current discount on the Green Hill Zone LEGO set at Amazon. It isn't much of a discount, but we don't expect it will still be at this price for much longer now that its <a href="https://www.brickeconomy.com/set/21331-1/lego-ideas-sonic-the-hedgehog-green-hill-zone" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">been over five months</a> since it was retired.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">LEGO Sonic The Hedgehog – Green Hill Zone Sale</h2><div catalogid="ca02472e-a4c8-49a8-af2b-9d58c3f5abfc" id="218304"><div id="218304" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Ideas Sonic The Hedgehog – Green Hill Zone</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The LEGO Ideas Green Hill Zone set originally came out back in January 2022, but it wasn't until January of this year that LEGO retired the set. IGN actually <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-sonic-the-hedgehog-green-hill-zone-throwback-16-bit">had the chance to build back in 2022</a> when it first came out three years ago and we loved the build. It's a fun tribute to the iconic video game level from the series and one of our favorite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-sonic-lego-sets">Sonic the Hedgehog LEGO sets</a> and is great for any fan of the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as I can tell, Amazon currently has the lowest possible price on this set if you're looking to buy it new, but Walmart also has it available. Ebay has a few different options on used versions for almost half the price, but you may risk missing pieces if you take that route. Considering it is still discounted, Amazon likely has quite a bit of stock left for this set, but as soon as that starts to dwindle you can expect prices to go up fairly quickly. LEGO is no longer selling this set, so once it's gone you'll only be able to purchase it at a markup unless you get lucky.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Recently Retired LEGO Sets on Amazon</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Once LEGO officially retires a set, they tend to hang around at other retailers for a bit longer. This makes Amazon one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-lego-sets">best places to buy LEGO</a> thanks to their extended inventory of these products. There are a number of other recently retired sets you can currently still purchase right now.

One series I personally recommend that hasn't gotten an anime adaptation (at least not yet) is Kagurabachi. Otherwise, your best bet is <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnbgy?object_uuid=628f438d-4e87-4a6b-9338-2ae0e75a4276&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">scrolling through the full sale</a>, which you can sort by individual series. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Art Books Also Included</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Viz Media also publishes a substantial amount of art books and other physical merchandise. Aside from the standard slate of popular manga, these publications highlight authors like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-junji-ito-manga">Junji Ito</a> and animation giants like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-studio-ghibli-movies">Studio Ghibli</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Do You Need a Crunchyroll Account to Shop the Sale? </strong></h2><div catalogid="ca43b5d5-9f77-4193-8c44-062eab8a5174" id="215876"><div id="215876" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Crunchyroll Premium</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Choose from the Fan, Mega Fan, and Ultimate Fan tiers.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Nope!

Included in its list of festivities are videos that fondly look back at The Witcher 3 as well as special events and unique merch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all starts with the trailer, below, celebrating the series’ monster-hunting protagonist, Geralt, highlighting some of his most memorable moments as fans are treated to actor Doug Cockle’s gravelly delivery. It’s not quite a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv"><u>Witcher 4</u></a> update, but it does do a good job of reminding viewers of what made The Witcher 3 so special in the first place.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Cockle joined <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlRkbwmlNsg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the latest installment in CD Projekt Red’s REDstreams</u></a> to reminisce about the 20 years he’s spent providing his voice for the English version of Geralt while sharing how he helped shape the White Wolf.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking to join in on The Witcher 3’s 10th anniversary celebration, CD Projekt has further outlined its plans to bring <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-announces-concert-tour-for-the-witcher-3-10-year-anniversary"><u>The Witcher concerts</u></a> to fans this summer.
