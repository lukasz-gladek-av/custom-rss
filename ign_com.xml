It’s available for the Assault, Vanguard, and Bulwark classes and is limited to Operations, Space Marine 2’s three-player co-op focused PvE mode.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s there that Space Marine 2 players are teaming up to form a three-pronged Neo-Volkite pistol death stream, rekindling memories of all those moments when the Ghostbusters use their iconic Proton Packs to trap ghosts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Neo-Volkite pistol is unique among Space Marine 2’s armory in that it blasts a heat ray onto enemies, dealing accumulative thermal damage. Focusing on one enemy ramps up the damage until it generates a localized explosion for huge damage to your target and all nearby enemies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have found that while the Neo-Volkite pistol is fun to use, it isn’t that effective especially on harder difficulties where ammo is scarce. At least, that’s the case in isolation. But what happens when all three players use the Neo-Volkite pistol to concentrate three heat rays onto the pesky Terminids? You get satisfying, Ghostbusters-style alien death, that’s what.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Redditor Crimsas demonstrated this in action, showing just how effective three Neo-Volkite pistols all trained on a single, powerful Termanid enemy (in this case a Carnifex) can be brought down to size.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All we now need is a mod that replaces the Neo-Volkite pistol model with an actual Proton Pack and we’ve got Ghostbusters 40k edition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/109-patch-4-5-is-available" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Focus Entertainment has said</u></a> it’s limiting the Neo-Volkite pistol to Operations mode for now “as we continue to experiment with balancing in PvP.” It will be added to Eternal War mode in Space Marine 2’s next major update alongside a new Operations map, a new enemy, and the Dark Angels cosmetics. So, hopefully it won’t be long before even PvP is filled with a spot of Ghostbusters action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Saber Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 had “changed everything” for the company</u></a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-spot-chapter-all-but-confirmed-to-get-cosmetic-pack-after-the-dark-angels"><u>Eagle-eyed fans have spotted the Space Marine chapter now all-but confirmed to get a cosmetic pack after the Dark Angels</u></a>, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1grt0ik/neovolkite_my_beloved/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Crimsas / reddit</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The patch added a number of visual features that were exclusive to the mobile versions, pleasing disgruntled fans of the groundbreaking open-world games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition, a compilation of 2001’s Grand Theft Auto 3, 2002’s Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and 2004’s Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, sparked a backlash upon its 2021 launch on PC and console. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-review"><u>GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition review</u></a> returned a 5/10. We said: “GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition is defective, disappointing, and surprisingly disrespectful to three classic games and their many legions of fans.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition was developed by Grove Street Games, which at the time came under fire for the poor quality of the release. The mobile versions were developed by Video Games Deluxe, the Australian studio behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/la-noire-the-vr-case-files"><u>L.A. Noire VR Case Files</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After this week’s update went live, users noticed Grove Street Games and its logo were removed from GTA Trilogy’s main menu and splash screen. Now, the PC and console versions align with the mobile versions, showing Rockstar as GTA’s developer.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Looks like mentions of Grove Street Games and their logos have been removed from the splash screen and main menu of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GTA</a> Definitive Editions as well. <a href="https://t.co/ZmXpccyiyS" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ZmXpccyiyS</a></p>— TJGM (@TJGM_) <a href="https://twitter.com/TJGM_/status/1856316469954453783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 12, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It’s this removal that Thomas Williamson, boss of Grove Street Games, has clearly reacted to in a thinly-veiled tweet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Speaking entire hypothetically: it's a dick move to remove primary developers from credits in an update, especially when an update includes hundreds of fixes that were provided by those developers that stayed out of players' hands for years,” Williamson <a href="https://x.com/TSWilliamson/status/1857124999045222581" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Williamson’s displeasure at recent events is clear, Grove Street Games and Williamson himself remain in GTA Trilogy’s end credits, as many X/Twitter users have pointed out.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">PSA: Rumours being circulated by the community and even some news websites about Grove Street Games (GSG) having been removed from the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTATrilogy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GTATrilogy</a> entirely are unfounded. <br>Both GSG and Video Games Deluxe are in the final credits, only the initial splash screen was removed. <a href="https://t.co/MUkvgi2uZX" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/MUkvgi2uZX</a></p>— GTANet (@GTANet) <a href="https://twitter.com/GTANet/status/1857075030808461543?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 14, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a messy end for GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition, which has endured controversy ever since it came out. Rockstar was forced to apologize for the state of the collection at launch and even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-trilogy-free-game"><u>offered PC players free games</u></a> as recompense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the collection appeared to have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-remastered-trilogy-10-million-units-technical-issues"><u>sold very well despite the problems,</u></a> and Strauss Zelnick – CEO of Rockstar parent company Take-Two – eventually <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-gta-trilogy-launch-problems-glitch-been-resolved"><u>called those issues a “glitch” that was “resolved.</u></a><u>”</u></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/youll-be-able-to-buy-obsidians-rpg-avowed-with-world-of-warcraft-gold-13-million-gold-at-todays-prices<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has announced its launch plans for Obsidian’s RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, including a surprise release on Blizzard’s Battle.net.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Avowed’s release date is set for February 18, 2025, across Xbox Series X and S, the Xbox app on Windows, Steam, and Battle.net. As a first-party Microsoft game, Avowed launches day one on Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the Battle.net launch that’s of most interest here, because it means you’ll be able to buy the game with World of Warcraft gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s how it works: WoW Tokens can be exchanged for Battle.net Balance, not just game time, which means players can indirectly buy anything Blizzard sells for real-world money with in-game gold. Players can buy a WoW Token from Blizzard for $20 and either keep it for later or put it on the in-game auction house. Another player will (hopefully) buy that token from the auction house for in-game gold, then exchange it for $15 of Battle.net Balance (Blizzard effectively takes a $5 tax from the transaction). Battle.net Balance can then be used to buy anything Blizzard sells for World of Warcraft for real-world money, including video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of this article’s publication, a WoW Token is going for 262,365 gold (the price fluctuates as demand rises and falls). At its cheapest, Avowed costs $69.99, which means you’ll need five WoW Tokens to exchange for enough Battle.net Balance to buy the game. That equates to 1.3 million gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a lot of gold most players probably don’t have lying around. But with Avowed three months from launch, there is time to get that WoW gold grind going, if you’re determined to buy the game without actually buying the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, it’s worth noting that Microsoft is selling up to five days of early access to Avowed via the Premium Edition, which costs $89.99 and also includes two premium skin packs and access to the digital artbook and soundtrack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It then spotted a Reddit user called Archbox (Archbox was a moderator of r/SwitchPirates). Based on their posts, the law firm was able to identify Archbox as James Williams. Williams, it turns out, had various Nintendo accounts associated with email addresses, which were tied to repair orders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Williams, an alleged Switch pirate, actually made two repair orders with Nintendo tied to a Surprise, Arizona shipping address.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, cease-and-desists followed — one of which came just two days after Nintendo sent him one of his repaired items. The pirate shops Archbox was allegedly involved with include Jack-in-the-Shop, Turtle in the Shop, and NekoDrive, which all shut down following a cease-and-desist Nintendo sent in March.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Defendant became a leading (if not the primary) moderator of the SwitchPirates Reddit community, which he helped grow to nearly 190,000 members," Nintendo’s initial complaint reads, as reported by <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-modded-hardware-and-r-switchpirates-moderator-archbox-240701/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Torrent Freak</a>. "Since 2019, Defendant has posted thousands of comments and messages to the SwitchPirates Reddit Group.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Defendant’s posts have included, by way of example, messages directing users to the Pirate Shops […]; and offering technical advice and encouragement to other users about how to use the Pirate Shops, how to download and install Circumvention Software, and how to play pirated copies of Nintendo Switch games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo now has a default judgment in their favor after Williams failed to plead his case to the court in time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
