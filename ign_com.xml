Included with an ammo chest of new features, weapons, and more content was the return of the fan-favorite skate-themed map, Grind. The skatepark arena has been brought back mostly as fans remember it, with one exception being a giant, in-game TV screen featuring a very Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater-looking logo and a date of March 4, 2025.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Looks like a teaser for something related to Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater has been found in Black Ops 6‚Äôs Grind MP map!</p><p>Announcement on March 4. üëÄ <a href="https://t.co/8efl6Qansl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/8efl6Qansl</a></p></div>‚Äî CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It stops short of being in-your-face but is still undeniably an eyebrow-raising reference for fans who have been on the lookout for another entry in the Pro Skater series. Rumors that another installment could soon be announced began earlier this week when fellow skater Tyshawn Jones let it slip that he would soon be featured in an upcoming Tony Hawk video game (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-skater-claims-hes-in-a-new-tony-hawk-remaster-about-to-come-out/#google_vignette" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a Tony Hawk coming out, so that‚Äôs cool,‚Äù Jones said during a conversation on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3umK3xG7Ly4&amp;t=1s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Breakfast Club podcast</u></a>. ‚ÄúThey got a new one they remastering so that‚Äôs about to come out. I was in the last one.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a curious comment that had fans excited, with today‚Äôs newly revealed Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater Black Ops 6 Easter Egg letting them know when they can expect to learn more. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no telling what exactly that March date has in store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision tried to breathe life into the franchise with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5">Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater 5</a> back in 2015 but has yet to release another new numbered entry since. However, in 2020, fans received the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2">Pro Skater 1 + 2 remakes</a> from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-developer-vicarious-visions-blizzard-entertainment">Vicarious Visions</a>. That means it‚Äôs been five years since a Tony Hawk game hit store shelves. With so much evidence lining up for a big reveal next month, it seems the wait may soon be over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to see what that March 4 reveal has lined up, you can read up on a few of the other skateboarding-themed inclusions in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 2 Reloaded, including a pack of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activisions-costly-call-of-duty-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-crossover-has-some-players-saying-black-ops-6-should-just-go-free-to-play-at-this-point">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle cosmetics that have some fans upset</a>. You can also see Tony Hawk himself confirm that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawk-teases-pro-skater-anniversary-plans-it-will-be-something-the-fans-will-truly-appreciate">he was working with Actvision again as of last year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
