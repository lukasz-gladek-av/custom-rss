            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-5-tv-show-vs-game-comparison<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The following article contains </em><em><strong>spoilers</strong></em><em> for The Last of Us season 2, episode 5.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ellie’s descent into violence truly kicks off in this week’s episode of The Last of Us. The show’s fifth chapter sees her brutally assault Nora in the spore-infested basement of the WLF’s hospital base. It’s one of the game’s most recognisable scenes and remains similarly harrowing in HBO’s adaptation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This and three other key sequences from the original game were adapted for this episode. Here we’ve compared them against the original source material, analysing what’s changed and what’s stayed the same. You can see both versions in the video above, or read on below for our written explanations.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Seattle Day 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/12/last-of-us-ep-5-comp-guitar-1747046641492.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In both the game and the show Dina listens in on WLF radio chatter to work out the group’s location and patrol patterns. In the game, we see Dina explain all this to Ellie – in part because it helps establish the objectives of the upcoming level. In the show, Dina takes notes but there is no like-for-like conversation about what the WLF codes mean. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in the theater, Ellie explores the auditorium and finds a guitar. It’s one of the more memorable scenes from the game – Ellie takes a seat in the front row and begins to play. In the show, Ellie instead sits on a stool up on the stage. Both versions play the opening of Pearl Jam’s Future Days, although Ellie in the game sings the first two lines – show Ellie sings just the first. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the game, Day 2 sees Ellie head out to Hillcrest. That section of the game is pretty much cut entirely from the show – there’s no hiding from dogs in overgrown houses – but we do get a version of the Seraphite mural that is seen shortly after Ellie leaves the theater. In the game, the “Feel Her Love” graffiti is on the back of a truck. In the show, a similar image is painted on a wall. The WLF have left dead Seraphites below it as some kind of ironic gesture. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Stalkers</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/12/last-of-us-ep-5-comp-stalker-1747046657037.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the episode, Ellie and Dina have a tense encounter with a group of Stalkers. While Ellie does come across Stalkers on Day 2 in the game, this scene isn’t a direct translation of that moment. For one, Dina is now with Ellie – in the game, Dina stays at the cinema. The location has also changed; Ellie was attacked in an office building in the game, where the show’s Stalker showdown takes place in a warehouse. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More significantly, though, the show’s Stalkers behave in a very different manner to their game counterparts. In the game, Stalkers are cautious, almost skittish predators, and so this encounter is a tense game of cat-and-mouse as you try to spot where they are hiding. While the show has made suggestion that Stalkers are more intelligent than the more animalistic Runner variants, in this scene there’s little evidence of that. The Stalkers pretty much just charge – or, indeed, run – at Ellie and Dina, and attempt to break into the cage the duo have barricaded themselves inside of.     </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another change comes with the reintroduction of Jesse into this section of the story. In the game, towards the end of the Hillcrest section, Jesse emerges from the shadows to catch Ellie before she walks into a WLF patrol. In the show, Jesse turns up to help Ellie and Dina escape from the Stalkers. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Seraphites</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/12/last-of-us-ep-5-comp-seraphite-1747046680529.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While much of what players will remember of Hillcrest has been removed for the show’s version of events, memories of the game will very much be evoked by the group’s encounter with the Seraphites. The forest and foliage is very similar to Part 2’s environment, and the sequence in which a hanging man is killed by his Seraphite captors is very close to the events of the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The key difference here is in the people present. In the game, Ellie explores this area on her own, whereas in the show she is accompanied by Dina and Jesse. This directly impacts a key moment when a Seraphite fires a bow and arrow; in the game, the arrow strikes Ellie and she is forced to wrench it from her shoulder. In the show, it is Dina who is shot, the arrow hitting her leg. This forces the group to move on, carrying Dina to safety.    </p><h2 data-cy="title2">St. Mary’s Hospital</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/12/last-of-us-ep-5-comp-ellie-1747046698648.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This episode's big, climactic event takes place in St. Mary’s Hospital. It's the sequence that most closely resembles the video game – a near 1:1 recreation of Nora's final minutes. Like the game, Ellie finds Nora in the WLF-occupied hospital and holds her at gunpoint, demanding to know where Abby is. Their exchange culminates in Nora saying that Joel got what he deserves, her wording in the show closely resembling the script of the game. She then makes a run for it, throwing a container of liquid at Ellie to momentarily stun her. That last detail is slightly different to the game, in which Nora just throws a steel tray that only catches Ellie off guard for a second. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The chase through the hospital is similar to that in the game, although notably shorter and less game-y. Nora shouts for her allies to shoot and they do so from a balcony, replicating the gunfire that sparks around Ellie as you push her forward in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The chase finally ends in the same spore-filled corridor bathed in red light that we saw in the game. Nora, collapsed and breathing in fatal spores, finally realises who Ellie is. “You’re her,” she says in both versions of the story. In the show, Ellie then takes a single swing with a metal pipe and the show cuts to black. In the game, Nora’s death is much, much more violent - with the camera lingering on Ellie’s twisted face, she strikes Nora three times. While this shot isn’t used for the show, HBO does somewhat replicate it a minute earlier by holding the camera on Ellie’s face as she holds Nora at gunpoint. It’s not as viscerally powerful as the shot from the game, but you can see where the inspiration comes from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from The Last of Us, check out our spoiler-free season two review and our spoiler-filled review of the fifth episode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/virtua-fighter-6s-new-look-wolf-hawkfield-has-more-than-a-whiff-of-ganondorf-about-him-and-impressive-muscle-jiggle-physics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has revealed another playable character for its upcoming new Virtua Fighter game: Wolf Hawkfield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wolf is a Canadian professional wrestler of Native American descent who debuted in the original Virtua Fighter game in 1993 and has appeared as a playable character in every installment in the series since. His inclusion in the upcoming new Virtua Fighter comes as no surprise, but what has raised eyebrows is his new look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new Wolf looks a lot older than his previous versions, and, as many fans have pointed out, he also looks a bit like Ganondorf, the main villain from The Legend of Zelda games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega’s announcement video shows Wolf’s walk-out scene, which fans are joking offers more story than he’s ever had before in a Virtua Fighter game before. The announcer’s intro touches on Wolf’s dramatic return to the world of fighting after his “controversial retirement that shocked the world.” Perhaps this new Virtua Fighter will offer a proper, fleshed out story mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video lacks gameplay, but it does show just how detailed the character models are even now, seemingly years away from Virtua Fighter’s release. As Wolf walks out we see quite noticeable muscle jiggle physics at play. Clearly, Wolf has kept himself in good shape over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter 6, as it’s being called by fans in lieu of an official title, is in development at Yakuza / Like a Dragon studio Ryo Ga Gotoku and is without a release window or target platforms. Virtua Fighter hasn’t seen a mainline release in years, leaving mini-game appearances in Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s Yakuza games and the 2021 release of Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown to tide fans over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/virtua-fighter-fans-hope-the-new-game-comes-close-to-matching-this-incredible-in-engine-concept-video">Sega released what it called a “pre-development concept video” for Virtua Fighter 6</a>, but made clear it does not reflect how the upcoming fighting game will look and play when it eventually comes out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The video, shown during Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote speech at CES 2025, features incredibly realistic and fluid animations for a fighting game. We see an Akira mirror match with the kind of combat usually reserved for a martial arts movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter, which includes characters such as Akira Yuki, Pai Chan, and Wolf Hawkfield, is on the hardcore end of the fighting game spectrum, with slower-paced gameplay that challenges players to master its mechanics in order to enjoy success. Virtua Fighter 5, which first released in 2006, is considered one of the greatest fighting games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

This big change means it's likely there will be more codes released in the future, so IGN will keep you covered with all your Grow a Garden code needs!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Working Grow a Garden Codes</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>LUNARGLOW10</strong> - 3 Basic Seed Packs <strong>(NEW)</strong></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Expired Grow a Garden Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Because codes were just added in the latest Lunar Glow update, there are <strong>no expired Grow a Garden codes</strong> for now! Be sure to make the most of the working codes, so you don't miss out on extra seed packs.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Redeem Grow a Garden Codes</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/12/grow-a-garden-codes-1747041583655.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that there's a code redemption system in the Roblox experience, here are the steps you need to follow to use Grow a Garden codes:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Launch the Grow a Garden Roblox experience</li><li>Look in the<strong> top left corner to find the Settings cog </strong>next to the icon of the backpack</li><li>Click settings and scroll down to the bottom</li><li>Copy and paste codes from this article into the Redeem Codes box</li><li>Press claim and enjoy your goodies!</li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Isn't My Grow a Garden Code Working?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are usually two reasons why a code isn't working. It's either because:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The code is expired</li><li>The code has been entered incorrectly</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">If a code has been entered incorrectly or is expired, it will say the "code is invalid." To stop this from happening, we'd recommend <strong>copying and pasting the code directly from this article</strong>. We check and test each of the codes before we add them to our articles. However, when copying them, you can sometimes accidentally include an extra space somwhere, so always double check there's no additional spaces!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Find More Grow a Garden Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If new codes are added to the game, we'll update this article, so you can always check back here and keep up-to-date with the latest codes. Grow a Garden has its own <a href="https://discord.com/invite/gwQvzBS3Ea" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated Discord server</a> where codes will be announced, as well as game updates.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Grow a Garden in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Grow a Garden is a new Roblox experience that's becoming incredibly popular since it launched. The gardening simulator allows players to show off their green fingers, as you buy seeds and plant a variety of crops from basic carrots to exotic dragon fruit trees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As fruit and vegetables finally sprout, you'll be able to harvest them to sell for Sheckles. To go from a beginner gardener to a pro worthy of awards, you'll want your crops to experience mutations that increase their value. This can happen randomly, with Gold and Big mutations being down to chance, while weather events like snow can increase your luck of a Frozen mutation. There's also gear, and even pets now, that can affect how fast your crops grow, their value, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lauren Harper is an Associate Guides Editor.

This is the same editor the developers use internally for all gameplay development. This first release lets modders work with everything from level scenarios to game modes, tinker with AI behavior, abilities and melee combo logic, user interface and HUD elements, and make much of the general modding work with Space Marine 2 faster and easier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Not long ago, I promised we would support the modding scene — and we meant it,” Grigorenko said. “Watching this community grow, push boundaries, and create incredible experiences has been both inspiring and humbling. We’re excited to see what you build next — whether it’s a cinematic campaign, wild new game mode, or something we never saw coming.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To get the ball rolling, Grigorenko released jokey concept art for a "Fishing With Daddy Calgar" mini-game, below, which is technically possible now with these tools. Calgar is Marneus Calgar, the leader of the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/11/fishing-1746999241862.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The race is on to create Space Marine 2's first fishing mini-game mod. Image credit: Saber Interactive / Discord.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To find out what the Space Marine 2 modding community plans to do with this editor, I had a quick chat with Tom, aka <a href="https://ko-fi.com/warhammerworkshop" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Warhammer Workshop</u></a>, the modder behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/massive-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-mod-adds-lore-accurate-classes-a-weapon-previously-locked-to-campaign-and-even-new-operations"><u>Space Marine 2’s excellent Astartes Overhaul</u></a>. Fresh from releasing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-modders-create-12-player-co-op-with-the-developers-blessing-and-now-theyre-working-on-raid-style-missions-with-bosses-that-hit-like-trucks">a mod that enables 12-player co-op in Space Marine 2</a>, Tom told me that he now has access to all the scripting tools that control what happens in any particular mission, as well as for all the different game components like weapons and abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means modders could, for example, create a Space Marine 2 roguelite mode where modders spawn in one of the swarm sequences from the campaign with nothing but a combat knife, and progressively spawn bigger and tougher enemies, with percentage chances to spawn weapons, ammo, and health on death. “Killing a Carnifex might grant you a Heavy Bolter,” Tom suggested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for a brand new cinematic campaign, Tom said that while a Chaos campaign would “definitely” be doable, cutscenes are trickier because modders so far do not have access to the animation tools necessary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Tom is currently planning on adding new factions to Space Marine 2, including the Tau and Necrons, as the modders have the rigs that will fit those. Meanwhile, the Space Marine 2 modding community is racing to actually make the Fishing With Daddy Calgar mini-game mod Grigorenko challenged them to.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction from Space Marine 2 fans is hugely positive, and with good reason. While Space Marine 2 is well-received and has gone down as one of the best-selling Warhammer video games of all time, it is relatively limited in terms of its official offering. That is to say, it contains three factions only: Space Marines, Chaos (a mix of Chaos Marines and some Tzeentch Daemons), and the Tyrannids. Players had hoped for DLC that might extend the faction roster (the Space Marine 2 campaign teased the Necrons), but can now take matters into their own hands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is how you keep a game alive for years like Skyrim,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1kjgnix/comment/mrn2sq9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Mortwight</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a particularly interesting development in the context of Saber and publisher Focus Entertainment’s announcement that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 is in development</a>. Some Space Marine 2 fans have expressed concern about what this means for potential DLC, although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-moves-to-set-the-record-straight-insists-its-not-abandoning-the-game-following-space-marine-3-announcement">both Saber and Focus have insisted they’re not abandoning the game</a>. Still, Space Marine 2 is in a much better position now modders have the editor in hand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
