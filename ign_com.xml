            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I never included or referenced any Witcher Gryffindors or Slytherins again."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Andrezj Sapkowski, the creator of The Witcher, has said he regrets including a throwaway reference to "Witcher schools" in one of his books, which CD Projekt's The Witcher video games have since massively expanded on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Writing in a Q&amp;A on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1nuhirk/asynchronous_ama_andrzej_sapkowski_answers/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, Sapkowski said his single mention of a "School of the Wolf" in The Last Wish, a short story collection, had been an "unworthy" inclusion that he was now considering deleting from the book's future print runs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But for many fans of The Witcher, who know the franchise from its existing trilogy of video games, Witcher schools are now an important part of the franchise — and something that CD Projekt has developed into a key part of its lore. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt has established that there are at least seven guild-like Schools: the Wolf (to which hero Geralt belongs), the Cat, Griffin, Bear, Viper, Manticore and Crane. Those within each school wear a medallion showing them as such — and indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-4-story-fan-theories-ciri-vesemir">the studio's first teaser for The Witcher 4</a> sparked huge speculation among fans with its focus on a new school medallion, which CD Projekt later confirmed was for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-dev-confirms-teaser-is-a-brand-new-witcher-school">previously-unknown School of the Lynx</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while video game fans have enjoyed the series sorting Witchers into Hogwarts-like houses, it's safe to say that Sapkowski isn't on board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A single sentence about some 'School of the Wolf' mysteriously made its way into The Last Wish," Sapkowski wrote. "I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot. Therefore, later I never included or referenced any Witcher Gryffindors or Slytherins again. Never.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"However, that one sentence was enough. Adaptors, particularly video game people, have clung to the idea with remarkable tenacity and have wonderfully multiplied these 'witcher schools'. Completely unnecessary."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/01/gettyimages-55954766-1759321905908.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Witcher creator Andrezj Sapkowski.

Alternatively, the author suggested he could expand on the matter in a future work — something fans have suggested he might do to deliberately rein in the concept closer to his own personal vision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm still uncertain about what to do with this situation," Sapkowski concluded. "Perhaps, taking the path of least resistance, I’ll erase the sentence about the ‘school’ from future editions of The Last Wish. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Or maybe I’ll want to expand and clarify the matter somehow in subsequent books? Perhaps I’ll shed some light on the issue of Witcher medallions, their significance, and their connection to specific individuals? There are many possibilities, and the sky is the limit."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Witcher 4 Unreal Engine 5 Tech Demo Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sapkowski's comments come alongside the arrival of his latest Witcher novel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-prequel-book-crossroads-of-ravens-where-to-buy">Crossroads of Ravens</a>, in English nearly a year after its debut in Poland.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans think they've uncovered proof that 2009 action game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/prototype">Prototype</a> could be getting a new lease of life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the game has mostly remained dormant on Steam since its release 16 years ago, eagle-eyed fans spotted a flurry of updates behind the scenes via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/10150/subs/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB</u></a>, as well as a revealing datamine effort that has discovered a mysterious change to the game's credits that adds in remaster studio, Iron Galaxy, and a curious reference to Ubisoft Connect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not all, though. "So one of the OG modders for the game data mined the recent update and has found a lot of interesting things," StanleyMitchel explained on the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrototypeGame/comments/1nu2oqp/prototype_remaster_might_just_be_in_the_works/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>subreddit</u></a>. "For Prototype 1, they have added some test maps and quite a few new names in the credits. There might be some hope for a remaster after all."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">They then linked to <a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/WV75q76C/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>two text versions of the game's credit roll</u></a>, which highlights the changes. These include a new "downloadable content" team, another team for "Ubisoft Connect Version," "Activision Localization," "Demonware," and finally, "Iron Galaxy Studios." In all, 753 changes were made to the original credits list. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"One of the new studios in the credits worked in [sic] the Spyro remasters," Nixson wrote on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrototypeGame/comments/1nu2oqp/prototype_remaster_might_just_be_in_the_works/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>. "This is 100% confirmed. They're remastering the games. Likely using the same engine/code or some hybrid like Oblivion. There's a lot of new names in the credits, mainly other Activision studios," they added. "I'm starting to think the new Prototype game in-the-works thing may be true."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the strange Ubisoft Connect reference? Don't forget that when Microsoft acquired Activision as part of its historic $68.7 billion deal in 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-a-complete-timeline-of-events"><u>Microsoft agreed to sell Activision's cloud gaming rights to Ubisoft</u></a>. So while none of this is confirmed, it's possible Prototype is one of the games Ubisoft will be adding to its subscription service. Watch this space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prototype sees you take control of Alex Mercer, a dark, genetically mutated shape-shifter with no memory of his past, hell-bent on solving the mystery of his existence as he tears through New York City. We had a good time with it when it released way back in 2009, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/06/10/prototype-review">calling Prototype</a> a "game with many cool features [but] lack[ing] many of the finishing touches that make for a great and memorable game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
