In worker placement tabletop games, they literally can be. In this form of gameplay, you take your team through different tasks of adventures as you build toward end goals. There are many different worlds you can choose to embark on, or themes to try, depending on the game you choose. This list has some of my latest favorites, including both newer and older worker placement games.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Featured in this article"><strong>TLDR: The Best Board Worker Placement Games to Play Now</strong></h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't need no stinkin' blurbs, you can see all the games in this article in the handy side-scrolling catalog above. If you do want to read about the games, however, just keep on reading.</p><p id="viticulture"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Viticulture">Viticulture</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218898"><div id="218898" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Viticulture</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Viticulture, designed by Jamey Stegmaier of Scythe accolade, is a delightful trip to the region of Tuscany, where families of players take their mama's and papa's inheritance to help them create successful wineries. The game is about building a vineyard, harvesting grapes, bottling nectar, and selling vino. To do so you’ll have to use your workers wisely during the available time in the season. Players play across multiple years, building their wineries and ageing wine to fulfil orders. Gather your friends and raise a glass to Viticulture, which is playable competitively in its original iteration or as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a> in the Viticulture World edition (<a href="https://zdcs.link/z3RNLM?object_uuid=ba4899ce-31d7-4008-9ed2-a48d30df13a2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see at Amazon</a>).</p></div><p id="yokohama"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Yokohama">Yokohama</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218899"><div id="218899" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Yokohama</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yokohama is a board game about doing business in the titular real-life port city near Tokoyo in Japan. In it, players have a team of workers to help them build their business. Enlist a staff to help you strategically gain resources, build technologies, and complete orders to build your trading empire toward optimal success. The game is moderately complicated, but turns go by rather smoothly once you get the hang of it. It can be played with two to four players but <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/196340/yokohama" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board Game Geek</a> says it’s best with three.</p></div><p id="unconscious-mind"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Unconscious Mind">Unconscious Mind</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218900"><div id="218900" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unconscious Mind</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unconscious Mind is a heavy Euro game about psychology and grief. It is also hands down one of the most gorgeous games I own. Gameplay is complex, providing options for layered strategies in movement and timing to best execute moves. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wX6EA?object_uuid=ba4899ce-31d7-4008-9ed2-a48d30df13a2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DWV7PGWK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Nightmares expansion</u></a> also further adds potential complexities to help make the game more challenging or, with some pieces like the fireworks and the gramophone lighter for folks who may want a softer experience. A heads up, however: this game takes a while to get going. You'll need time for setup, time to teach it to your fellow player, and time for the gameplay itself. It’s far more time than the box says, so be prepared for a longer haul time of gaming when you sit down with this.</p></div><p id="wayfarers-of-the-south-tigris"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Wayfarers of The South Tigris">Wayfarers of The South Tigris</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218901"><div id="218901" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wayfarers of The South Tigris</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Wayfarers is a complex but satisfying combination of dice and worker placement game that surprised me with how fun it was it was. The worker placement is connected to dice rolls, giving a bit of a chance to combine actions with workers and decisions, which, when they click, can be rewarding. The game has a lot of decision space to determine your moves. It can seem intimidating at first glance, especially if you're not versed in heavier Euro games. I was first intimidated by this game, and then pleasantly surprised when I finally sat down to play a three-player game of it. While resources are tight, with multiple decisions being key, it provides a lot of replayability. Don’t pass on this game – you’ll miss out on a lot of fun if you do. </p></div><p id="darwins-journey"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Darwin’s Journey">Darwin’s Journey</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218902"><div id="218902" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Darwin’s Journey</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve always wanted to be a scientific explorer like Darwin, you’ll enjoy playing Darwin’s Journey. In it, you race fellow explorers and the legendary Darwin himself across three islands by boat and by land to discover nature and science to put in a museum. This game is easy to navigate and highly repeatable. It’s lovely on the table but also <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=darwinsjourney" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>accessible online</u></a>. It’s worth getting a physical copy of it, though, as it seems to be a big hit with a variety of both seasoned and more casual players.</p></div><p id="fromage"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fromage">Fromage</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218903"><div id="218903" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fromage</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re hungry for a new game that's perfect to share with friends or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-couples">dates</a> (including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo</a> ones), this is a good one, as it literally has food in the title. Fromage is a relaxed simultaneous board game about making and selling award-winning cheeses across France. You build structures, tend to livestock, and fill orders in this quick-to-play board game. Their Italian spin on the game <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/roadtoinfamy/formaggio" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Formaggio</u></a> has my Italian taste buds craving Parmigiano even more, too.</p></div><p id="the-gallerist"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Gallerist">The Gallerist</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218904"><div id="218904" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Gallerist</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">True to its title, The Gallerist is a board game about running an art gallery. In it, you discover artists, display their art, and work toward getting the right snobs – erm, <em>artistic connoisseurs</em>, with exquisite tastes – to be patrons in your gallery. A heads up before you grab a bottle of vino and your cheeseboard to open your shop: this is not a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">beginner-friendly board game</a>. It's one of the most challenging games on this list, ranking at a 4.24 out of 5 complexity on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/125153/the-gallerist" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board Game Geek</a>, so consider yourself warned. I guess you could say that it’s a bit like reality in that the art world can be difficult to get into.   </p></div><p id="septima"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Septima">Septima</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218905"><div id="218905" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Septima</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Some games have art that wows you. As a colorful goth, I found the art in this one extraordinary. Septima is an accessible and user-friendly game that's focused on a theme I enjoy intensely: witches. The game works by building covens, collecting herbs, brewing potions, and, of course, surviving witch hunters and witch trials. I loved it despite the trials and pains of losing allied witches to an angry mob. I highly recommend finding your own coven and playing it yourself. You can also play this one solo if you’d like. Bonus round: there's also an <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gOnEq?object_uuid=ba4899ce-31d7-4008-9ed2-a48d30df13a2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">expansion</a> that includes shapeshifting with animals, adding even more gorgeously designed artwork.</p></div><p id="rock-hard-1977"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rock Hard: 1977">Rock Hard: 1977</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218906"><div id="218906" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Rock Hard: 1977</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rock Hard 1977 is a worker placement game about unleashing your inner rockstar. The game, made by legendary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUn5Pyay6Qs&amp;list=PL0oNLQW4QN2IRQ4SUZP13RwQfms9oGk6A&amp;index=5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rock N Roll</u></a> bassist Jackie Fox of The Runaways, features stunning components that let players rock their way to stardom. The player board is shaped like an amp, paired with your favorite head icon. It was one of Gen Con’s fan favorites. User warning, however: this game has several heavy themes and is not advisable for folks who are not prepared to encounter some very sad content that, while it does happen in the rock star life, is not always groovy to come across if you’re unprepared for it.</p></div><p id="age-of-comics-the-golden-years"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Age of Comics: The Golden Years">Age of Comics: The Golden Years</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218907"><div id="218907" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Age of Comics: The Golden Years</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Chances are that if you are here on IGN, you are like me and love <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/comics"><u>comics</u></a>. Age of Comics: The Golden Years gives you a chance to build a catalogue of comics during the Golden Age. Hire artists, writers, and inkers to help design your book. Race other players on their own publishing journeys to create ideas and publish comics to sell and reach fandom. While the art is full of pulpy goodness, you don’t have to be a comic book fan to enjoy the game. Heck, you don’t even have to have your own original ideas to produce books in the game, either. They sometimes say that you have to fake it until you can make it. In Age of Comics, you can do both if you want to. This one is playable for up to four players but is best with three. Like Septima and some others on the list, you can play it solo if you desire to pull it off the shelf alone. It’s also one of the easiest games on this list to learn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jennifer Stavros is a contributing freelancer for IGN, covering everything from comics, games, technology, and nerd culture.

Hangar 13 President Nick Baynes described Mafia: The Old Country as a "focused, linear experience that combines quality storytelling, authentic era immersion and a refined take on the familiar Mafia gameplay."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: "That focus allows us to deliver a story that’s gritty, grounded, brutal and emotional. Embracing early 1900s era Sicily, this is a mafia origin story that follows our protagonist, Enzo Favara, as he takes the oath and works his way up Don Torrisi's crime family.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mafia: The Old Country May 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tellingly, 2K President David Ismailer added: "We think there’s a large audience for compelling stories that don’t require massive time commitments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’re excited to offer a game like Mafia: The Old Country in our portfolio, and to provide a linear highly-polished narrative experience that can easily complement the other more persistent games our players also love and engage with on a more consistent basis.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on these comments, Mafia: The Old Country will be a relatively short affair. There is no multiplayer mode, so the story is the entire package.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps that’s why the standard edition costs $49.99 across all platforms, and the deluxe edition costs $59.99. Here’s the breakdown, per 2K:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mafia: The Old Country will offer two editions: Standard Edition and Deluxe Edition. Both editions are available for pre-order today and will release worldwide on August 8, 2025.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Standard Edition includes the full base game and will be available for $49.99 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam.</li><li>The Deluxe Edition lets players descend into Sicily's criminal underworld in true Cosa Nostra style with a variety of bonus items and will be available for $59.99 on PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam. This edition includes the Padrino Pack, featuring "Lupara Speciale" Shotgun, "Vendetti Speciale" Pistol, "Immortale" Charm, "Padrino" Outfit, "Stiletto Speciale" Knife, "Eckhart Speciale" Limousine and "Cosimo" Horse and Accessories. Additionally, it offers the Gatto Nero Pack with the "Bodeo Nero" Pistol, "Velocità" Charm, "Gatto Nero" Racing Outfit and "Carozella Nero" Race Car, plus digital bonus materials including the Original Score and Digital Artbook full of concept art and developer notes.</li><li>Pre-order Mafia: The Old Country Standard Edition or Deluxe Edition to receive the Soldato Pack featuring the "Soldato" Outfit, "Scannaturi Speciale" Knife, "Tesoro" Horse and Accessories and "Lupara" Charm.</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-compare-mafia-the-old-country-to-gta-6-dev-says-theyre-not-as-similar-as-youd-think">IGN interviewed Baynes and game director Alex Cox about all things Mafia: The Old Country</a>, and the prospect of running up against GTA 6. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">With GTA 6’s delay from fall 2025 to May 26, 2026</a>, that is of course no longer a concern.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the interview, the pair dismissed comparisons to GTA 6, insisting Mafia: The Old Country shouldn’t be considered an open-world game at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rather, the pair insisted, Mafia: The Old Country is more like Mafia 1 and 2 than it is the open-world Mafia 3. It is a “linear, narrative-driven” game, a “focused package” that offers a “cinematic experience.” You might find yourself driving around an authentic representation of 1900s Sicily in Mafia: The Old Country, or even riding around on horseback a bit like that other Rockstar game, but the similarities to Rockstar games stop there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
