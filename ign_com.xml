Everything that we have talked about is still in development. We will share information on upcoming games when we have something cool to share.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most obvious subject of Willits’ statement is the KOTOR remake, which remains one of gaming’s most elusive projects. Announced in 2021, the long-awaited remake has changed hands multiple times, seemingly stopped development and restarted again, and after four years has failed to materialize.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In April 2024, Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-says-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well">the company took KOTOR with it during its split from Embracer Group</a>, and that the game was still in active development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's clear and it's obvious that we're working on this," he said at the time. "It's been in the press numerous times. What I will say is that the game is alive and well, and we're dedicated to making sure we exceed consumer expectations."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Willits’ statement, which comes nearly 12 months later, reaffirms Karch’s quote. But still, even now, we have seen nothing of the KOTOR remake beyond its initial announcement video.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Saber also has other games in the works, including a number due out this year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/john-carpenters-toxic-commando">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/jurassic-park-survival">Jurassic Park Survival</a> are still down for 2025, but neither has a release date. Saber is also working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/turok-returning-as-a-co-op-dinosaur-hunting-action-game-and-ditching-first-person-the-game-awards-2024">a brand new Turok game</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-is-getting-a-aaa-rpg-with-saber-interactive-and-paramount-game-studios-exclusive">an untitled Avatar: The Last Airbender title</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, you can add Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 to the list.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-confirms-changes-to-much-loathed-trading-system-are-coming-eventually<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Save your shinedust, everyone.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> have finally offered specific details on major improvements coming to the game's much-loathed trading function, which has been an absolute mess since launch. And the improvements sound genuinely great, but it's going to take forever for them to be implemented.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://community.pokemon.com/en-us/discussion/17262/trading-feature-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post to the Pokémon community forums</a>, the developers explained the upcoming changes. We're listing them here as written:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest change here is that TCG Pocket will remove the currency that's currently being used for trading: Trade Tokens. Trade Tokens were added to the game specifically to be used with trading, and frankly, they suck. They're absolutely necessary in order to trade at all, but the only way to get them is by effectively vaporizing cards you already own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-trading-today-and-players-absolutely-hate-it">We explained it in more detail here</a>, but the tl;dr is that as things currently stand, if you want to trade one ex Pokémon for a friend's ex Pokémon, you need to throw five other ex cards in the bin first to get enough trade tokens to trade the one you want. And your friend has to do the same. While there have been a few other ways to get bonus trade tokens since then, the system overall has remained extremely discouraging for anyone who actually wants to use it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new system, on paper, is much better. Shinedust is a currency that already exists in game and is currently used to purchase "flairs" for cards — little animations to make them sparkle in specific ways when you use them in matches. You collect shinedust automatically whenever you get duplicates of cards you already have, and more shinedust is available from events and other methods. Unless you're big on flairs, you probably have a lot of it just sitting around already, and the TCG Pocket devs say they're looking into ways to give you even more to ensure trades can happen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And for what it's worth, it is important for TCG Pocket to impose <em>some</em> cost to trading. Otherwise players could game the system by making tons of new accounts, opening the numerous packs handed out to players early in the game, and just trade all their new rares to their main accounts. Then rinse and repeat. Imposing a cost ensures that people are trading thoughtfully — the trade token system was just way, <em>way</em> too expensive for your average player to ever bother.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's one more big change listed here that will make a massive difference: the feature that will allow players to share cards they're interested in trading. As things currently stand, you can put a card up for trade, but there's no way to tell anyone what cards you might want for it unless you call up your friends outside of the game and tell them. Everyone else just has to guess. As a result, most players aren't even bothering to try and trade with strangers. But if we can offer some clue as to what an acceptable trade would be, players can make reasonable offers and actually use the system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1jarxix/we_can_use_shine_dust_instead_of_trade_tokens/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the community seems pretty happy with these changes</a>, and early responses are positive. There is one massive drawback, which is that players have already thrown away tons of rare cards just to collect the existing trading currency, and there's really no way to get that back. Even though existing trade tokens will be converting to shinedust, the cards are still gone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there's one other issue: we're going to have to wait months before any of this takes effect. The blog post suggests these changes won't be implemented until fall of this year. In the meantime, it's likely that trading will grind to a total halt, since the current system is terrible and no one is going to want to nuke their rare cards to do it if a better solution is on the way. We're likely to go through several more expansions before the "trading" in "Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket" really takes off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Save that shinedust, I guess!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/preview-pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-journey-together-a-return-to-form-for-fans-of-trainers-pok%C3%A9mon.1134861/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together</a> drops on March 28, 2025, bringing back a mechanic we haven’t seen since 2004. Trainer’s Pokémon are making a comeback, just like the classics from EX Team Magma vs. Team Aqua, and I couldn’t be more excited to preview this set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This set focuses on four iconic Trainers: N, Iono, Lillie, and Hop, each getting Pokémon ex that showcase the strong bonds they share with their teams. If you’ve ever wanted a deck where N’s Zoroark ex, Lillie’s Clefairy ex, or Iono’s Bellibolt ex take center stage, now’s your chance.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>My Journey Together Product Openings</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-26-1741958136456.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With over 180 cards, there’s plenty to chase. The set includes 40+ Trainer’s Pokémon, 16 Pokémon ex, 11 Illustration Rares, six Special Illustration Rares, and three Hyper Rare gold cards. Box Toppers are also making a return, with Enhanced Booster Display Boxes featuring a stamped N’s Reshiram Illustration Rare.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Journey Together Standard Booster Box</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Opening a Booster Box is pure chaos in the best way. With 36 packs, the sheer volume makes every pull really exciting. My highlights include N’s Reshiram Illustration Rare, Iono’s Bellibolt ex Secret Rare, and a Hyper Rare Spiky Energy. Those were some seriously exciting moments, but even outside of the big hits, I pulled tons of solid ex cards that are going straight into my decks.
</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-27-1741958396837.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The one card I wanted most, Hop’s Zacian ex, didn’t show up. Lillie’s Clefairy ex Special Art Rare? Also missing, but that’s just how Booster Boxes go. You get a ton of chances, but nothing is guaranteed. That said, this was still the best way to experience the set. If you love opening packs or just want a massive injection of cards into your collection, a Booster Box is always a good time. Check out all the rare pulls further down. This box was absolutely worth it for me.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Elite Trainer Boxes always feel more premium than just grabbing loose packs. Right away, the N’s Zorua promo caught my eye, and the box itself is perfect for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trading-card-storage-ideas">storing cards</a>. The sleeves, dice, and condition markers are great for anyone who plays the game, and with nine booster packs, there’s still plenty of room for some good pulls.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-28-1741958539804.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I wasn’t expecting anything too crazy with only nine packs, but I still walked away with Iono’s Kilowattrel Illustration Rare, Articuno Illustration Rare, and a Veluza ex. Some really fun cards that made the opening feel totally worth it. ETBs don’t have the sheer number of hits that a Booster Box does, but there’s something nice about having a structured, all-in-one product like this. If you want a mix of pack-opening fun and collectible extras, this is a great way to experience Journey Together. Check out the full list of rare cards from our preview further down. We ended up with some serious gems.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Journey Together Build &amp; Battle Box</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Build &amp; Battle Boxes are a totally different experience compared to a Booster Box or Elite Trainer Box, but they have their own kind of excitement. The big draw here is the prebuilt 40-card deck, which lets you jump straight into a game without spending time sorting through stacks of cards. I pulled Hop’s Snorlax as my promo, which is actually a pretty great card. Its ability gives all of Hop’s Pokémon a 30-damage boost, making it almost essential to any deck running his lineup.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-29-1741958654728.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those four packs didn’t disappoint. I pulled Mamoswine ex and Swinub Illustration Rare, which couldn’t have fit my deck’s theme better. The limited number of packs means you won’t get as many rare pulls as a Booster Box (unsurprisingly), but if you’re looking for a fast way to start playing with the new set, this is easily the best option. With four different promo cards available, I already want to pick up another box to see which one I get next. Check out my Journey Together preview pulls below to see some of the best cards we got from across all our openings.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Our Pokémon TCG: Journey Together Pulls</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I cracked open 49 booster packs across all our products and ended up with 18 rare cards. Some were exactly what I was hoping for, and others were total surprises. One thing is for sure, trainers will be pulling a lot more rare cards than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review">Prismatic Evolutions</a>. Here’s what I pulled:</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Hop’s Snorlax (Promo 184)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-30-1741958767195.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A bulky Basic Pokémon with 150 HP that boosts all of Hop’s Pokémon attacks by 30 extra damage. This is a great card for any Trainer-themed deck, and while Dynamic Press hits hard, that 80 recoil damage stings. Still, the ability alone makes it a worthwhile addition to any Hop-based strategy.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>N’s Zorua (Promo 189)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-32-1741959195231.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A cute but unremarkable card that exists to evolve into something better. 70 HP and 20 damage from Scratch won’t turn any heads, but if Zoroark ex is strong in this set, Zorua will have its moment.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Spiky Energy Hyper Rare (190/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-33-1741959293367.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">An instant staple in my decks. It deals 20 damage every time the Pokémon it’s attached to gets hit, making it both offensive and defensive at the same time. Oh, and it provides Colorless Energy too. Absolute win.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Iono’s Bellibolt ex-Secret Rare (172/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-34-1741959499324.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A 280 HP Lightning-type beast with Energy acceleration for days. Its Electric Streamer ability lets you attach unlimited Lightning Energy to Iono’s Pokémon, making it an instant engine for Lightning decks. Thunderous Bolt’s 230 damage is great, even if it does mean skipping a turn. This one’s going to see play.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Iris’s Fighting Spirit Full Art (180/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-35-1741959606543.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A risk-reward draw Supporter that lets you discard one card and draw until you have six. This is a great way to refresh your hand, especially in decks that benefit from discarding Energy or Pokémon. It’s a full art, too, which makes it even sweeter.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Iono’s Kilowattrel Illustration Rare (163/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-36-1741959698372.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A Lightning-type support Pokémon that lets you refill your hand with its Flashing Draw ability. The catch? You have to discard a Lightning Energy first. Mach Bolt’s 70 damage is average, but this bird is more about hand advantage than brute force.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>N’s Reshiram Illustration Rare (167/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-37-1741959814425.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A 130 HP Dragon-type that becomes more dangerous the more damage it takes. Powerful Rage can rack up serious numbers, while Virtuous Flame’s 170 damage is solid but a little Energy-intensive. If you like high-risk, high-reward plays, this one’s for you.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Articuno Illustration Rare (161/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-38-1741959891188.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A Water-type setup Pokémon that can accelerate two Basic Water Energy onto itself with Frigid Fluttering. That’s useful for getting it battle-ready fast, and Ice Blast’s 110 damage is respectable. This is a great starting piece for any Water deck.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Swinub Illustration Rare (165/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-39-1741959990211.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This adorable little guy is actually really useful early-game. Call for Family lets you search your deck for two Basic Pokémon, which is huge for setup. Lunge Out’s 10 damage is laughable, but let’s be real, Swinub isn’t here to attack.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Salamence ex Secret Rare (177/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-40-1741960077687.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This 320 HP Dragon-type monster does two things really well — spread damage and hit like a truck. Wide Blast deals 50 damage to every Benched Pokémon, and Dragon Impact slams for 300 damage, but you have to discard two Energy. Absolute beast.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Hop’s Zacian ex (111/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-31-1741959055767.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A Steel-type legendary with a brutal 240-damage attack. The downside? Brave Slash can’t be used twice in a row, which means you need a switching strategy. Insta-Strike does a little spread damage, but Zacian is here to knock things out in one hit.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Alcremie ex (075/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-41-1741960162418.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A support-heavy Psychic Pokémon that heals 30 damage every turn thanks to its Confectionary Gift ability. Whipped Shot’s 160 damage is solid, but this card is best used as a sustain option in control decks.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Mimikyu ex (069/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-42-1741960253913.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A tricky Pokémon that loves spreading damage. Mischievous Hands puts three damage counters on two of your opponent’s Pokémon, setting up knockouts later. Ghostly Trip deals 120 damage and Confuses the Active Pokémon, which is a great way to disrupt their plays.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Veluza ex (043/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-43-1741960335962.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A Water-type glass cannon that can hit for 240 damage — if you’re willing to discard your whole hand. Purging Strike is high-risk, high-reward, and Razor Fin’s 30 damage is barely worth mentioning. This card is all-in or nothing.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Lillie’s Clefairy ex (056/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-44-1741960440336.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A Psychic-type that punishes Dragon decks with its Fairy Zone ability, which makes all Dragon Pokémon weak to Psychic. Full Moon Rondo scales its damage based on both players’ Bench size, making it a potential late-game sweeper.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Volcanion ex (031/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-45-1741960586672.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A Fire-type bruiser that burns the opponent’s Active Pokémon just by being in play, thanks to its Scalding Steam ability.Scorching Cyclone’s 160 damage is great, and moving an Energy to a Benched Pokémon makes it even better.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Mamoswine ex (079/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-46-1741960688002.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">An absolute tank at 340 HP that can search your deck for any Pokémon once per turn with Mammoth Hauler. Rumbling March starts at 180 damage but scales up if you have more Stage 2 Pokémon on your Bench, which makes it terrifying in evolution-heavy decks.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Salamence ex (114/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-47-1741960777849.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the second Salamence ex I pulled, and I’m not complaining.
