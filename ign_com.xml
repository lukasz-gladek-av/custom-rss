            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">22 years after it began, the Call of Duty video game series is finally getting a Hollywood movie, thanks to a deal between Activision and Paramount.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both companies issued a joint statement in which they said the partnership “aims to bring the iconic Call of Duty universe to life on the big screen, delivering an unforgettable cinematic event for fans worldwide.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately we know nothing of the movie itself, except it’s a live-action feature film. There’s no release window, director attached, or cast.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty fans have for years wondered why the game hasn’t had an official adaptation, considering Hollywood’s love of war movies. Call of Duty itself is one of the biggest video game franchises of all time, with over 500 million copies sold globally. A movie would benefit from launching into an established audience and instant brand recognition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb from today’s announcement:</p><blockquote>Under this milestone partnership, Paramount will develop, produce, and distribute a live-action feature film based on Call of Duty, designed to thrill its massive global fan base by delivering on the hallmarks of what fans love about the iconic series, while boldly expanding the franchise to entirely new audiences. Both companies are committed to honoring the brand’s rich narrative and distinctive style, promising an authentic and exciting experience for longtime fans and newcomers alike.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 10 Call of Duty Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s a quote from David Ellison, Chairman and CEO of Paramount, who said he’s a big Call of Duty fan who’s put “countless” hours into the franchise over the years:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a lifelong fan of Call of Duty this is truly a dream come true. From the first Allied campaigns in the original Call of Duty, through Modern Warfare and Black Ops, I’ve spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love. Being entrusted by Activision and players worldwide to bring this extraordinary storytelling universe to the big screen is both an honor and a responsibility that we don’t take lightly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence that guided our work on Top Gun: Maverick, ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve. I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand — thrilling longtime fans of Call of Duty while captivating a whole new generation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s an additional comment from Rob Kostich, President of Activision: “Throughout its history, Call of Duty has captured our imagination with incredible action and intense stories that have brought millions of people together from around the world, and that focus on making incredible Call of Duty games remains unwavering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With Paramount, we have found a fantastic partner who we will work with to take that visceral, breathtaking action to the big screen in a defining cinematic moment. The film will honor and expand upon what has made this franchise great in the first place, and we cannot wait to get started. Our shared goal is quite simple — to create an unforgettable blockbuster movie experience that our community loves, and one that also excites and inspires new fans of the franchise.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paramount has form when it comes to successfully adapting video games. Its hugely popular Sonic movies have proved critical and commercial hits, but it’s worth noting Paramount also made the Halo TV series, which was canceled after Season 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And let’s remember that all we have now is news of a partnership. Hollywood is littered with the bodies of adaptations that were announced but failed to become a reality for whatever reason. This is an important first step, and perhaps the most promising first step a Call of Duty movie has ever had, but this is far from the end of the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, it's fun to speculate about what the Call of Duty movie might look like. Will it go down the OG Call of Duty route and tell a World War 2 story? Or will it pick one of the stories already established by the Modern Warfare or Black Ops sub-brands? If so, will we see popular characters such as Price, Ghost, and Soap, or Mason, Woods, and Hudson? If we see those characters, which actors will play them? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Call of Duty movie news comes ahead of the crucial launch of Black Ops 7, which launches this November amid what is expected to be stiff competition from rival first-person shooter Battlefield 6. To that end, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-battlefield-6s-commitment-to-gritty-realism-activision-makes-shock-call-of-duty-change-for-black-ops-7-we-hear-the-feedback">Activision has U-turned on goofy skins for Black Ops 7’s launch, and will not feature a carry forward option for cosmetics</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
