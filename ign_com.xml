            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/every-noteworthy-character-in-gta-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A who's who of Vice City.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar may have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">delayed Grand Theft Auto 6 to May 26, 2026</a>, but the studio has surprised everybody with a new trailer loaded with story and character details. While we knew from the first trailer that GTA 6 would feature two protagonists, it mostly set the stage for a return to Vice City. But with the newest trailer, Vice City gets a little more full thanks to a bevy of new faces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While their full roles and personalities might still be a mystery, the new trailer and the updated official GTA 6 website shares just enough that we now have a rough outline of who some of these friendly faces are. So read on for every GTA 6 character we’ve seen so far.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Every Important GTA 6 Character We’ve Seen So Far</strong></h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Jason Duval</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/jason-duval-04-1746540363699.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Jason Duval. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first protagonist in our Bonnie and Clyde duo is Jason Duval, a man who’s looking for the easy life but can’t seem to catch a break. After serving time in the Army, he’s in the Leonida Keys working odd jobs for the local drug runners. The only thing keeping him going is his love for Lucia.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Lucia Caminos</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/lucia-caminos-06-1746540461266.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lucia Caminos. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the start of the trailer, we meet Lucia just as she’s released from Leonida Penitentiary, having served time after fighting for her family. We know her father taught Lucia how to fight from a young age and that their family moved to Leonida from Liberty City (GTA’s version of New York City). With Jason by her side, it seems Lucia has a plan to give both of them a new start towards a better life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like past GTA games, GTA 6 is led by a couple of streetwise toughs hoping to find the score of a lifetime. What’s unique is that unlike the trio from GTA 5, and the lone wolves of older GTA games, Jason and Lucia seem to genuinely love each other, and that might allow them to reach new heights – or fall even harder than past main characters.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Brian Heder</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/brian-heder-03-1746540941114.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Brian Heder. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Brian is Jason’s landlord and one of the aforementioned local drug runners in Leonida. By day he runs and operates Brian’s Boat Works and Marina, but this serves as a legitimate front for his drug business for which he hires Jason to act as some additional muscle. He sounds suspiciously like the actor Stephen Root, but Rockstar isn’t sharing its voice cast for GTA 6 just yet (we asked).</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Cal Hampton</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/cal-hampton-03-1746540562480.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Cal Hampton. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Jason’s friend and drinking buddy at The Rusty Anchor, Cal is described as having “casual paranoia” and seems somewhat prone to conspiracy theories… but also having a good time, so maybe it all balances out for him? If Rockstar’s penchant for American satire continues, we can expect Cal to exhibit some of the worst, if funniest, parts of Leonidian society.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Boobie Ike</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/boobie-ike-01-1746540641301.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Boobie Ike. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A local Vice City legend, Boobie Ike is now a legitimate entrepreneur and business mogul, a far cry from his life on the streets. Boobie runs everything from real estate, a strip club, and even a recording studio which he is using as a launch pad for a new music empire with his associate, Dre’Quan. Keep an eye out for Only Raw Records’ first hit.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Dre’Quan Priest</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/drequan-priest-02-1746540704532.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dre'Quan Priest. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Boobie, Dre’Quan is a businessman whose primary job is gangster and drug dealer. He’s hoping to use his partnership with Boobie Ike and the talents of his first music signing, Real Dimez, to promote himself to the Vice City elites. It remains to be seen how much of Dre’Quan’s ambitions will end up helping or hurting him in his climb up the power ladder.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Real Dimez</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/real-dimez-04-1746540816790.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Real Dimez. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Musical duo Real Dimez comprises Bae-Luxe and Roxy, high school friends who turned their street toughness into a hip-hop and social media career. They’ve signed on with Dre’Quan Priest and Boobie Ike to capitalize on the success of their first hit, DWNPLY, to become Only Raw Records’ breakout stars.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Raul Bautista</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/raul-bautista-04-1746540887820.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Raul Bautista. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It wouldn’t be Grand Theft Auto without a few criminal masterminds, and Vice City’s got theirs with Raul Bautista. A veteran bank robber, his tendency to up the stakes during a heist means that his crew often has to deal with more than they planned for. Maybe one of his best-laid plans will be something Jason and Lucia sign on for to get their big break?</p><h3 data-cy="title3">And More (Various Gangsters, Cop in Body Armor, Influencers)</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/ambrosia-03-1746541721202.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Leonida Man and Woman. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of faces that get a brief appearance in the trailer who aren't named. From various gangsters who Lucia and Jason seem to have run-ins with, to, of course, cops looking to bring down Vice City's criminals. And in between are all manner of partying influences, gun store owners, and other Leonida denizens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the main characters we know about so far in GTA 6. Has anyone caught your eye yet? How do you think the two protagonists will stack up to past GTA anti-heroes?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-time-wrestling-all-or-nothing-board-game-review.1182696/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/all-time-wrestling-all-or-nothing-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pile drivers, clotheslines, and – time travel? In the board game All Time Wrestling: All or Nothing, an immensely wealthy wrestling fan from the future uses the power of time travel to bring together some of the most iconic wrestlers from the past, present, and future to compete against one another. The game, designed by Mohamed Al Qadi and Jad Yammine and published by Cation Arts, offers players a fun time, whether or not you're familiar with pro wrestling and its pantheon of characters.</p><div catalogid="d55f387f-9d55-466a-a73e-98f67d3532b9" id="218897"><div id="218897" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>All Time Wrestling: All or Nothing Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyone who grew up in the ‘90s like I did knows the WWF (as it was called back then, before the World Wildlife Fund won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE#Lawsuit_and_renaming_(2002)" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trademark dispute</a>) was all the rage among kids. So, while I opted to get my spandex fix with Power Rangers, I still had enough folks in my circle to know who the Macho Man and the British Bulldog were. While ATW’s subject matter may not be a big selling point for me, its balancing act of managing your resources and knowing when to push your luck kept me coming back round after round.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In ATW, much like in actual wrestling, players attempt to exhaust and weaken each other, with the end goal being to pin their opponent and take home the win. Each selectable wrestler – including legends like Macho Man Randy Savage and the British Bulldog, alongside ATW original characters – features unique abilities and varying levels of health and stamina, which adds some lovely variety to the game and helps keep matches exciting from one to the next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat plays out with the player holding “initiative” playing cards from their hand and rolling dice to deal damage. Successful hits push the Momentum Track in that player’s favor, replicating the crowd hyping up the wrestler. The higher the momentum, the easier it becomes to land hits and gain other bonuses, which incentivizes continued aggression. Initiative only switches when an attack misses, the defender blocks, the defender uses their once-per-game “Reversal” ability (which instantly stops the combat), or the attacker voluntarily passes to regain some stamina and cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between the different attack bonuses and the ability to combo cards together, there is a pleasant amount of depth and strategy in ATW without being overly complex. What I found most interesting, though, is how <em>initiative</em> is handled – it's done in a way I haven’t encountered in other games before. I really enjoyed this “press your luck” approach, and it made managing my hand of cards, stamina, and momentum more exciting. It often left me with a tough choice: do I push hard and risk leaving myself in rough shape for a chance to cinch a pin, or do I pass and forfeit the attack to try and weather the next assault, hoping I’ll be in a better position to strike back?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of cards, this is perhaps where my biggest issue with ATW lies. Instead of relying on text, the game heavily uses symbols and icons to denote things like damage, stamina requirements, special attributes, and other modifiers. As a general rule of thumb, if a game <em>can</em> employ icons, it should – so long as they are both readable and not overwhelming. Luckily, I never found there to be too many icons to decode in ATW, but the readability leaves a lot to be desired.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The action cards, which you use the most, feature colorful artwork of various wrestlers performing everything from jabs and punches to German suplexes and signature moves. However, this can make picking up on all the symbols more of a hassle than it should be – especially if you're on the receiving end and viewing them upside down or from a distance. More than a few times I encountered situations where finishers or dice modifiers were missed, or cards were mistaken for others, due to duplicate artwork being used for attacks with different stats. Perhaps it’s because of my long history with games like Magic: The Gathering, but I wish the information was presented atop a slightly opaque background, rather than directly over the art. It’s not a finisher on the game, but it’s certainly a bit of a jab to the chin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The core game box offers players plenty of value and flexibility, providing not only standard 1v1 matches but also a tag-team-based 2v2 mode, a cage match variant with new rules, and a solo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign</a> mode that lets you improve your wrestler as you progress. The automated systems in solo mode are fine, but admittedly, as someone who has never quite gotten into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board games</a>, I spent far more time playing against others than diving into ATW’s campaign.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I personally prefer the more intense, head-to-head two-player experience.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for tag mode, the inclusion of specialty partner abilities and the ability to tag in my friend to continue combos added an extra layer of choice and strategy. Still, it didn’t quite hit as hard as the core 1v1 mode. Even with the new tag mechanic, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this mode simply adds more players at the expense of having more downtime, since only one attacker and one defender are active at any given time, with partners outside the ring. It’s still fun and led to some awesome team-up moments with friends, but I personally prefer the more intense, head-to-head two-player experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those wanting to dive even deeper into the All Time Wrestling universe, the creators continue to release new expansions – fully compatible with existing content – that add legends like Sgt. Slaughter and the Junkyard Dog, alongside new game modes like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four-player</a> free-for-alls and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-three-player-board-games">three-player</a>-specific Triple Threat matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All Time Wrestling is one of those games worth checking out even if the wrestling theme doesn’t grab you. With games clocking in at under 30 minutes for two players and around 45 minutes for tag teams, it's a great filler during game nights or something compact enough to take to a bar. I’d love to see this system adapted for other themes – like a shonen anime (think Dragon Ball Z) or something Power Rangers-inspired. There’s a surprising amount of depth here, while still being approachable for players of varying board game experience – even those coming to it purely for a love of wrestling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With All Time Wrestling, Cation Arts delivers a dramatic and faithful representation of the wild history of wrestling in a package that will delight fans of head-to-head games, regardless of whether you know what a DDT stands for or not.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aX2mge?object_uuid=1d3f2b21-42ca-46ea-a29d-eca2d1e54d62&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1e3g?object_uuid=1d3f2b21-42ca-46ea-a29d-eca2d1e54d62&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Cation Arts</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJpeE?object_uuid=1d3f2b21-42ca-46ea-a29d-eca2d1e54d62&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at The Wrestling Collection</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 6, 2025 7:15 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">All Time Wrestling is one of those games worth checking out even if the wrestling theme doesn’t grab you.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6s-delay-just-affected-the-entire-video-game-industry">Rockstar taketh away</a>, but Rockstar also provides. Well, it provides a tiny little bit. Grand Theft Auto 6 may have been delayed to May 2026, but today we finally got a second trailer. It’s a big one, too, with almost three minutes of footage that delves deeper into the world and story that we’ll finally be able to experience next year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve combed through the whole trailer with the finest of fine toothcombs to collect all the important details, from the biggest story reveals to the tiniest tidbits. So let’s get on with it: here are 89 details from the new GTA 6 trailer. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Every Detail We Found in the New GTA 6 Trailer</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">1. As revealed in the trailer’s description, GTA 6 will follow the story of Jason and Lucia, a couple who find themselves in the middle of a criminal conspiracy after an easy score goes wrong. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">2. Our first protagonist is Jason Duval, a dude just looking for an easy life in a world that keeps making things harder. He had a troubled youth, something he attempted to escape by joining the army, but his dark past keeps catching up with him. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">3. These days, it seems like he’s working in sales and services for the Leonida Marine Centre, as seen on the white t-shirt he’s wearing in a couple of scenes. But we also know, thanks to information from the newly-updated GTA website, that he’s working for local drug runners, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">4. Jason falls in love with Lucia Caminos, our second protagonist. She’s recently served a stint in the Leonida Penitentiary, but now that she’s out she plans to build a better life for herself. A life with Jason. And probably a lot of guns, drugs, and explosions, if prior GTA games are anything to go by. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">5. Early in the trailer we’re introduced to Jason’s landlord, an old geezer called Brian. Brian, or Mr. Heder to you, is a longtime drug runner, smuggling product through the Leonida Keys. He does this via his very legitimate boat business, Brian’s Boat Works and Marina, which we see later on in the trailer.   </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/brian-heder-03-1746540941114.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">6. The shots-enthusiast spotted at The Rusty Anchor bar is Cal Hampton, friend to Jason and associate to Brian. He’s got something of a paranoia problem, so maybe take everything he says with a grain of salt. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">7. The woman wearing a gold chain with the letters BL as a pendant is Bae-Luxe, one half of Real Dimez, a couple of high school friends turned rappers and influencers. Along with Roxy and a new record deal with Only Raw Records, she’s hoping to hit the big time in Vice City. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">8. Real Dimez’ manager is Dre’Quan, a hustler more interested in the music business than the city’s criminal underworld. Now he has a potentially big hit on his hands, his days booking acts at the Jack of Hearts strip club are hopefully over. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">9. Talking of the strip club, it’s owned by Boobie Ike, a local Vice City legend. Boobie can only be glimpsed on the GTA 6 website, which reveals that he and Dre’Quan are working together, using drug and club money to fund a budding music empire. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">10. Finally, the eighth major character we’ve been introduced to in this latest information drop is Raul Bautista. Like Boobie Ike, we don’t actually see Raul in the trailer itself, but the GTA 6 website reveals that he is a charming and cunning bank robber who works with Lucia on a score. He’s a reckless operator, so expect things to go very, very wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">11. As the game’s synopsis reveals, Jason and Lucia’s story begins with a score going wrong. We may well be seeing that job in action during a scene in the trailer in which Jason and Lucia rob the Sinfrontera National Bank wearing skull bandanas over their faces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">12. We see Jason goes to pick Lucia up from the Leonida Penitentiary. She’s wearing her electronic ankle tag as she leaves the prison, which we first saw on the game’s key art, and she can be seen wearing it in several other shots. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Lucia Caminos Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">13. It seems that as a condition of her release, Lucia may have to do several hours of community service. We see her wearing a Leonida Department of Corrections orange hi-vis vest in a couple of scenes, including one where she’s picking up trash. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">14. With Lucia now free, the couple are looking forward to a new life. There’s a lot of talk about “new beginnings” and new starts. What could possibly go wrong? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">15. While girlfriends have been part of GTA for a long time now, this seems like the first time we’ll be experiencing a relationship with significant depth. Lucia and Jason seem very, very into each other. Yeah, there’s a hell of a lot of “getting to know each other” going on in this trailer.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">16. The duo will certainly be getting to know the ins and outs of Vice City’s crime scene, too. That time on the inside certainly doesn’t seem to have put Lucia off a few less-than-legal activities. Later in the trailer we can see her blowing up a cop car, and that certainly seems like a fast-pass ticket back to jail to me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">17. Talking of cops, it seems like one of GTA 6’s plot threads will follow a group of corrupt police officers. We see a group of cops who talk about “protecting each other” - but what could be their dirty secret they want to keep protected? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">18. We see that group investigating a filthy building - they could well be the same cops we saw in the bodycam footage from the first trailer, which featured a similarly distressed looking building. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">19. If Raul’s involvement didn’t give it away, it seems like robberies and heists will once again be a key part of the story. Later in the trailer we see a truck dragging a massive box, suggesting that there will be some dangerous escapes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">20. While pretty much everything we see in this trailer is taken from cutscenes, there are a few suggestions of things that could be gameplay features. Early on we see Jason stealing from a store, taking money from the register, and so it could mean that holding up stores is back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">21. There seems to be a lot of animals in this trailer - we see a cat in a store, a doberman dog out in the street, and a snake in Jason and Lucia’s home. Could there be a pet system? It would certainly be something to spend all the money we steal on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">22. We also see Lucia taking part in some kind of cage match. Could there be an underground fighting ring activity available somewhere in Vice City? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">23. Jason can be seen benchpressing weights down at the beach – is San Andreas’ famous workout system making a return? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">24. There’s also a new screenshot that shows Lucia in the gym. With GTA 6 very clearly going all-in on immersion when it comes to graphics, it wouldn’t be surprising to see that ambition translate to gameplay via a lot of old GTA lifestyle minigames returning in new guises. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">25. Regardless of if you can workout or not, Lucia will want to flex her muscles when an incredibly muscular woman attacks her in a plane undercarriage during what looks like a Mission: Impossible grade setpiece. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">26. As you’d expect of GTA, it also appears that several sports minigames will be available across Vice City. Revealed in a new selection of screenshots are mini golf, </p><p data-cy="paragraph">27. Pool,</p><p data-cy="paragraph">28. Fishing, </p><p data-cy="paragraph">29. Basket ball,</p><p data-cy="paragraph">30. Kayaking, </p><p data-cy="paragraph">31. Scuba diving, </p><p data-cy="paragraph">32. And dirt bike racing. It seems like there won’t be a shortage of things to do outside of the main missions. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">33. It might not be just outside activities, either. In Jason's house we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-has-an-easy-to-miss-fake-ps5-and-fans-are-joking-rockstar-has-leaked-the-ps6">can clearly see a video games console</a>, complete with PS4-style controller and a PS5-like main unit. Could we hang out at home and play a few games? It would be pretty cool to play GTA: Vice City in Vice City… </p><p data-cy="paragraph">34. Of course, we won’t want to stay inside for too long. There’s a huge open world to explore, and we now know more about the key locations we’ll be visiting on the GTA 6 map. First up, of course, we have Vice City itself. The GTA 6 website says, “We're a long way from the '80s, but Vice City is still the sun and fun capital of America. The glamour, hustle, and greed of America captured in a single city. Each neighborhood has something to offer, from the pastel art deco hotels and bright white sands of Ocean Beach, to the bustling panaderías of Little Cuba and the bootleg brands of the Tisha-Wocka flea market, out to the VC Port, the cruise ship capital of the world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">35. We also know a little more about some specific establishments in the city. We get a new look at the Nine1Nine Vice City club, as seen in the last trailer. In trailer 1, there was a plane that had a large banner in tow that read ‘Nine1Nine Vice City - Why Sixty Nine when you can Nine One Nine?’. This is likely a riff on Miami’s real E11ELEVEN nightclub. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">36. We also get a look at Vice City’s sports scene - we see a man wearing a Manatees Jersey, its colour undoubtedly a riff on the turquoise of the real-life Miami Dolphins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">37. And we can also just see the bottom of the logo on his cap, which seems to belong to a basketball team. Luckily, a screenshot of Vice City’s Sahara Arena lets us know that they are called the Narcos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">38. The screenshots also give us a look at the modernised Ocean View Hotel, its neighbouring Ocean Beach, and the sign outside of Vice City Airport.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">39. Another large area is Leonidas Keys, based on the Florida Keys. The Rockstar website says that, “The dress code is casual, the bars are loaded. Life in this tropical archipelago isn’t flashy but it’s easy. Get your buzz on and pull up a deck chair but look out — you are right on the doorstep of some of the most beautiful and dangerous waters in all of America."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Leonida Keys Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">40. This is where we think we’ll find Brian’s Boat Works and Marina, presumably the front for Brian’s drug-running operations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">41. One location we see shown heavily in the trailer is The Rusty Anchor, where both Lucia and Jason enjoy a few drinks with Cal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">42. Speaking of drinks… quite a few returning beer brands are making their way to GTA 6. Those spotted in the trailer include Pisswasser,</p><p data-cy="paragraph">43. Stronzo,</p><p data-cy="paragraph">44. Pindayho,</p><p data-cy="paragraph">45. Patriot,</p><p data-cy="paragraph">46. and Logger Beer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">47. AND, although it isn’t seen at The Rusty Anchor, we do see a couple of Lavazas Beers, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">48. As Jason and Lucia leave the bar, we catch a glimpse of a concert poster for The Hummers and The Strummers. They’re playing The Rusty Anchor on August 24th. Maybe we’ll get to catch them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">49. And finally in The Rusty Anchor, we see a piece of wood commemorating Hurricane Roxy. Does this hint at extreme weather being a part of GTA 6’s world? It would certainly be the natural evolution of Red Dead Redemption 2’s incredible storms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">50. A couple more screenshots of the Leonidas Keys here show us what other wildlife to expect in the area. These include lizards, mobility scooter grannies and, temptingly, what looks like the ability to scuba dive with turtles. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Grassrivers Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">51. Next up, we have Grassrivers, GTA 6’s wetlands area. Described by Rockstar as “the untamable jewel of Leonida’s crown. You never know what lies beneath the surface of this primordial expanse. The gators may be the most famous attraction, but there are far deadlier predators and weirder discoveries among the mangroves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">52. We get a glimpse of this location at the end of this new trailer as Jason pilots a helicopter over the swampland. He appears to be chasing the same hovercraft seen in trailer 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">53. The new screenshots don’t tell us much more about Grassrivers except really reinforce that promise of alligators in this world. We get not only one, two, but three images of gators, including some delightful-looking residents claiming victory over a toothy one.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Port Gellhorn Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">54. Port Gellhorn is Leonidas’ forgotten coast. Full of “Cheap motels, shut-down attractions, and empty strip malls won’t bring the tourists back, but there’s a new economy in this once-popular vacation spot. It’s fueled by malt liquor, painkillers, and truck stop energy drinks. Jump on a dirt bike and hold onto your wallet.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">55. Gellhorn features quite heavily in the trailer. We see Jason and Lucia in an intense car chase here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">56. Lucia sports a Gellhorn International shirt. Does this suggest that the GTA 6 map will have more than one airport?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">57. We also get a good look at the Starlet Motel, which is situated in Port Gellhorn in both the trailer and a sparkly new screenshot. We think this might play quite a big role in GTA 6’s story, and wouldn’t be surprised if it’s where Lucia and Jason make one of their seemingly many mattress rendezvous.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">58. The new batch of screenshots also shows us another Leonidas after-dark spot in the form of Delights Cabaret Club. It looks like we won’t be short of night time entertainment.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Ambrosia Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">59. Seemingly in the middle of GTA 6’s map is Ambrosia. The Rockstar website says, “In the heart of Leonida, American industry and old-school values still reign supreme — whatever the cost. The Allied Crystal sugar refinery provides the jobs, while the local biker gang provides almost everything else.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">60. We saw plenty of people living in Ambrosia chugging beers and enjoying the mud in trailer 1, but almost nothing this time around. What we do have are a handful of new screenshots that give a good look at the Final Chapter biker gang.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">61. We also get a couple of landscape scenes that reinforce that image of industry, as fire and smog fill the air.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Mount Kalaga Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">62. And last up for now on our tour of Leonidas is Mount Kalaga. Found in the northern part of the state, “Mount Kalaga offers prime hunting, fishing, and off-road trails. In the lush surrounding backwoods, hillbilly mystics and paranoid radicals live far from the prying eyes of the government.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">63. Again, we don’t see a ton, if any, of Mount Kalaga in the trailer, but new screenshots do show us some of that wildlife, as big cats appear to be making a return to the series after terrorising so many of us on Mount Chiliad in GTA 5</p><p data-cy="paragraph">64. We also see signs throughout the trailer four other locations that haven’t been detailed by Rockstar yet. These include Southside, Peacock Bay, Mariana County and Vice-Dale County.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">65. The television in Jason and Lucia’s apartment also gives us a look at somewhere we imagine we’ll be visiting one or two branches of quite a bit in GTA 6: Ammu-Nation. Thr TV commercial shows us the new version of Phil Cassidy, a character previously seen in the era of GTA 3 and Vice City. Back then he was the owner of Phil Cassidy's Fully Cocked Gun Shop, but this new version of Phil, finally given a HD makeover, appears to be the owner of GTA’s premier weapons store, Ammu-Nation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">66. Speaking of guns… we also get a sneak peek at the arsenal we might be wielding in the game. Among the boomsticks we'll be using are the welcome return of Shrewsbury Shotguns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">67. And we see Lucia using a grenade launcher to create an explosive pile-up in a police chase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">68. And she also has an SMG in the bank raid. As seen in Phil’s Ammu-Nation commercial, there’ll be many, many guns to fire in GTA 6. But that shouldn’t really come as a surprise, should it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">69. It wouldn’t be GTA without vehicles - it is Grand Theft <em>Auto</em>, after all. You can spot several major car brands across the trailer, starting with a blue El Camino-like Vapid parked outside Jason's house. The Vapid brand has been seen all across GTA’s HD universe, but this appears to be a new model. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">70. Brian also appears to drive a Vapid, this time a large GMC-like truck. This looks to be GTA 6’s version of the Caracara. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">71. Also parked at Jason’s house is a sky blue car that looks like it dropped straight out of the 1950s. With its rear fins and rounded corners, it has more than a passing resemblance to GTA Vice City’s Oceanic.  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Jason Duval Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">72. On a drive through the neighborhood, Jason passes a woman who has a white car with pink paw prints over the hood. The logo in the grille is that of the Maibatsu company, GTA’s equivalent to Mitsubishi. This car actually looks a lot like the Maibatsu Sunrise R, a popular car based on the Mitsubishi Evo that was modded into GTA 5. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">73. Out on the docks, we see a Dinka brand boat. This was a brand we previously saw in GTA 5, and it seems like there’s a new version of the Predator boat: the LurePredator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">74. In the background of the shot featuring Bae-Luxe, we can see a metro train travelling along its rail track. Perhaps this could function as a fast travel system between the game’s major locations? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">75. In the sequence where the crew is stealing the massive box, we can see their score is being dragged by a Bravado Bison four-door pickup truck. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">76. Parked in front of the Dominion Hotel is what looks like an orange Benefactor Schafter and a bright green Pegassi Tempesta. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">77. A Buzzard helicopter can be seen chasing an airboat through the Grassrivers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">78. Here, Jason and Lucia can be seen getting wet and wild on a SeaShark jetski. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">79. And here we can see Jason riding what seems to be a new Western Motorcycle Company bike, with a classic Dodo seaplane flying overhead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">80. A more specific detail here, but when zoomed in you can get a good look at a Liberty City licence plate on this truck. These are inspired by the 2020 era Excelsior New York plates, which makes sense, seeing as Liberty City is based on the Big Apple.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">81. Finally we have an overhead shot of the car we saw Jason and Lucia using in the previous trailer, which seems likely to be GTA 6’s version of the Sabre Turbo. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">82. We can also spot a FlyUS plane high up in the sky, a commercial airline seen throughout the GTA series. Though, we highly doubt we can purchase one like many of the above vehicles, we will no doubt all try to steal one at some point. That is an unwritten rule of GTA.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">83. There are a handful of other tiny details we’d also like to give a shout-out to as well. These include the return of the Zesta soft drink in the convenience store here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">84. And the Redwood Cigarettes stick on the door, if you fancy an even more unhealthy option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">85. If a different flavour of smoke is more your vibe, then maybe you’ll have some use for this 420 card seen in a different store. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">86. And next to it is the phone number: 305-555-0145. The number doesn’t work (we tried), but it is a fun little reference to a joke dialling code seen in movies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">87. This striking mural of the Haitian flag also features what appears to be a message memorialising the people pictured. Translated from Haitian Creole, it reads “In Memory and Love”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">88. And, the song we’re hearing throughout this second trailer for GTA 6 is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-song">Hot Together by The Pointer Sisters</a>, which, incidentally, can also be heard in Mel Brooks’ sci-fi comedy, Spaceballs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">89. Finally, all of this GTA 6 footage was captured on PS5, with the game coming to both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-and-website-still-lists-release-date-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s-with-no-mention-of-pc">PlayStation and Xbox Series X</a> on May 26th, 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Grassrivers Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that was everything we managed to find after taking a good, hard look at the latest GTA 6 trailer. What are some of your favourite details, or maybe you have some madcap theories about what we’ll be able to do in the game? Let us know in the comments!</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
