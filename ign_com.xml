            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tokyo-xtreme-racer-early-access-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokyo Xtreme Racer is a PlayStation 2 game. Now, years of YouTube comments from cynical types who were likely still jostling around inside an ovary at the dawn of the millennium <em>may</em> have taught you that ‘PS2’ is a pejorative – a one-size-fits-all put-down wielded against anything that doesn’t melt the multiprocessors off a graphics card. But it doesn't have to be. The PS2 was an incredible console, brimming with great, approachable games that achieved exactly what they set out to do, were hopelessly addictive, and completely unburdened by microtransactions and live-service malarkey. This succinctly describes Genki’s 2025 Tokyo Xtreme Racer reboot, which recently arrived in early access on Steam: a fantastically moreish blast from the past that’s simple on the surface, steeped in high-speed thrills, and (for now, at least) unapologetically single-player. <em>That’s</em> what makes it a game in the grand style of the PS2 and, for that, I already love it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/07/vlcsnap-2025-02-07-19h19m38s859-1738916412780.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Even the music matches the originals.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For clarity, I’m aware that the overall lineage of this series dates back to 1994’s Shutokou Battle on SNES, and the Tokyo Xtreme Racer name itself can be traced back to the series Dreamcast debut (and sequel) in the US. However, in PAL territories those carried different titles, and that’s why I’m waxing romantic about the PS2: because 2001’s Tokyo Xtreme Racer on Sony’s all-conquering console was my first exposure to the series, and I admire how closely Genki has stuck to its enduring format well over two decades later.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I admire how closely Genki has stuck to its enduring format.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who haven’t had the pleasure, the Tokyo Xtreme Racer series focuses strictly on highway street racing, taking a heavy dose of inspiration from the real-life underground racing scene that peaked on Tokyo’s expressways back in the ’90s. (This was made infamous by the likes of the highly secretive Mid Night Club – an allegedly disbanded racing community still shrouded in mystery today thanks to anonymity amongst its members and its strict, low-profile policies).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After choosing an on-ramp to enter the freeway system (which faithfully recreates Tokyo’s actual Shuto Expressway network) the aim is to cruise and hunt down rival racers to challenge. Races are triggered on the fly by flashing your headlights behind potential rivals, and won unconventionally. There are no finish lines here; instead, their “Spirit Point” bar will drain to empty as they drop further and further behind you, collide with members of the public, or graze the walls. It’s part racing game, part fighting game, and it still works as well as it ever did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wisely, Genki hasn’t tampered with any of this, and it remains the structure of Tokyo Xtreme Racer’s early access revival in 2025. The graphics have received a handsome enough modern makeover but otherwise it’s a staunchly old-school experience. The result is terrific, and I’m hooked once more.</p><div id="rank-japans-most-iconic-car-marques-in-order-of-coolness" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank Japan's most iconic car marques in order of coolness</h3><h3>Rank Japan's most iconic car marques in order of coolness</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Duelling against one opponent at a time and slicing through late-night freeway traffic in a single direction may sound limited and repetitive. In a way, I guess it is. And yet it’s utterly absorbing. Even in early access, Tokyo Xtreme Racer features over 200 named opponents to seek, stalk, and destroy. Some are boss characters that will only emerge after you encounter the rest of their race team members and leave them for dust. Some can only be found and raced under certain circumstances or if you perform specific tasks, the clues for which you can glean from conversations with rivals in parking areas. The writing in these conversations tends to be a bit overwrought (and the story itself leans a little too melodramatic for my tastes) but there <em>is </em>a goofy charm to it I can stomach. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/07/vlcsnap-2025-02-07-19h07m17s149-1738915704979.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">As can this bloke, I suspect.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The difference in difficulty between some of these opponents can be stark at times, so I will say that my experience has been a little uneven. One moment I’ll be beating every buster I find, and the next some mystery hot shot is simply galloping away. Races that are very evenly matched and decided by tactical slipstreaming (or goading your opponent into an obstacle) are the most fun, but they’re a little too uncommon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This has the potential to create the occasional logjam in your progression, because a lot of the upgrade paths are gated behind meeting certain criteria. Needing to beat specific racers in order to earn the ability to purchase better parts might be a sore spot if you’re already spinning your wheels trying to lure out and beat those racers in the first place. It’s a bit of a catch-22, and it’s probably the primary reason I’m not a huge fan of these sorts of roadblocks in racing games. I’m generally of the opinion that, if you have the credits, you should just be able to buy any cars and parts within your means. At any rate, this is the sort of early access feedback that, with any luck, should provide Genki the data to smooth out bumps in its progression road.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Despite the occasional frustrating session, I’m still thoroughly addicted to vanquishing every rival I find.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the occasional frustrating session, I’m still thoroughly addicted to vanquishing every rival I find. Being able to now spot where opponents are on the map (and allowing that to dictate where you enter the expressway) is a sensible, modern touch. Each time you leave the garage represents the start of an in-game night, which concludes when you choose to return to the garage to spend your credits – or simply head straight out again for the next evening. Just <em>one more night</em>, I tell myself for the tenth time before heading back out onto the expressways in search of prey. It’s hard to quit – and not just because the option to actually do so from the garage is buried in a hidden menu I initially had no idea how to reach. You can’t do it from your controller, in case you’re wondering; you have to hit tab on your keyboard.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/07/vlcsnap-2025-02-07-19h15m19s286-1738916510157.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Think of the map as one huge, forking race circuit.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In more ways than just that the menu system does need refinement, as it also lacks quick D-pad support and requires us to use an analogue stick as a mouse. It’d also benefit from some kind of global BACK button shortcut, so returning to the main garage screen from elsewhere – like the tuning menus – wouldn’t require opening the menu bar and manually moving the cursor. Little tweaks like that would significantly sharpen up the process of menu navigation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Car handling, though, already has a slick, arcade feel that’s nicely tuned for smooth steering on a controller at high speed. That said, the chase view does lack the kind of looseness I crave in this sort of racing game, so even minor steering adjustments are amplified to jarring yaws by the time they reach the trailing camera. This feels like something that could be tuned, or potentially supplemented with an additional chase camera that isn’t so stiff. For now, it’s far easier to drive smoothly using bonnet cam.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/07/vlcsnap-2025-02-07-19h13m02s234-1738916001043.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pop up headlights are the best headlights.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The list of cars whose bonnets you can see from there is a good start, and features just under 50 Japanese models at launch. Toyota, Subaru, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Daihatsu, and Suzuki are all in there. (Honda remains conspicuously absent, though.) The cars look fine without being showstopping, but they don’t pick up damage or boast a level of detail as lavish as the vehicles featured in racing genre heavy hitters like Gran Turismo 7. However, the bigger issue at the moment is how they sound. Right now Tokyo Xtreme Racer isn’t so much “extreme” as it is tinny and toothless compared to any one of its arcade racing peers, like Forza Horizon, Need for Speed, or even Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown. It’s the one part of this retro game I wish <em>wasn’t</em> stuck in the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, in broad terms, a lot of the usual suspects are already on these streets. The Mk3 and Mk4 Supra. Five generations of Imprezas. The R32, R33, and R34. The RX-7 and RX-8. The best Evo and the final Evo. There’s certainly plenty of room for it to grow and, looking at the car list for 2003’s Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3, I’m sure I could make some fairly educated guesses regarding what may join the garage. What I will say, however, is I’d love to be more regularly surprised going forward. That is, some Japanese cars that get little to no love in video games would be <em>perfect</em>. Give us a Datsun 620. A 910 Bluebird wagon. Hell, what about a Mazda Roadpacer? I’m sure dropping in a custom four-rotor would solve its acceleration problems. Let’s go <em>nuts</em>.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Tokyo Xtreme Racer is an infectiously addictive time capsule of a racing game that needs little more than a bit of menu refinement and some major aggression injected into its sound to really soup it up and prep it for even more classic Japanese cars to race in and against. In fact, it’s already well worth its early access asking price. It’s narrow in scope, but its highway battle hook makes it hard to put down, and its total lack of modern baggage like microtransactions and tacked-on multiplayer is outright refreshing.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s the first time the long-running sports sim series has skipped a year entirely since it began in 2004.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">UK-based developer Sports Interactive had called FM25 "the biggest technical and visual advancement for the series in a generation." But it has struggled moving to the Unity game engine, with the player experience and interface in particular causing problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The announcement came as part of Sega Sammy Holdings’ latest financial results, which include a writedown of costs associated with the game. The decision was made after “extensive internal discussion and careful consideration” with parent company Sega, Sports Interactive said in a <a href="https://fm25.info/Statement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> to fans. Sega has confirmed to IGN that no roles are impacted by the news.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sports Interactive said there won’t be any <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/football-manager-2024">Football Manager 24</a> update with 2024/25 season data, as it “would divert critical resources away from the development of the next release which requires our full focus.” The developer is currently in discussions with the platform holders and licensors on the possibility of extending its FM24 agreements on subscription services such as Game Pass.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/06/fm25-announce-web-and-social-assets-1200x630-opengraph-1738865080680.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Football Manager 25 is canceled. Image credit: Sports Interactive / Sega.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">FM25 had already suffered two delays before its cancelation, the latest to March 2025. Sports Interactive has now shifted its focus to Football Manager 26, which is expected to release in the usual November slot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For the large numbers of you who pre-ordered FM25, we thank you enormously for your trust and support – we’re very sorry to have let you down,” Sports Interactive said. Refunds are being offered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know this will come as a huge disappointment, especially given that the release date has already moved twice, and you have been eagerly anticipating the first gameplay reveal. We can only apologise for the time it has taken to communicate this decision. Due to stakeholder compliance, including legal and financial regulations, today was the earliest date that we could issue this statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have always prided ourselves on delivering the best value for money games that bring you countless hours of enjoyment, that feel worth every moment and every penny you spend. With the launch of FM25 we set out to create the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation, laying the building blocks for a new era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Due to a variety of challenges that we’ve been open about to date, and many more unforeseen, we currently haven’t achieved what we set out to do in enough areas of the game, despite the phenomenal efforts of our team. Each decision to delay the release was made with the aim of getting the game closer to the desired level but, as we approached critical milestones at the turn of the year, it became unmistakably clear that we would not achieve the standard required, even with the adjusted timeline.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Whilst many areas of the game have hit our targets, the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be. As extensive evaluation has demonstrated, including consumer playtesting, we have clear validation for the new direction of the game and are getting close – however, we’re too far away from the standards you deserve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We could have pressed on, released FM25 in its current state, and fixed things down the line - but that’s not the right thing to do. We were also unwilling to go beyond a March release as it would be too late in the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Through the cancellation, every effort is now focused on ensuring that our next release achieves our goal and hits the quality level we all expect. We will update you on how we are progressing with that as soon as we are able to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thank you for reading, your patience and your continued support. Our full focus now returns to creating a new era for Football Manager.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Right now, Woot! is offering a massive 2024 model <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yXDLJ?object_uuid=8ee95194-8944-4c8a-a85b-b4fd2ebcad92&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">83" Samsung S90D 4K OLED Smart TV</a> for only $2,499.99.

This is an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">excellent TV to pair with your PlayStation 5</a> or Xbox Series X. In fact, this TV could even be a better <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">gaming TV</a> than the LG C4. Although we haven't personally tested it, <a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/samsung/s90d-s90dd-oled-qd-oled" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RTINGS</a> says the S90D is brighter, has a wider color gamut, better color volume, wider viewing angle, and better HDR gradient handling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Woot! is owned by Amazon, so Amazon Prime members get free shipping on this order. If you're not a  Prime member, don't fret, because the shipping cost should only be $6.

The S90C uses Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">OLED technology aside, the Samsung S90D also has all the features you'd want in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-for-gaming">gaming TV</a>. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-high-end-4k-tv">running 4K</a> at 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. The S90D also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode. This is an especially good complement to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-pro-review">Playstation 5 Pro</a> console that was just released.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Holding Out for 2025 OLED TVs?

The S95F, Samsung's flagship model, boasts a new NQ4 AI Gen 3 processor, a faster 165Hz refresh rate, an improved anti-glare coating, and an upgraded QD OLED panel that promises up to 2,000 nits of brightness. The S90F will also feature the Gen 3 processor, 144Hz refresh rate with VRR, and a QD OLED panel with up to 1,300 nits of brightness (for TV models 55" and up). The S85F remains the "budget" OLED TV with a Gen 2 processor.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">AI and Anti-Glare Tech Are the Highlights for Samsung</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside most companies in the industry, Samsung is going all in on AI. Samsung's new tech for 2025 is its "Vision AI", which can recognize the content you're watching, including specifics like the actors or setting, and display relevant personalized commentary in real-time. In addition, more TV models this year will be equipped with AI Upscaling Pro and AI Motion Enhancer Pro which work in tandem to optimize image quality on the fly. Other features include Active Voice Amplier Pro, which uses AI to isolate and enhance voices, AI Optimization, and AI Energy Mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Samsung is also decisively moving many of its TV panels to the matte-like anti-glare coating we saw on the S95D in 2024. This tech doesn't desaturate like we typically see with anti-glare coatings from other brands, and yet reflections are minimized to the point that you'll never notice them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more options, check out our picks for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-for-gaming">the best gaming TVs</a>.

The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lg-g4-4k-oled-tv-review">LG G-series TVs</a> are even better, but they command a huge price premium. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
