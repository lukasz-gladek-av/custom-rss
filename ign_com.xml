In a level that looks straight out of the series' history, Banjo the bear jumps, glides, rolls and gets shot out of a cannon as he explores and hunts down collectibles. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Eupholace | William Butkevicius (@Eupholace) <a href="https://twitter.com/Eupholace/status/1996263228205080843?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most impressive is the range of transformations on offer, with Banjo turned into a hulking rock golem, cutlass-wielding pirate, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally launched on the N64 in the late '90s, Banjo-Kazooie eventually arrived for Xbox 360 in 2008 following Microsoft's acquisition of developer Rare. But despite earning a legion of fans, the franchise has not seen an all-new entry in 17 years, since Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts released for Xbox 360, also back in 2008.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite repeated calls from fans for a new Banjo-Kazooie to be made, Xbox has made no suggestion that a fresh title is in development — and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rare-has-plotted-out-the-next-five-years-of-sea-of-thieves">Rare now seems singularly focused on making fresh content for Sea of Theives</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You've seen from our history that we haven't touched every franchise that people would love us to touch — Banjo fans, I hear you," Microsoft's gaming boss Phil Spencer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-shouts-out-banjo-kazooie-while-talking-about-bringing-back-older-franchises">said back in 2023</a>. "But it is true that, when we find the right team, and the right opportunity, I love going back to revisit stories and characters that we've seen previously."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of being playable in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Banjo and Kazooie now feel largely forgotten. Still, fans of the duo have still had the spiritual successor Yooka-Laylee to enjoy. Developed by various members of the original Banjo-Kazooie team, the game recently got a polished-up re-release in the shape of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Laylee: Replayee</a>, which arrived in October of this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
