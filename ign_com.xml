Even so, it’s such a quantum leap over the original PSVR in terms of ease of use, visual quality, and immersion that any PlayStation owner who loves VR should upgrade as soon as possible."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Its 4K HDR OLED screen and excellently tactile Sense controllers are the most obvious improvement, but plentiful quality-of-life changes and the raw horsepower of the PS5 set a new standard for how VR games should play and feel on console."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PS5 Black Friday Deals Are Now Live at Amazon</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://sonyps.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l4as99" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation’s PS5 console deals</a> are also now live for Black Friday, featuring the Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle, and NBA 2K Bundle, at just <a href="https://zdcs.link/aB1XR8?object_uuid=9f3a3370-4438-4049-9564-f62d85e33539&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$374.99 for the Digital Edition</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdd2Bp?object_uuid=9f3a3370-4438-4049-9564-f62d85e33539&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$424.99 for the Disc Edition</a>. These <a href="https://sonyps.prf.hn/click/camref:1100l4arYH" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deals are also available in the UK</a> at an equivalent price. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the best PS5 console deal of the year – and it'll likely be the last major discount heading into the holidays. If you’ve been holding out for a great price, now’s your chance. However, these deals could sell out or expire before Black Friday itself, so act quickly to secure yours and avoid disappointment. Let's take a look at what's on offer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What You Need to Use PSVR 2 on PC</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Hardware-wise, you need the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-playstation-vr-2-pc-adapter">PC adapter </a>and a PSVR 2 headset – as well as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-pc">VR-capable gaming PC</a>, naturally. You’ll also need to download the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation VR2</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamVR</a> apps from Steam. You can find the minimum PC requirements and more details on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the convenience of using one headset to play all of your VR games, what really stands out about PSVR2 on PC is the OLED display. It makes everything look bright and clear and vivid. However, the drawback for using PSVR2 on PC is that PCs can’t take advantage of some of the unique features you can access when playing on PS5. That includes things like eye tracking, HDR, and adaptive trigger support.</p></div><div catalogid="40739933-4e75-453f-b51f-6875fcca6df9" id="206473"><div id="206473" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PlayStation VR2 PC Adapter</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">When Is Black Friday 2024?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual date of <strong>Black Friday in 2024 falls on November 29</strong> this year, but the deals have already kicked off. Leading up to the big event, retailers have begun to open deals online. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each day leading up to the event will slowly roll out more deals, which ultimately leads to massive discounts on Black Friday.
