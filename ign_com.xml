It presents a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored. I’ve had so many adventures in Breath of the Wild, and each one has a unique story behind what led me to them, making them stories on top of stories. And even after I’ve spent more than 50 hours searching the far reaches of Hyrule, I still manage to come across things I haven’t seen before. I’ll easily spend 50 to 100 more trying to track down its fascinating moments.”</p><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">Other Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-capcom-fighting-collection-2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-where-to-buy">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a deals expert and commerce editor for IGN.

Excellent.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV is set to release exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2 on July 24. It comes with everything included in the original party game for Nintendo Switch, plus a new Jamboree TV expansion that’s like a game show hosted by Toad. The game is available for preorder now (<a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3OPg?object_uuid=c1e787d9-13d4-418c-a431-dabf424d69d5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Walmart</a>). Let’s dive in and look at more details.</p><p id="where-to-preorder"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to preorder">Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</h2></p><div catalogid="ad581713-13ff-4891-a62b-ffdf4bbad65c" id="218284"><div id="218284" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qd7w2p?object_uuid=c1e787d9-13d4-418c-a431-dabf424d69d5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Target</a> - $79.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3OPg?object_uuid=c1e787d9-13d4-418c-a431-dabf424d69d5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a> - $79.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QKOoP3?object_uuid=c1e787d9-13d4-418c-a431-dabf424d69d5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at GameStop</a> - $79.99</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are several ways to buy this game, depending on whether you already own the original (if you do, read on), it's only available in one edition. So that's nice.</p></div><p id="a-note-on-the-pricing"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="A note on the pricing">Yep, It Costs $79.99</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is using a sliding-scale pricing model for Switch 2 games. While most first-party original Switch games cost $59.99 (with the exception of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which cost $69.99), for Switch 2, Nintendo is cranking the ceiling up to $79.99 (at least so far). Mario Kart World is also $79.99, while other games are $69.99 or even less.</p><p id="upgrade-pack-also-sold-separately"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Upgrade pack also sold separately">Upgrade Pack Is Also Available Separately</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This version of the game comes with the original Switch game, plus the Switch 2 Edition upgrade pack. The upgrade pack boosts the base game to higher definition and faster frame rates, while also adding the Jamboree TV expansion content. If you already own the original game for Switch, you can purchase the upgrade pack separately on the Nintendo eShop and at select other retailers (as a printed download code) and save some money.</p><p id="what-is-this-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What is this game?">What Is Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV?</h2></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The big new addition here is the Switch 2-exclusive Jamboree TV expansion, which brings new modes and minigames to the party. It includes a number of minigames that use new input types, only available on Switch 2. There’s audio recognition, along with mouse controls and “more expressive rumble.” It also makes use of the Nintendo Switch 2 camera accessory (sold separately; <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q41gdG?object_uuid=c1e787d9-13d4-418c-a431-dabf424d69d5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Target</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The minigames that use the camera accessory are probably the most notable addition here, because it puts the faces of everyone playing <em>into</em> the game. Up to four players can participate using a single camera, to do things like balance digital goombas on your head, hit question blocks with your Joy-Con, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, this is probably one of the bigger expansions coming to a Switch 2 version of an original Switch game. It’s especially appealing to anyone who has people over and enjoys playing party games.</p><p id="our-review-of-the-original-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Our review of the original game">Our Review of the Original Game</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/smp-jam-blogroll-1728688361805.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that the original Jamboree on Switch was one of our favorite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/mario-party">Mario Party games</a> in a long time. From our 9/10 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review">Super Mario Party Jamboree review</a>: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Super Mario Party Jamboree is an amazing followup to Mario Party Superstars and easily one of the best games in the series. Not only does it faithfully return to the classic formula established in the Nintendo 64 entries, it confidently improves upon it with a fantastic set of boards that introduce unique and memorable mechanics. It’s also the most flexible Mario Party has ever been, with tons of ways to customize your game, including its brilliant new optional Pro Rules that reduce luck-based elements to a minimum and crank up the strategy for those who want it. The wonderful maps are supported by a great lineup of new and returning minigames and character-specific challenges that steal the show, even if I wish there were just a few more minigames in the rotation. The side offerings may not have much staying power, but when partying with friends and family locally or online, Super Mario Party Jamboree boldly completes the series’ redemption arc as its newest superstar.” </p><p id="other-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Other preorder guides">Other Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-capcom-fighting-collection-2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-where-to-buy">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a deals expert and commerce editor for IGN.

An open-world racing game, Mario Kart World is packed full of characters, vehicles, and regions from the Mushroom Kingdom for you to explore in a free-wheeling manner. You can preorder the game now at various retailers (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QL5WOX?object_uuid=a17db61c-3564-4135-a0e1-7811eca86db7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Walmart</a>). Let’s take a look.</p><p id="where-to-preorder"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to preorder">Preorder Mario Kart World</h2></p><p id="consider-the-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Consider the bundle">Switch 2 Super Mario Kart World Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="99c7633d-f4b7-4196-a84e-04f824279247" id="218299"><div id="218299" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you buy the Switch 2 bundle that includes Super Mario Kart World, you can save $30 versus buying the console and game separately. Note that the console bundle includes a digital copy, so you won’t get the actual cart or game box if you go that route. If having a physical game is important enough for you that you'll throw in an extra $30, by all means, proceed with your preorder.</p></div><p id="yes-its-7999"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Yes, it's $79.99">Yes, the MSRP Is $79.99</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Purchased by itself, the game costs $79.99, which is $10 more than standard price of AAA PlayStation and Xbox games this generation. While I don’t love seeing game prices getting hiked up between generations, I know games are more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive">expensive</a> to make than ever these days. In any case, I'm hopeful it indicates the scale of Mario Kart World makes it worth the extra money.</p><p id="what-is-this-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What is this game?">What Is Mario Kart World?</h2></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World promises to be the biggest Mario Kart game yet. It's designed as an all-encompassing open world, much like the Forza Horizon series. In Grand Prix mode, you can even drive from the end of one track to the start of the next after finishing a race.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tracks in Mario Kart World are altered by things like weather conditions and the time of day, which can affect your visibility and traction as you race around. You can also veer off the actual track at any point and drive “virtually everywhere,” according to Nintendo. Each race has 24 drivers, more than any previous Mario Kart game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Knockout Tour is a new mode that lets you race from one corner of the open world to the other. Along the way, you'll drive through checkpoints that have placements listed on them; if you’re lagging behind the required placement as you reach a checkpoint, you’ll be eliminated from the race.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If that sounds too hectic to you, you can choose to drive anywhere you want in the world in Free Roam mode. You can team up with friends as you leisurely cruise around, and take photos along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More info about Mario Kart World is coming during an April 17 Nintendo Direct.
