We're not sure, but Embark shared the image, below, showing what appears to be a dead raider in the snow, suggesting the frigid weather could be more deadly than merely inconvenient. As one fan quipped in response: "I can’t wait to have all of my s**t stolen from people camping in basements on extraction points covered in snow."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="und" dir="ltr">16.12.25 <a href="https://t.co/UxQH0nAP1L" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/UxQH0nAP1L</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1998437491053834510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Cold Snap is the last update listed as part of Arc Raiders' 2025 content roadmap, and Embark has yet to outline what's coming in 2026. The previous update, rolled out at the end of November, involved a "very hot fix for the locked room exploits," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-patch-notes-teased-a-very-hot-fix-for-locked-room-exploits-and-now-cheaters-are-getting-cooked"><u>and it turned out they weren’t kidding</u></a> after some players had been cheating their way into locked rooms as before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders sold over 4 million copies worldwide within two weeks of launch, cementing its commercial success.
