This particular model boasts a massive 25,000mAh battery capacity, 165W of total charging output, and two built-in USB Type-C cables in case you forget to bring your own. It's also attractively priced at under $100, and there's even a deal today that drops the price by another $10 to $89.99. This is a great complement to your power-hungry gaming handheld PC like the Steam Deck, Asus Rog Ally, or Lenovo Legion Go.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New Release: Anker 25,000mAh 165W Power Bank</h2><div catalogid="8479891f-e34a-4cd8-951d-5230aeb5aeed" id="215024"><div id="215024" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker 25,000mAh 165W Power Bank with Two Built-In USB Type-C Cables</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Anker power bank features a 25,000mAh battery capacity, which is the second largest capacity we've seen from Anker in a compact form factor. So how much juice will that offer to today's gaming handheld PCs? A 25,000mAh battery equates to a 95Whr capacity. An 80% power efficiency rating (which is standard for power banks) means you get about 76Whr of usable charge. That means this power bank will charge a Steam Deck or ROG Ally (40Whr) from empty to completely full <strong>2 times</strong>, an Asus ROG Ally X (80Whr) <strong>1 time</strong>, and a Nintendo Switch (16Whr) about <strong>4.75 times</strong>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Anker power bank has one USB Type-C port and one USB Type-A port. In addition, there are two built-in USB Type-C cables. One is a retractable cable that can extend up to 2.3 feet. The other is a fixed 1-foot cable that doubles up as a lanyard when not in use. Each USB Type-C port is capable of up to 100W of Power Delivery with a total 165W maximum output. That means all three USB outputs are capable of charging any gaming handheld PC at its fastest rate, including the Asus ROG Ally X, which supports up to 100W of fast charging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another feature common to Anker's other premium power banks is the digital LCD readout. It displays a wealth of information like remaining battery capacity, current charging rate, input/output wattage, battery temperature, battery health, charge cycle count, and more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TSA-Approved</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">TSA states that power banks must be under 100Whr in capacity for carry-on (check-in is not allowed under any circumstances). This Anker power bank is rated at 95Whr. You might get checked simply because this is a relatively hefty power bank, but you shouldn't have any problems getting it cleared.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">See more power banks we've recommended</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-sets-february-release-date-for-the-thing-and-human-torch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals"><u>Marvel Rivals</u></a> will round out The Fantastic Four team when The Thing and Human Torch launch as playable characters on February 21, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The release date for the new heroes in Marvel and NetEase Games’ popular hero shooter was announced today, revealing that they'll arrive alongside an update for the second half of Season 1. Although the team has yet to spill the beans on what exactly this Season 1.5 update has in store, <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a Dev Talk blog post</u></a> on the Marvel Rivals website teased “major balance adjustments.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for The Thing and Human Torch, we have yet to see exactly how the two classic heroes will light up the roster with their new moves and abilities. Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman were introduced as the first post-launch Marvel Rivals heroes when Season 1 launched last month. Both characters brought along unique tools to shift the multiplayer game’s meta in a new direction, with Reed Richards able to take stretchy (and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-are-stretching-mister-fantastics-meme-potential-to-its-limit"><u>goofy</u></a>) swings at enemies thanks to his elastic powers while Sue Storm introduced invisibility mechanics to the battlefield. Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm will surely do the same when they launch in a few weeks, but let’s hope NetEase reveals some gameplay before then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upcoming Marvel Rivals Season 1 update will also see Ranked players hit with a rank reset. Come February 21, expect to see your Rank drop four divisions, meaning if you’re a Diamond I player on February 20, you’ll be brought down to Platinum II the following day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase explained how this process will carry on in the future, saying that brand-new seasons will hit players with a six-division drop, while half-season updates will bring a four-division drop. As Marvel Rivals continues to tweak its Ranked offerings to players’ desires, NetEase said it will “tune this as necessary.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not all doom and gloom, though, as competitive Marvel fans in the Gold rank can look forward to new costume rewards with the launch of the second half of Season 1. NetEase will also be introducing new Crests of Honor to “recognize players at Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All (the top 500).”</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Superhero fans had been not-so-patiently waiting to hear more about how Marvel Rivals will continue its post-launch plans, and The Fantastic Four is just the beginning. Last month, creative director Guangyun Chen drummed up excitement by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-promises-a-new-hero-every-month-and-a-half"><u>promising to release a new playable character every half-season</u></a>. That means a fresh Marvel face will join the fight roughly every six weeks, giving fans plenty to keep coming back for as seasonal updates progress. There’s quite a bit of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-blade-first-look-image-and-in-game-lore-leak-suggests-season-2-release"><u>evidence to suggest the vampire-hunting Daywalker Blade</u></a> is next on the list, though outside of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-fear-netease-is-planting-fake-hero-leaks-to-throw-off-dataminers-but-whats-really-going-on"><u>some rumors and leaks that have had players arguing for the last few weeks</u></a>, Marvel Rivals’ future remains a mystery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-characters"><u>our current Marvel Rivals Season 1 tier list to find out the best characters</u></a> while you wait for the mid-season update to shake things up.
