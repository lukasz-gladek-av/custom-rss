I haven't touched Bloodborne Remake for a year for 50 reasons (too big, too risky to finally be C&amp;D).</p><p> But last week I decided to start a new project from scratch, Bloodborne Top Down Arena</p><p>Maybe you won't like it, but I'm enjoying developing it and playing it üòÇ <a href="https://t.co/OPont0sS45" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/OPont0sS45</a></p></div>‚Äî Maxime Foulquier (@MaximFoulquier) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853835793388953662?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The gameplay looks very much as you‚Äôd expect: FromSoftware‚Äôs hugely popular Bloodborne but with the camera pulled up into an action RPG perspective. The repurposed Bloodborne combat is action RPG snappy, perhaps a good fit for a Diablo-style game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Foulquier <a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853834672347758739" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> Bloodborne Top Down Arena is "less ambitious and different from a true remake‚Äù of Bloodborne, so hopes it will avoid falling into the crosshairs of Sony‚Äôs lawyers. ‚ÄúThe Demake and the Minecraft Project didn't receive CnD so I cross the fingers,‚Äù Foulquier added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs worth noting that the developer behind Bloodborne Nightmare Kart <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nightmare-kart-bloodborne-kart-release-date">ended up re-jipping the game after Sony got in touch</a>, so perhaps Foulquier is being a little naive here. Foulquier insisted, however, that because Bloodborne Top Down Arena is not planned for release on Steam, it will avoid a similar fate.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah but I don't want to release this on Steam.</p>‚Äî Maxime Foulquier (@MaximFoulquier) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1854087594008617080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, what Bloodborne fans really want is a sequel to the PS4 classic, or, saving that, a next-gen update for the original game. Neither are so far announced from either FromSoftware or Sony. In February, ahead of the launch of FromSoftware‚Äôs Elden Ring expansion Shadow of the Erdtree, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5">director Hidetaka Miyazaki said that because the developer doesn‚Äôt own the Bloodborne IP</a>, he can‚Äôt speak about its future. He did, however, admit Bloodborne would benefit from releasing on more modern hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-ps5-pro-can-you-see-the-difference">IGN has had a look at Bloodborne running on the PS5 Pro</a>, which launches November 7 priced $700. And then there‚Äôs <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-no-bloodborne-remake-but-there-is-a-bloodborne-outfit-for-astro-bot">the Bloodborne cameo in recently released PS5 exclusive Astro Bot</a>, if you‚Äôre desperate for a fix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Once players have collected one of each of these Pok√©mon the 3 Star Mew card will unlock.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/06/mew-1730901811705.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The 3 Star Mew card in Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket.</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only condition is the cards must also be from Genetic Apex, meaning, for example, that collecting the promotional Butterfree card from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">the special Lapras ex event</a> won't count towards the 150 total despite it being among the first 150 Pok√©mon. Any version of the Pok√©mon from Genetic Apex will work, however, whether it's an ex or alternative art or regular or whatever else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While simple, collecting so many cards may still take some time. One player recently worked out it could take almost two years of daily play to collect every card in the set, though thankfully hitting the 150 necessary for Mew will require considerably less time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mew holds a special place in the set as one of just four 3 Star cards, meaning it's one of the special immersive cards with fully animated artwork. It joins Charizard, Pikachu, and Mewtwo in this category, the three Pok√©mon which feature on the booster pack covers of Genetic Apex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pok√©mon TCG Pocket arrived in October as a streamlined, digital version of the beloved trading card game. It has players opening packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collecting cards</a>, building decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battling others;</a> a simple formula that's already proved popular given it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">$12 million in four days</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players may otherwise want to keep an eye out from cards from the two decks currently dominating the Pok√©mon TCG Pocket meta, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">headlined by usual suspects Charizard ex and Mewtwo ex</a>.

Those paying $9.99 a month for the Premium Pass can collect all cards in 437 days, though the subscription would add up to almost $150 in this time.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/06/machamp-1730896591108.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The alternative art Machamp ex and the regular Machamp ex.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those not desperate to collect every alternate art card, identifiable by their artwork expanding beyond the normal borders to cover the entire card, can do so in just 130 days, or 87 with the Premium Pass. Developer Creatures Inc. will presumably release a new set of 200 to 300 cards every three or four months, so those playing every day should just about be able to complete one before another comes out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pok√©mon TCG Pocket, like many other free-to-play mobile games with microtransactions, floods players with dozens of packs on their first day as they complete simple quests and gain large amounts of experience. But this generosity soon dries up as the option to pay real money for packs is waved in front of players, and those not willing to spend can open one new pack just every 12 hours. The Premium Pass lets players open one extra pack a day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPCollector also provided some tips on how players can optimize their collecting, recommending that Wonder Picks only be used to collect 2 Star rarity cards. Pok√©mon TCG Pocket cards are classified by rarity, with the standard 226 ranging from 1 Diamond to 4 Diamond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 60 alternate art cards range from 1 Star to 3 Stars, followed by three super special gold background Crown cards. Regular alternate arts are 1 Star, ex Pok√©mon are 2 Star, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date-set-for-october">the special immersive cards with fully animated artwork</a> are 3 Star.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most efficient way to collect cards is therefore only to pick out alternate art ex Pok√©mon in Wonder Picks, though it's far from guaranteed one will appear in the regularly rotating spots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, players should only use Pack Points to obtain the 3 Star and Crown cards. These are the points players acquire for opening regular booster packs, obtained at the rate of five per pack. Cards at 3 Star cost 1,500 points, demanding the opening of 300 packs, and Crown cards cost 2,500 points, meaning 500 packs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will obviously take a long time to get there, but TCGPCollector is essentially recommending players play the long game and not be tempted to exchange Pack Points for cheap cards they'll come across in booster packs eventually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the last recommendation implores players not to use Pok√© Gold to buy packs, noting that the Premium Pass and, again, a little patience, is a much better way to spend money. Spending $9.99 on a Pok√© Gold bundle instead of the Premium Pass, for example, would allow players to open just nine packs compared to the 30 accrued over the course of a month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the best shop bundle, which grants 690 Pok√© Gold for $99.99, grants just 115 packs and therefore averages out at 87 cents per pack. This is much more than the 33 cents per pack average from the Premium Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This financial logic isn't enough to stop many, many players from buying bundles of Pok√© Gold, of course. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">Pok√©mon TCG Pocket pulled in a whopping $12 million in its first four days</a>, so the simple routine of opening packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collecting cards</a>, building decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battling others</a> is certainly enticing enough to open the purse strings of players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The digital, streamlined version of the traditional Pok√©mon Trading Card Game is keeping players entertained in other ways, with Creatures Inc. having already launched two events including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">one that allows players to win a Lapras ex</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players may otherwise want to keep an eye out from cards from the two decks currently dominating the Pok√©mon TCG Pocket meta, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">headlined by usual suspects Charizard ex and Mewtwo ex</a>.

We never confirmed it. There were some discussions of course. There was some misalignment, there was some misinformation, but at the end of the day there won‚Äôt be any Denuvo at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWith that, I would like you to close the case already. Stop texting under every post we do that Denuvo is in the game, because it‚Äôs not. We never announced‚Ä¶ we never said it will be there. As I said, a bit of a misunderstanding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúThat is something you should really remember, as long as Warhorse doesn‚Äôt announce anything it‚Äôs not true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúLet‚Äôs bury that thing and let‚Äôs never ever talk about it any more. What we can talk about though is the game.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This all stems from an apparent email sent by publisher Plaion that appeared to confirm Denuvo <em>would</em> be used in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Clearly, though, that is not the case.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Denuvo is a controversial system used by video game developers and publishers to stem the tide of video game piracy by, they hope, pushing back the release of cracked versions of their games by sometimes weeks, maybe months, and in some cases, indefinitely. From a publisher perspective, Denuvo helps to prevent lost sales and revenue it might have received if those who pirate a video game at launch would have otherwise bought it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Denuvo is often criticized by PC gamers for potentially affecting video game performance and even reducing the life-span of solid-state drives (SSDs). Denuvo has repeatedly denied the claims. In 2021, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-resident-evil-village-cracked-performance-beats-official-code" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a> found the pirate version of Resident Evil Village actually improved performance. Capcom later patched the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, we‚Äôve seen some developers even announce that their games won‚Äôt launch with Denuvo, much to the delight of PC gamers. In October, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-does-not-include-any-3rd-party-drm-including-denuvo">BioWare confirmed <u>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u> wouldn‚Äôt have third-party DRM of any kind</a>, including Denuvo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, it‚Äôs set to launch February 11, 2025. Check out IGN‚Äôs <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-the-first-preview">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 ‚Äì The First Preview</a> for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
