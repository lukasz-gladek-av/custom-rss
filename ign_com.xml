            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-gets-casual-mention-in-xbox-indies-post-sends-community-into-a-fervor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Cue the Pepe Silvia meme.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight fans have been waiting quite a while for news about its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. The wait has been so unbearable that even a casual mention, like the one Xbox dropped in a recent ID@Xbox post, can ignite the fires of those holding out for a 2025 drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/18/idxbox-developers-finding-success-with-xbox/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>, ID@Xbox director Guy Richards shared a post detailing how over $5 billion have been paid to independent developers through the program. It mostly goes over the success of past ID@Xbox launches, ranging from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/neva">Neva</a>. Then, in a portion about upcoming games, we get the name-drop:</p><blockquote>"Looking ahead, our lineup is incredible with upcoming games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Descenders Next, and FBC: Firebreak to play across the whole Xbox universe… and of course Hollow Knight: Silksong too!"</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This mostly confirms that Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch sometime between me typing this, right now, and the end of all time. Granted, those games are interesting mentions. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is set for April 24, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/descenders-next">Descenders Next</a> for April 9, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> has had a tentative 2025 window. This could imply Hollow Knight: Silksong is within some measure of grasp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are, to some degree, understandably impatient to learn whether Silksong might arrive, as it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gameplay-trailer-news">been roughly six years since its announcement</a>. Now, let's see how the Silksong faithful are reacting to this mention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Where's the bait?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1je8o1b/silksong_is_officially_mentioned_in_an_official/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one commenter asked</a> on the Silksong subreddit. Another said: "Silksong being mentioned by Xbox?" and followed it up with an image of the Squid Game Season 2 scene where protagonist Seong Gi-hun declares: "I have played these games before!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a palpable air of both joking and irony that comes with communities like this, where groups have essentially bonded over waiting for news about something. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1jetj81/i_swear_we_are_a_circus_at_this_point/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another post</a> draws attention to this, noting that "we" — the Silksong holdouts — are a "circus at this point," making their point with the Patrick Star/Man Ray meme format.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The prevailing hope, or joke, is that news about Hollow Knight: Silksong is destined for April 2, during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-announced-for-april">Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct</a>. To fans' credit, developer Team Cherry did stoke the flames a bit with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake">some vague posting around the official reveal of the Switch 2</a>. The believers hold out hope, while the doubters sow doubt. "We are an [$8] Mega Buffoon Pack," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1jetj81/comment/milnxg4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one commenter said</a> in response to the circus meme. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hope and doubt comes in all shapes and sizes. But my favorite response to Xbox casually saying, "and of course Hollow Knight: Silksong too!" and all the speculation and cycles this causes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1je8o1b/silksong_is_officially_mentioned_in_an_official/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">came from Reddit user u/cerberusthedoge</a>: "We got Hollow Knight Silksong 2 before Hollow Knight Silksong."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
