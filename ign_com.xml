            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/persona5-the-phantom-x-brings-the-phantom-thieves-to-pc-and-mobile-devices-next-month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Atlus has revealed its free-to-play spinoff, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x">Persona5: The Phantom X</a>, is coming to PC and mobile devices June 26, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Persona series developer announced a release date for its latest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-5">Persona 5</a> spinoff with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQsdIWTGn_Y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an hour-long breakdown video</a> today. It’s being developed as part of a collaboration between Atlus, Sega, and Perfect World and reintroduces players to the Phantom Thieves along with new faces, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Japanese and English versions of Persona5: The Phantom X will launch simultaneously next month, but this scaled-down story from the Persona 5 universe isn’t completely new. It was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-the-phantom-x-announced-for-ios-and-android">announced in 2023</a> and originally launched in China in 2024. The live-service title's developers have continued to iron out the kinks since then, and now, it’s finally ready to reach new audiences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Encompassed in the unique turn-based RPG gameplay and setting of <em>Persona 5</em>, players will lead a double life as a student and a Phantom Thief with a brand-new protagonist and band of Phantom Thieves,” an official description from Atlus says. “During the day, players will build up life experience as a student and engage in various activities such as hanging out with your friends and part time jobs, while at night, they will sneak into the cognitive dungeons to steal Treasures and change the twisted desires of corrupt adults!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re a Persona 5 fan, you’ll be happy to know The Phantom X still features that game’s stylish turn-based gameplay. Players can also look forward to exploring jobs and extracurricular activities while enjoying new mini-games unique to this specific entry. Atlus wants you to know this is a tried-and-true Persona experience, as it confirms its involvement in writing and supervising some of the original side stories the game offers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona5: The Phantom X will be viewed through the eyes of an entirely new protagonist as well as a new collection of Phantom Thieves, but Joker and other original Phantom Thieves members will show up via special contracts, too. Players will also be free to take advantage of new modes, including a PvE mode called The Velvet Trials as well as new Mementos and a new Guild feature.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Persona5: The Phantom X Steam Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“However, one regret we have is that we had to take this long to be able to announce a Western release,” Sega's Jun Matsunaga said during the video presentation, “and we’re very sorry to our Western fans for keeping them in the dark for so long. As we know, this game was originally developed by Perfect World in China. When we first started to plan for a global release, for a series like Persona that is very popular in the West, we wanted to make sure that for a Western release, everything in the game from the setting to the tone of story matched the standard Western fans had for a Persona game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona 5 launched all the way back in 2016 and has received a plethora of spinoffs since. These include crossovers with other titles such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/07/persona-5s-joker-is-coming-to-super-smash-bros-ultimate-as-dlc">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, as well as standalone experiences, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-5-strikers">Persona 5 Strikers</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-5-tactica">Persona 5 Tactica</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-5-dancing-star-night">Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight</a>. We've heard little about what a potential Persona 6 might entail, but you can still read up on everything we know about it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-6-everything-we-know-so-far">here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
