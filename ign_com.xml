            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Krafton has issued a response to a recent lawsuit filed by the former leads of Subnautica 2, offering rebuttals to the developers' claims and alleging they "resorted to litigation to demand a multimillion-dollar payout they haven't earned."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes in reply to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-leaders-accuse-krafton-of-hindering-games-release-firing-them-to-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus">legal complaint</a> filed by former Unknown Worlds CEO Ted Gill, and fellow co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, last month. In it, the former leads alleged that Krafton went out of its way to hinder Subnautica 2's development, delay the game, and ultimately fire them from their roles all in an effort to stop them and other employees from collecting a $250 million bonus payment that would have kicked in if the game's early access released on time later this year and reached certain sales milestones.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In its <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">response</a>, Krafton says the game was planned for a Q1 2024 release. However, "Cleveland and McGuire abandoned their roles as studio-wide Game Director and Technical Director to focus on their personal passion projects and quit making games for Unknown Worlds entirely. And Gill, who remained, focused on leveraging his operational control to maximize the earnout payment, rather than developing a successful game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Krafton goes on to allege that by 2023, Unknown Worlds' development director had commented on the founders being "checked out," and that Cleveland in particular had stated publicly he had abandoned video games to pursue filmmaking. The release date of Subnautica slipped to 2024 and then 2025. "An internal assessment of the first playable in March of 2024 made clear that the team had failed to deliver on their promise of developing sufficiently new content. But rather than roll up their sleeves and make the game they had promised, the Key Employees blamed others and overhauled the team." Krafton also says that the leads continued reducing the scope of the game over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The response says that by spring 2025, Krafton was trying to stop them from releasing the game, saying it was not ready. However, Krafton alleges the leads tried to release it anyway in order to get their maximum earnout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Krafton, fearing how an underbaked EA Subnautica 2 would be received by both existing fans and the broader market, urged Cleveland and McGuire to return to their posts to generate a market-ready product that would not disappoint fans. Cleveland and McGuire declined. In response to Krafton's request for the Key Employees to return to lead the development of Subnautica 2, Gill stated that '[t]here's no coming back to a job they didn't have.'" Krafton further alleges that the leads said they would self-publish the game without Krafton, and that they downloaded "massive amounts of confidential information" from Unknown Worlds.</p><blockquote>The Key Employees' insistence on releasing the game immediately was singularly driven by self-interest in obtaining the earnout. At every turn during development, the Key Employees were laser focused on avoiding "a timeline that doesn't tank the earnout opportunity" and scheduling the release to maximize their payments. Conversations throughout the post-acquisition period make clear the Key Employee's [sic] focus was on their payday, and not on the game. As early as 2022, an employee who was due to receive a portion of the earnout stated that despite the significant delays in the game, he was confident "Ted [Gill] will <em><strong>concoct a scheme to get us that earnout</strong></em>." [emphasis Krafton's]</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The response goes on to issue answers to every claim in the founders' lawsuit, paragraph by paragraph. Krafton asks the court to rule in its favor, deny the founders' claims for relief, and award Krafton costs, including attorney fees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This saga began in July, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-developers-entire-leadership-team-replaced-in-shock-move-krafton-said-will-bring-renewed-energy-and-momentum">Krafton seemingly out of the blue</a> announced it would replace Unknown Worlds' leads with former Striking Distance CEO Steve Papoutsis. In the weeks that followed, reports emerged surrounding the $250 million bonus promised to staff amid questions as to whether that payout would be honored. While the Subnautica leads claimed in various statements and in their lawsuit that Krafton had tried to delay Subnautica 2 and ultimately fired them to avoid paying them the bonus, Krafton accused them of neglecting their duties, saying Subnautica 2 was not ready to launch. That final claim remains up in the air, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaked documents</a> since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-drama-gets-even-messier-as-krafton-confirms-internal-document-leak-is-real">verified by Krafton</a> confirming that Unknown Worlds was receiving feedback from the publisher that the game was not ready for early access launch. However, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-16/-subnautica-2-leaders-say-krafton-sabotaged-game-over-payout" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report from Bloomberg</a> suggests this may not have been wholly true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Cards like <a href="https://zdcs.link/985ZYw?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Raging Bolt ex</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8wRO?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iron Crown ex</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aebk66?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walking Wake ex</a> were once among the most sought-after pulls from the set, but all three have dropped from their spring peaks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raging Bolt ex is down <strong>11%</strong> from its May value of <strong>$82.36</strong> and now trades around <strong>$73.45</strong>, while Iron Crown ex has fallen <strong>13%</strong> in the same timeframe, moving from <strong>$55.74</strong> to <strong>$48.30</strong>. Walking Wake ex has taken the hardest hit of the trio, losing <strong>20%</strong> since May, with its price sliding from <strong>$50.37</strong> to <strong>$40.45</strong>. This downturn mirrors a wider cooling in the set’s high-end singles as both players and collectors reassess their priorities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Twilight Masquerade has seen a more mixed picture, with some cards losing steam while others continue to gain. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8jGO?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perrin</a> has eased down <strong>11%</strong> from March, moving from <strong>$106.43</strong> to <strong>$94.87</strong>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbbBer?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carmine</a> has dipped the same percentage since June, going from <strong>$78.70</strong> to <strong>$69.99</strong>. Both are Special Illustration Rare Supporters that enjoyed early interest thanks to their unique effects, but neither has become a fixture in competitive lists, leading to softer demand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, the set’s Illustration Rares and certain Pokémon ex cards are climbing in value as interest from both casual and competitive buyers grows.<a href="https://zdcs.link/92xnkW?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gastly</a> has risen <strong>13%</strong> since June, from <strong>$35.74</strong> to <strong>$40.99</strong>, helped by its role in Gengar evolution lines and appealing artwork. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpYV2?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greninja ex</a> has climbed <strong>17%</strong> since January, from <strong>$18.44</strong> to <strong>$21.59</strong>, thanks to its versatile attacks and solid HP. <a href="https://zdcs.link/z62r5R?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sinistcha ex</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G0Pw?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tatsugiri</a> have each moved up <strong>10%</strong> since April, now priced at <strong>$21.59</strong> and <strong>$18.48</strong> respectively, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKg3xB?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eevee</a> has gained <strong>10%</strong> from early August to reach <strong>$21.59</strong>. These changes highlight how certain cards can gain value steadily over months due to competitive experimentation, collector interest, or them just being stunning cards. Let's break this all down:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/pixel-9-5-1754923308215.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For cards that saw heavy demand early on, the market has cooled. Some have slipped due to a lack of tournament use, others because collectors have shifted their focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/985ZYw?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Raging Bolt ex</a> brings explosive plays with Bursting Roar to refill your hand and Climactic Descent to convert discarded Basic Energy into heavy damage. It looked set to become a staple in certain builds, but the high retreat cost and inconsistent setup have made it less reliable in practice. As competitive players experiment with more stable options, extra copies have been hitting the market. The Special Illustration Rare artwork still turns heads in a binder, but with demand slowing, Its price has slipped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8wRO?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iron Crown ex</a> offers useful bench support in Future decks through Cobalt Command, adding damage to your other Future Pokémon’s attacks. Twin Shotels provides a reliable way to apply pressure across the board, bypassing common defenses. Despite this, it has not found a consistent place in top tournament lists, and collector buying has eased off. Without strong competitive results to keep attention high, the price has edged down since May.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aebk66?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walking Wake ex</a> debuted with plenty of buzz thanks to Azure Wave, which ignores effects on the opponent’s Active Pokémon, and Cathartic Roar, which can hit 240 damage under the right conditions. The trick has been making those conditions happen consistently. Decks built around it have seen mixed success, and without the sustained performance to keep it in the spotlight, its Special Illustration Rare price has fallen noticeably from its early high.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8jGO?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Perrin</a> gives players the option to cycle Pokémon from hand into the deck and fetch an equal number in return. It can be a valuable setup tool in certain builds, but it faces competition from other Supporters that fit more universally into current decks such as PRofessors Research. Collectors still appreciate the detailed Special Illustration Rare art, yet its price has eased back since March as demand from both has softened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QbbBer?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carmine</a> is one of the few cards that can be used on the very first turn when going first, letting you discard your hand and draw five cards. It can enable quick starts, but the narrow conditions for use mean it often sits unused. As the metagame evolves, it's not become a fixture in competitive decks, and its Special Illustration Rare has seen its value slip since June. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/pixel-9-6-1754923437758.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not every card is moving down. Loads of Twilight Masquerade singles have been gradually climbing in value over months, thanks to a mix of playability, collector interest, and unique artwork.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G0Pw?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tatsugiri</a> is a small but effective utility card for certain strategies. Attract Customers can pull a Supporter from the top six cards of your deck if it is in the Active Spot, offering a low-maintenance way to find key cards. Its single retreat cost and light-hearted Illustration Rare artwork make it a popular pick for collectors as well. Since April, that mix of function and style has helped it hold steady gains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z62r5R?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sinistcha ex</a> benefits from Re-Brew, an attack that spreads damage based on the Grass Energy in your discard before shuffling it back into your deck. Matcha Splash offers reliable damage while healing your team, which can matter in longer matches. As Grass-focused decks see more experimentation, this Special Illustration Rare has moved upward in value since April.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QKg3xB?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eevee</a> is always in demand among collectors, and the Twilight Masquerade Illustration Rare shows a group of them cuddled up on a comphy chair. Ascension allows it to evolve quickly, which can be useful in certain setups, though its main draw is its place in the franchise’s history. Since early August, interest has pushed the price up slightly. I expect this card go carry on growing in value indefinately, albiet in small increments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpYV2?object_uuid=e84a266b-4131-4a87-8b05-7b5a0239b87a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greninja ex</a> offers strong offensive options in Shinobi Blade and Mirage Barrage, the latter being able to hit two targets at once. That combination of damage output and flexibility makes it appealing for a variety of decks. The stunning Special Illustration Rare artwork and Greninja fighting for the starter Pokémon top spot with Charizard adds collector appeal, and trainers are willing to pay a premium to get their hands on one of the most valuable Pokémon cards in the Scarlet and Violet era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gastly combines a distinctive Illustration Rare design, showing and also evolving into competitive Gengar deck builds. Mysterious Beam offers potential energy disruption, and Suffocating Gas gives cheap damage when needed. Its appeal has been as much about binder displays as tournament tables, and since June it has been steadily rising in value.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Last Week's Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week’s Pokémon TCG market update saw Paldean Fates and Hidden Fates dominating the spotlight, with several Special Illustration Rares and Shiny Vault classics making notable moves.
