Additionally, Ys Net claimed that such acts "may amount to trademark infringement and unfair competition" and therefore it was now preparing "appropriate measures" and exploring legal options. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Breaking News ‼️ </p><p>A trailer for Shenmue IV appears to have been leaked from Sega.

Last week's Shenmue 4 video is, seemingly, yet another example of this.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ys Net Inc. has confirmed that a video has been posted on social media which uses our company logo without permission, falsely giving the impression that it is an an official 'Shenmue 4' related video produced by us," the company wrote.
