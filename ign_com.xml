            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-might-be-the-series-coziest-jrpg-yet-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After over two dozen mainline games, I can only imagine how difficult it must be to innovate and stay relevant in an era where a great game is coming out every few weeks, but that‚Äôs exactly what KOEI TECMO aims to do with the next entry in its long-running Atelier JRPG series, Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories and the Envisioned Land. After spending over six hours gathering resources, doing Sailor Moon-esque magical dancing rituals, and riding around on a motorbike, I‚Äôm inclined to believe they‚Äôll pull off just that, yet again. With more engaging combat, improved visuals, more convenient crafting, and an entirely new building system that lets you put your own personal touch on the world, there‚Äôs quite a bit to be optimistic about, even if what I saw of the story and characters was, at least so far in the opening hours, pretty boilerplate stuff for the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you‚Äôve played any of the recent Atelier games, then you probably won‚Äôt be shocked by Atelier Yumia at first glance. All three of the pillars that have been around since its conception are still alive and well: exploration, where you run around collecting resources and solving puzzles; combat, where you fight baddens with a party chock-full of pretty anime friends, and synthesis, where you combine your hard-won resources into alchemical creations that make you stronger. But each has been given a substantial overhaul (not to mention a serious facelift) that breathes new life into a familiar formula.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat seems to be getting the biggest rework, with action-based systems that let you perfect parry, dodge out of the way, and switch to different range bands depending on whether you‚Äôd like to thwack enemies in melee or take them down from a distance. At lower levels, combat seemed fairly undemanding, as I was able to just unload every ability I had, swap to other characters to do the same, then repeat it all again, ending most encounters in a matter of seconds, but later on (and especially when I wasn‚Äôt properly leveled) I seriously got rinsed if I wasn‚Äôt paying attention to enemy attack patterns and working on my timing. It never got especially challenging so long as I was properly leveled, but it was nice to see a less passive combat system that I couldn‚Äôt just steamroll through while on autopilot.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat seems to be getting the biggest rework.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploration also had some improvements, like having a gun to stun enemies and collect resources at a distance, ziplines that help you navigate the map more easily once you find and activate both sides of the line, and, crucially, a badass motorcycle for you to speed around on that makes getting around much easier. Finally, there‚Äôs Synthesis, which in typically Atelier fashion is so dang complicated, you could spend quite a bit of time customizing and min-maxing every aspect of your gear and crafting new items and attacks to use in battle. Or, if you don‚Äôt have the patience like me, you can just hit ‚Äúauto mode‚Äù and it‚Äôll automatically optimize all of it for you. Not that I don‚Äôt enjoy this aspect of the series, but it‚Äôs certainly nice to have the option of leaping back into the action quickly for times where I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to tinker.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Atelier Yumia also shakes things up by adding a fourth fairly significant activity to the list of things to do as you explore and level up: the ability to build and customize settlements throughout the world map. That‚Äôs right ‚Äì Atelier Yumia seems to be leaning into the cozy craze, so now you can have a little bit of Animal Crossing or Sims with your JRPG by constructing your fantasy cottage on a patch of land and spending some quality downtime with your party members. I was only able to dabble in this a bit, given the constraint of the resources available to me in the early part of the story, but I could definitely see myself sinking quite a bit of time into taming the wilds with an elaborately decorated home.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all Atelier has going for it, I will say that it did very little to make itself stand out in terms of story. The characters and foreshadowing of the undoubtedly epic and convoluted story that starts to develop in the opening hours aren‚Äôt bad by any means, but at least so far everything has been quite predictable and retreads a lot of ground we‚Äôve seen from JRPGs of the past. This is especially true of the characters I met during my explorations, like the ditzy by wholesome Isla and the stoic and no-nonsense Viktor, both of whom I feel like I‚Äôve seen half a hundred times already. But this is the beginning of a JRPG, so in all likelihood it‚Äôs just going to take a while for the story to start rolling or for characters to show their true colors to any level of satisfaction, leaving plenty of opportunity for my concerns to disappear given more time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt mention that Atelier Yumia marks the first time the series will appear on the Xbox platform, and as a Westerner who would quite like more JRPGs to be readily available, that‚Äôs pretty awesome to see. Achievement unlocked!</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Included with an ammo chest of new features, weapons, and more content was the return of the fan-favorite skate-themed map, Grind. The skatepark arena has been brought back mostly as fans remember it, with one exception being a giant, in-game TV screen featuring a very Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater-looking logo and a date of March 4, 2025.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Looks like a teaser for something related to Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater has been found in Black Ops 6‚Äôs Grind MP map!</p><p>Announcement on March 4. üëÄ <a href="https://t.co/8efl6Qansl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/8efl6Qansl</a></p></div>‚Äî CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It stops short of being in-your-face but is still undeniably an eyebrow-raising reference for fans who have been on the lookout for another entry in the Pro Skater series. Rumors that another installment could soon be announced began earlier this week when fellow skater Tyshawn Jones let it slip that he would soon be featured in an upcoming Tony Hawk video game (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-skater-claims-hes-in-a-new-tony-hawk-remaster-about-to-come-out/#google_vignette" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a Tony Hawk coming out, so that‚Äôs cool,‚Äù Jones said during a conversation on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3umK3xG7Ly4&amp;t=1s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Breakfast Club podcast</u></a>. ‚ÄúThey got a new one they remastering so that‚Äôs about to come out. I was in the last one.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a curious comment that had fans excited, with today‚Äôs newly revealed Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater Black Ops 6 Easter Egg letting them know when they can expect to learn more. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no telling what exactly that March date has in store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision tried to breathe life into the franchise with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5">Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater 5</a> back in 2015 but has yet to release another new numbered entry since. However, in 2020, fans received the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2">Pro Skater 1 + 2 remakes</a> from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-developer-vicarious-visions-blizzard-entertainment">Vicarious Visions</a>. That means it‚Äôs been five years since a Tony Hawk game hit store shelves. With so much evidence lining up for a big reveal next month, it seems the wait may soon be over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to see what that March 4 reveal has lined up, you can read up on a few of the other skateboarding-themed inclusions in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 2 Reloaded, including a pack of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activisions-costly-call-of-duty-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-crossover-has-some-players-saying-black-ops-6-should-just-go-free-to-play-at-this-point">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle cosmetics that have some fans upset</a>. You can also see Tony Hawk himself confirm that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawk-teases-pro-skater-anniversary-plans-it-will-be-something-the-fans-will-truly-appreciate">he was working with Actvision again as of last year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
