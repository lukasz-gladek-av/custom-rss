The end of Xbox Avatar Editor support means that users will no long be able to access Xbox Avatars or any of their purchased avatar items. Xbox says it will refund all Avatar purchases made between November 1, 2023 and January 9, 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox is specifically ending support for the Avatars introduced as part of the Xbox Avatars Update back in 2018, which were touted as more detailed, expressive and creative than their predecessors on the Xbox 360. Xbox says it will retain support for the simpler Xbox Original Avatars, which will continue to work in supported Xbox 360 games and will be accessible via the Xbox Original Avatars app.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One way or another, Avatars feel less and less important these days. In its FAQ, Xbox said that it was ending support due to "low engagement" and a "shift in focus toward delivering other player experiences," noting that players can still personalize their experience with dynamic backgrounds, profile colors, and other options. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, Xbox is looking ahead to the future, among other things working on a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-handheld-what-i-want-to-see-from-microsofts-portable-console">dedicated handheld</a>.

Those mad lads, they actually did it. </h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you logged onto social media this morning and wondered why "HE HAS A GUN" and "HE PISSED ON THE MOON" were trending, let me reassure you: that it an extremely normal thing to wonder. And the answer? A new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-shows-off-the-films-take-on-chao-garden-in-all-its-glory">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 trailer debuted this morning</a>, of course. What, that wasn't obvious?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/25/image-115-1732561348228.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A look at this morning's trends after the latest Sonic the Hedgehog 3 trailer.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest look at the highly anticipated threequel gave us quite a bit, actually, including glimpses of the Chuck E. Cheese-like take on Chao Garden and more shenanigans from Jim Carrey's Dr. Robotnik. But, most importantly, according to <em>a lot</em> of Sonic fans on social media today: they gave Shadow a gun. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/25/shadow-1732563043166.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Shadow with a gun. That's it, that's all this is. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid the various looks at Sonic v. Shadow action in the trailer, we get a quick glimpse of Shadow (who will be voiced here by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-voice-casting">none other than Keanu Reeves</a>) with, yes, a gun. Shadow <em>has</em> packed heat in one video game before — in his own 2005 title, Shadow the Hedgehog — but it's pretty safe to say that fans didn't expect to see that represented in Paramount's film series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"HE HAS A GUN, THIS SH*T MEANS SOMETHING TO ME MAN," wrote @UltimaShadowX on <a href="https://x.com/UltimaShadowX/status/1861048213752426880" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>. <a href="https://x.com/beliyaal/status/1861059115381858801" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Others jumped in</a> with cries of "THEY DID IT THEY ACTUALLY DID IT" and "oh sh*t I'm definitely passing out," while some streamers posted their live surprised reactions.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">HE HAS A GUN.

"I’m sorry I can’t get over the fact that he has a gun," <a href="https://x.com/ShadowxTwilight/status/1861068400295878853" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote one fan</a>. "It is so crazy to me that they actually are acknowledging Shadow 05 even in the movie. I never thought I’d see such a positive appreciation for him again."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/ratedT_7/status/1861059141730459750" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another fan</a> pointed out that he also appeared to be riding the bike from the 2005 game. "References to shadow 2005 is so crazyyy," <a href="https://x.com/stranger_bear_/status/1861102204771357062" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one added</a>. "THEY COOKED SO HAAARD"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and in case you're wondering about the "pissed on the moon" thing: there was a shot in the trailer of a laser being shot at the moon, which many have taken as a reference to a famous Sonic meme. In a popular YouTube video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A45CznHpEzk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SnapCube</a> (NSFW audio at that link), a man dubs over for Dr. Robotnik in a cutscene from Sonic Adventure 2, saying he would urinate on the moon as a laser hits it. Look, there's a lot of lore in the Sonic fanbase and not all of it makes sense, but that's what we love about it.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though the famous Sega character has only used guns in one game, "Shadow with a gun" has long been important to the fanbase. We're sure you've <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/177g7w8/say_what_you_want_about_it_this_shi_was_ahead_of/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seen the memes</a>. Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka, however, recently told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/shadow-doesnt-need-a-gun-he-is-a-weapon-sonic-team-talks-shadow-generations/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Video Games Chronicle</a> that there's a good chance we won't see Shadow with guns in a game again. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we talk about Shadow, he would use whatever he needed in the moment to get the job done. So he would pick up a gun or ride a bike in order to get the job done – he’s that kind of character," he said at at the time. "But he’s also extremely powerful on his own and doesn’t really need a gun or anything because he can do it himself – he is a weapon. So as long as there’s no need for Shadow to use a gun, he will probably not use one."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, at least fans who <em>do</em> want to see that have the movie, which speeds into theaters <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-release-date-cast-story-trailer-details">on December 20</a>. For more in the meantime, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-movie-review">our review of Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>, which we said "brings all the humor and charm of its predecessor, while also being delightfully more loyal to its source material."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.
