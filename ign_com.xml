He was 55 years old.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the NBC report, "the single-car crash was reported at about 12:45 p.m. on the scenic road north of Los Angeles in the San Gabriel Mountains. The southbound car veered off the road, hit a concrete barrier and a passenger was ejected, the California Highway Patrol said. The driver was trapped in the ensuing car fire, the CHP said. The driver died at the scene and the passenger died at a hospital, authorities told NBC4 Investigates."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">NBC has updated its story to note that Zampella was the driver and the vehicle was a 2026 Ferrari 296 GTS, and that an eyewitness provided video of the crash to authorities. The passenger has not yet been publicly identified.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zampella was an incredibly talented game developer who changed the industry with Call of Duty, a franchise he co-created with Jason West in 2003 at Infinity Ward, the studio he co-founded with West after previously serving as the lead designer for EA's Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. Zampella was at the center of a high-profile <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/03/04/infinity-ward-founders-file-lawsuit-against-activision">lawsuit</a> against Activision that alleged that the publisher owed Zampella and the Infinity Ward team millions of dollars in unpaid Call of Duty royalties. The bitter professional divorce led to Zampella and West taking a substantial number of the Infinity Ward team with them to EA, where they co-founded Respawn Entertainment, a studio that has produced nothing but critically acclaimed hits: Titanfall (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/10/titanfall-review-2">IGN review</a>), Titanfall 2 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review">IGN review</a>), Apex Legends (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-review-2">IGN review</a>), Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review">IGN review</a>), and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review">IGN review</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Respawn's success under Zampella led to him getting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2020/01/02/respawn-ceo-vince-zampella-takes-over-dice-la-plans-studio-name-change-unannounced-game">promoted</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vince-zampella-battlefield">twice</a>, eventually overseeing the Battlefield franchise within his role as Group General Manager at EA.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">IN PICTURES: Call of Duty Co-Creator and Respawn Co-Founder Vince Zampella, Who Has Died Aged 55</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA issued IGN the following statement:</p><blockquote>This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work. Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Infinity Ward, the studio Zampella left to found Respawn, issued a statement of its own. In <a href="https://x.com/InfinityWard/status/2003224882688283000" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on Twitter / X</a>, the Activision-owned Call of Duty developer said: "Rest in peace Vince.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-ex-just-cause-devs-samson-aims-to-be-like-mad-maxpayne</link>
            <guid>1390576</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">All it took for Samson to pique my curiosity was <a href="https://x.com/LiquidSwords/status/1983169469804622067" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a very brief teaser</u></a> on social media, and then <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/1983224388095799355" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a follow-up post</u></a> by the game director that described it “more like Mad Max…Payne” meant it had my attention. And then, once it was officially <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/samson-a-tyndalston-story-official-announcement-trailer"><u>announced</u></a> earlier this month, my interest immediately skyrocketed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a gritty crime drama being developed by Liquid Swords, a team made up of a number of former Just Cause developers. It’s due out early in 2026 on PC for $25, with console versions planned for later release. In it, you play Samson McCray, who finds himself in the city of Tyndalston after a job he was the getaway driver for went bad in St. Louis. His sister, Oonagh, had warned him not to take the job, and sure enough she was right. But she managed to cut a deal with the St. Louis crew: Samson has to pay back what was lost, with interest. And that’s where this game begins: with our titular anti-hero staring down a debt that’s accruing interest every day, needing to take whatever jobs he can in order to whittle the debt down.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is hand-to-hand. Health pickups are bottles of painkillers (hello, Max Payne!), you’ll do plenty of driving (hello, Mad Max!). And the world, says studio founder and game director Christofer Sundberg, will “push back” on your action. “We've had this motto from the beginning that the city is a character in itself,” he explained. “So the more you poke around, the more the world will react. Interacting with people on the street, objects, doing stuff that is unexpected to the world – it's quite a depressing town. The world will react. We have a special narrative around law enforcement and why guns are exclusive to law enforcement and really hardened criminals. And the world remembers what you've done. You won't get away with everything. There will be a reaction to your actions.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The more you poke around, the more the world will react.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and about that “more like Mad Max…Payne” comment? When asked to elaborate on that, Sundberg told me, “[Some of] the team that worked on the Mad Max is working on Samson, and we're taking that [experience] ten years in the future. The tone is equally dark as Mad Max. It's not a post-apocalyptic world. [And] one of the greatest urban game stories ever told is Max Payne. [So] I guess it's the tone that I'm after.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Samson Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Samson originally had a much larger scope with a much larger team. But in early 2025, Sundberg and studio leadership made the difficult decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>lay off approximately half of the team</u></a>.”We made a very tough decision to scale down the team due to market conditions and how much trouble the industry is in right now. It stung a lot to have to let them go and it also meant that we had to change our focus. We shelved more of the heavier RPG stuff we worked on – our version of base-building – because we didn't have the bandwidth anymore.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so, the team that remains, it meant trying to deliver a narrower-but-still-deep experience. “It was originally a 100-hour experience. Now it's more of a quick-and-dirty session-based experience. Completionists will get to spend at least 25 hours. But we are very respectful of people's time.” And that reduced scope is reflected in the $25 price point, too. “We see this as the first book in a series of books to be told about the city and character.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/22/liquidswords-samson-handtohandcombat-03-1766431609313.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's tiny compared to Just Cause 2, but it's dense,” he continued. “The size of the world isn't the issue, it's more about how we fill it with meaningful content. We always say that it's ‘big enough’ and it's very scalable.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting back to gameplay, Sundberg says Samson is inspired tonally by films like Heat, Ronin, French Connection – stories, in his words, “where violence is fast and decisive.” And that influence is pretty clear on the screen. Samson looked to my eye like it was set in the 1970s, but Sundberg says it is in fact the ‘90s, chosen specifically for the layer of grit the decade still had caked on it. “We played around with the identity era crisis that the '90s was. Cell phones didn't really exist but they were still around. Cash was still king and people were still smoking.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/22/liquidswords-samson-handtohandcombat-04-1766431609314.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I saw a mission played where Samson wandered outside into a seedy neighborhood. He jumped into a muscle car and drove to a mission waypoint that offered $1000 to be a getaway driver. After switching cars and meeting at the pickup point – in an industrial area that was still very seedy – the planned burglary happens, the building’s alarm goes off, your crewmates get in, and you have to escape the pursuing police. The extra wrinkle is that the cops have a helicopter looking for you too, so it means you’ll need to work extra hard to shake them. After plenty of driving around – Tyndalston seems fairly large, but again, don’t expect it to be jammed full of open-world activities to do – you eventually duck off a road in an alley, under an overpass, turn off your headlights, and lose the pursuing police. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This beatdown earned us $1000 to knock off of Samson’s debt.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The next mission I saw was a hit that tasked me with going into a club called Chubb’s, finding the manager, and having to fight my way through – sometimes bare-knuckled, and sometimes with a crowbar in hand. Eventually you can build up your adrenaline meter and trigger an adrenaline rush, allowing you to hit harder for a short period of time. This beatdown earned us $1000 to knock off of Samson’s debt.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/22/liquidswords-samson-city-04-1766431609313.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Though my demo was brief – maybe 15 minutes or so – I saw enough to really like how Samson is shaping up. The Liquid Swords team is seemingly aiming to deliver a AAA experience at a AA scope and price (there’s more info in an FAQ on the <u>Steam page</u> if you’re interested). If they can pull it off, then Samson has a chance to be well worth its low asking price.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-ex-just-cause-devs-samson-aims-to-be-like-mad-maxpayne]]></content:encoded>
