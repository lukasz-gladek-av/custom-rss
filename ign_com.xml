In news unlikely to surprise you, we thought GTA 5 was "preposterously enjoyable, breathtaking in scope, and bitingly funny." <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-v-review"><u>It returned a 10/10</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-confirms-playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-november-2025"><u>Don't forget, you have until December 1 to grab November's free monthly games</u></a>: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/stray"><u>Stray</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ea-sports-wrc"><u>EA Sports WRC 24</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/totally-accurate-battle-simulator"><u>Totally Accurate Battle Simulator</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ICYMI, yes, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026"><u>Grand Theft Auto VI has been delayed until November 19, 2026</u></a>. This news was announced yesterday, November 6, by Rockstar as a part of parent company Take-Two's second-quarter earnings. In a release shared with IGN, Take-Two said the delay was about "giving the team some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve. Rockstar has our full support of course, and we are confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>GTA 6</u></a> was originally announced for a fall 2025 release, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-insists-it-wont-release-gta-6-and-borderlands-4-close-to-each-other"><u>CEO Strauss Zelnick said he felt confident in</u></a>, even amid speculation of a delay.
