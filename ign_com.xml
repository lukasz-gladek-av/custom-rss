During his mission, he gets infected with a Technocyte Virus that turns him into a killing machine with powers and a deadly glaive that he must use to save everything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/03/25/dark-sector-review-2">Dark Sector review,</a> we said, "Dark Sector's fun. Hearing guards scream for help just before they take a glaive to the face, marching around in this Metal Gear-looking Jackal tank while rocketing bad guys into the air and wielding a pimped-out shotgun make the experience something any action fan can get behind. However, when the really similar levels and waves of opponents get too repetitive towards the end of the game, Dark Sector's weak storyline might not be enough to carry the more fickle fan to the finish line. It's fun, but it's not perfect."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for how Dark Sector is connected to Warframe: 1999, the expansion will take players to the year before Y2K and a retro European-style city of HÃ¶llvania to become Arthur Nightingale. This is obviously a far cry from the space setting Warframe fans are used to, but it should be an exciting one.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/warframe-1999-new-zone-unlikely-inspiration-dark-sector" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VG247,</a> creative director Rebecca Ford shared that Dark Sector was definitely an inspiration for this expansion and the team looked to the game for its tone and a city that felt European. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Have a tip for us?
