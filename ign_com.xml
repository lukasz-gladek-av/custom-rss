The Pokémon Company has already revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-pokemon-game-pokemon-presents-2024">a spin-off title in Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, which is due out in 2025, but the next official "generation" of Pokémon has yet to be mentioned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These events also typically include updates on Pokémon's other ongoing games, such as Pokémon Unite, Pokémon Sleep, Pokémon GO, and Pokémon Masters EX. We're also likely to hear about the more recently released Pokémon TCG Pocket, as well as the physical card game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-presents-february-2024-everything-announced">The last Pokémon Presents took place last year around this time</a> and revealed the new Legends game, Tera Raid Battle events coming to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, word on the Pokémon Trading Card Game coming to mobile, and more. Unlike past years which had multiple events, 2024 only had one Pokémon Presents, and also was the first year since 2015 to skip having a major Pokémon game release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
