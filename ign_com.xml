            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We want to make sure that the full experience is optimized."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard has said that its Warcraft-themed collectible card game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft"><u>Hearthstone</u></a> is still not available on consoles because the team needs "a level of investment... to make that happen."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's according to executive producer Nathan Lyons-Smith, who recently revealed that because of the 12-year-old game's aging code — estimated to be 16 years old — any port to console must be done "right" and only when the team finds "the right time to do it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's a level of investment that we need to make that happen, primarily in terms of UI and UX, and making sure that it's very natural to go and play a card game on those platforms," Lyons-Smith said, as reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hearthstone-isnt-on-console-switch-or-steam-deck-but-increasingly-likely-to-happen" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Eurogamer</u></a>. "I know it's possible — Duels of the Planeswalkers for Magic [The Gathering], many years ago now, was absolutely delightful with the controller — so I know we can do it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I asked an engineer who'd been on the project a long time, and he estimates the code is 16 years old," Lyons-Smith continued, "and the team was 15 people 16 years ago. And so there's more of an effort to go: 'I want to make sure when we go that it's awesome.' That it doesn't just feel like, yeah, they ported it here, and you can play... </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I want to make sure that when we go, we're going to go, and it's going to feel awesome for players that love that form factor, whether they're leaning back on the couch or sitting on the couch with their handheld."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hearthstone originally launched in 2014 on PC, with a mobile and tablet version following very shortly after. Over the years there have been numerous calls for the game to launch on consoles — and particularly Nintendo Switch, for handheld play. But Blizzard has never gotten around to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Game director Tyler Bielman added: "If we're going to bring it specifically to that living room big screen platform, we would want to make sure that the full experience is optimized for that mode that you're in."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, of course, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-activision-blizzard-buy-acquisition-acquired">Blizzard owned by Xbox and parent company Microsoft</a>, there could be more pressure than ever to bring the hugely-successful card game to console players. However, with Xbox's high-level goal of enabling gamers to play "anywhere," the Hearthstone team acknowledged an expectation to go "as wide as we could" to reach as many players as possible, regardless of platform. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In the future, as we explore console and handheld, we'd probably go as wide as we could," Lyons-Smith added. "Certainly, we have a different owner now than we did three years ago, and they're more invested in Xbox and 'anything's an Xbox'. Their high-level goal [being] games playable anywhere."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hearthstone's <a href="https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24242864/your-guide-to-cataclysm-card-reveals-and-free-rewards-in-the-dragon-s-hoard" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cataclysm-themed expansion</a> is set to launch on March 17, marking the return of Colossal cards and introducing a brand new story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

He did, however, stress that this will be the "final update" for the monster hunting game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are currently at work on a large-scale expansion similar to Monster Hunter World: Iceborne and Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak for Monster Hunter: Wilds," Tsujimoto said. "We plan to share more information with you this summer."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We also learned a little more about the update dropping on February 18, too, including details of Arch-Tempered Arkveld, 10-star Arc-Tempered monsters, a special collaboration with Monster Hunter Stories 3 — a spin-off series that releases next month — plus an anniversary event where all previous awards and quests will be "re-available."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players who log in during the anniversary event will receive a free item pack, and each previous seasonal event will return for a weekly rotation. "Almost all" previously released event quests will be made permanent from February 18.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have been implementing improvements to game stability and performance since Title Update 4," Tsujimoto added, "and this update will introduce even further improvements." Again, we're told to expect more details closer to the time, so Capcom suggests you monitor its social media accounts for updates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While this marks the end of major content updates, the team is currently hard at work on a large-scale expansion to Monster Hunter Wilds," the team added. "We look forward to sharing the first reveal of the expansion this summer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds has had something of a bumpy ride of late. Title Update 4 arrived at the end of last year and ushered in a long list of gameplay and balance changes, as well as CPU/GPU improvements, load reduction, and the optimization of "PC-specific processes and addition of options and presets to reduce processing load." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A development roadmap, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-sets-out-roadmap-to-improve-performance-on-pc-starting-with-title-update-4"><u>detailed in December</u></a>, mentioned plans to address the myriad issues impacting the PC version. However, just last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/more-dlc-more-fps-monster-hunter-wilds-players-ask-capcom-for-answers-after-theory-suggests-a-backend-dlc-check-is-tanking-performance"><u>one player believed they had discovered that PC performance was dictated by the number of DLCs a user has</u></a>. Capcom looked into it and concluded they were right, calling it "an unintended bug" that would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-drops-monster-hunter-wilds-patch-that-aims-to-improve-optimization-for-steam-specific-processes-and-address-long-standing-pc-issues"><u>resolved with Patch 1.040.03.01</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
