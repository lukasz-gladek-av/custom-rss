Jayson Rothwell will write the screenplay, although there are no plot details yet. Nor is there a release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the Sega side, Toru Nakahara, who worked on the Sonic movies, is a producer, and Sega America and Europe CEO Shuji Utsumi will oversee the film.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">OutRun began life in 1986 as a graphically impressive arcade driving game designed by Sega developer legend Yu Suzuki. It’s seen numerous versions and ports over the years, with a proper sequel released in 2003, but has been somewhat dormant in recent times. The most recent release came in 2009 with Sumo Digital's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/outrun-online-arcade">OutRun Online Arcade</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega, however, has dipped into its back catalogue for inspiration, with new Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, Golden Axe, Virtua Fighter, and Shinobi games all in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has also pushed adaptations of its coveted IP. The Sonic movies are of course hugely popular, and an adaptation of Like a Dragon: Yakuza launched last year on Amazon. Hollywood is keen for more video game films, with The Super Mario Bros. Movie and the recently released A Minecraft Movie breaking records.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what sort of film OutRun will be, perhaps Bay and Sweeney invisage a Fast &amp; Furious-style driving and action flick.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The series is best known for its deep narratives, excellent turn-based combat, and beloved characters. However, it's hard not to argue that the Persona franchise has grown as much as it has thanks to its music. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to purchasing video game soundtracks, what better way to enjoy them than on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-bluetooth-record-players">vinyl</a>? Many of the Persona soundtracks were quite hard to obtain on vinyl previously, whether due to high prices or limited availability. Now, however, iam8bit and Atlus have teamed up once more to create brand-new, moderately priced releases that you can now pre-order at IGN Store.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Check Out The Persona Vinyl Collection at IGN Store!</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">First up, you can pre-order the entire <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review">Persona 3 Reload</a> soundtrack on Vinyl with the 4xLP release, featuring Holographic Broken Glass Vinyl. Additionally, the entire <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/20/persona-q-shadow-of-the-labyrinth-review">Persona Q - Shadow of the Labyrinth</a> soundtrack can be pre-ordered as a 4xLP as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, three brand-new vinyl releases are available to pre-order. iam8bit unveiled Megamix versions of Persona 3 Reload, Persona 4, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/29/persona-5-review">Persona 5</a>. These new releases pack in the very best tracks from each of these games into one 1xLP vinyl for only $29.99. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, you can pre-order the 3xLP release for Persona 4 Arena and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/30/persona-4-arena-ultimax-review">Persona 4 Arena Ultimax</a>. As the fighting game spin-off of Persona 4, you can expect a much heavier and fun spin on iconic tracks like Reach Out To The Truth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of these Persona vinyl are quickly selling at IGN Store, so be sure to secure your treasure while you still can!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-requests-subpoena-of-discord-to-track-down-user-behind-last-years-pokemon-teraleak<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is requesting a subpoena from a California court that, if granted, would force Discord to give it information about the identity of the person behind last year's massive Pokemon leak, known as the "FreakLeak" or the "TeraLeak".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to court documents <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/561817/pokemon-teraleak-nintendo-discord-subpoena" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seen and reported on by Polygon</a>, Nintendo is requesting the courts order Discord to proide the name, address, phone number, and email address of a Discord user known as "GameFreakOUT". Last October, GameFreakOUT is alleged to have posted content including copyright-protected artwork, characters, source code, and other materials related to pokemon to a Discord server called "FreakLeak," after which they were distributed widely across the internet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though not confirmed, the materials were likely obtained in a data breach back in August that Game Freak <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-developer-game-freak-reportedly-hacked-stolen-data-on-unannounced-games-as-well-as-nintendo-switch-2-codename-leaked-online">disclosed the following October. </a>Per Game Freak, the data breach included 2,606 cases of current, former, and contract employee names being accessed. Oddly, leaked files began appearing online on October 12, and Game Freak's statement appeared online the following day, but was backdated to October 10 and does not mention confidential company materials beyond employee information.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The leaked materials included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-developer-game-freak-reportedly-hacked-stolen-data-on-unannounced-games-as-well-as-nintendo-switch-2-codename-leaked-online">numerous unannounced projects</a>, as well as cut content and other background information and early builds of other Pokemon games. Notably, the leak unveiled Pokemon Champions, an upcoming battle-focused Pokemon game, prior to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-champions-game-freaks-leaked-multiplayer-game-officially-revealed">game's official announcement in February</a>. It also contained information about the upcoming Pokemon Legends: Z-A that has since been proven correct, alongside yet-to-be-proven information on the next generation of Pokemon, source code for various DS pokemon titles, meeting summaries, and cut lore from Pokemon Legends: Arceus and other games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has not yet filed suit against a hacker or leaker in response, but given the subpoena it seems likely Nintendo is trying to find the identity of the person responsible in hopes of doing so. Nintendo historically has been highly litigious about everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamer-sent-nintendo-a-letter-boasting-he-had-a-thousand-burner-channels-to-stream-pirated-nintendo-games-from-and-could-do-this-all-day-now-nintendo-has-sued-him-for-millions-of-dollars">piracy</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-officially-suing-palworld-developer-over-multiple-patent-infringements">patent infringement</a>, so if the subpoena is granted, it is perhaps only a matter of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
