Preorders at Target are already sold out as well, while Best Buy’s selection is merely marked as “Coming Soon”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that, outside of keeping up with deal trackers, you’ll very more than likely have to pay above retail price for the time being. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, we’ll give you a full breakdown of the best places to get your buy for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/pokemon"><u>Pokémon</u></a> preorders for whichever Mega Evolution: Ascended Heroes products you’re looking out for. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ascended Heroes Tech Sticker Collection — Charmander &amp; Ghastly</h2><div id="234434"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234434" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Evolution: Ascended Heroes Tech Sticker Collection - Charmander - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><div id="234435"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234435" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Evolution: Ascended Heroes Tech Sticker Collection - Gastly - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Only a handful of Pokémon TCG products for the Ascended Heroes expansion are launching right away on 30 January, with the Charmander and Ghastly Tech Collections preorders being the best to buy first — the cheapest being at Walmart for $39.97 each (random), or at <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqJVNw?object_uuid=289eb6e5-519f-468b-9e7b-aed2f1917205&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Amazon </u></a>for around $43 each. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each collection gets you three Ascended Heroes booster packs, a titular promo card, and a tech sticker sheet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pre-orders for individual Ascended Heroes booster packs are sold out over at <a href="https://zdcs.link/QV5AP7?object_uuid=289eb6e5-519f-468b-9e7b-aed2f1917205&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGplayer</u></a> and aren’t listed at Amazon or Walmart, so the Tech Sticker Collections give you the best value for money.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ascended Heroes Collection Blisters — Erika &amp; Larry</h2></div><div id="234443"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234443" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Evolution: Ascended Heroes Collection - Larry - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the first Ascended Heroes products releasing with the set’s launch on 30 January, the Erika and Larry blister packs are arguably the second-hottest to buy right now —  and pre-orders can be bought cheapest for <a href="https://zdcs.link/a56y15?object_uuid=289eb6e5-519f-468b-9e7b-aed2f1917205&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>$34.99 at Amazon</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, whichever one you get between the Larry and Erika edition (Larry’s has a Komala promo card, and Erika’s with Tangela).

In the meantime, though, Walmart’s the best go-to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

Maisy the Cow? We're less sure about that last one.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here, Geralt's quests are retold as plays by Dandelion, who holds the hero's fate in his hands. Whether sticking to the facts or stretching the truth, you'll need to keep Geralt's infamy in balance to ensure your run continues for as long as possible. And while your adventures with Geralt are likely to end in many deaths, each run will reward you with songbooks to perform on ever grander stages in the hope of ultimately reaching narrative immortality. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reigns: The Witcher is developed by Reigns series developer Nerial, and set for launch on February 25 for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1651600/Reigns_The_Witcher/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> and on mobile via Google Play and the iPhone App Store. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of Reigns: The Witcher this spring feels well-timed, amid a temporary lull in the launch of CD Projekt's bestselling series.

It's a mixture of cinematics and gameplay. Check it out above. And if you know anything about this universe, you probably won't be surprised that the Orks are literally driven by mayhem and sporting a reckless, no-nonsense offensive playstyle. What you may not have been expecting is the scale of the carnage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In particular, we get a great look at the Ork superunit, the Gorkanaut, which can crumple up dreadnoughts and go toe-to-toe with the likes of an Imperial Knight. Towering over the battlefield at a scale that sets Dawn of War apart from its predecessors, the number of guns on this thing could be described as both bewildering and hilarious. And that's just what the Orks are about.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dawn of War 4 has been our IGN First "cover story" all January long.
