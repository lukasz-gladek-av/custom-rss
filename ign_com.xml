Nintendo has announced Fire Emblem Shadows, a new free-to-play smartphone game that's available right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released overnight for both iOS and Android devices, Fire Emblem Shadows mixes the series' traditional tactical role-playing gameplay with social deduction elements. Which one of your team of heroes is secretly a traitor? Or will you choose the path of shadow yourself?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fire Emblem Shadows is a surprising announcement from Nintendo, which has not launched a new smartphone game in years, since its collaboration with Pokémon Go creator Niantic back in 2021 to launch Pikmin Bloom. That said, Nintendo's previous Fire Emblem Heroes mobile game was incredibly lucrative — launched in 2017 with gacha-powered gameplay, it earned over $650 million in three years — so a fresh spin-off would make sense.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Fire Emblem Shadows (@FE_Shadows_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/FE_Shadows_EN/status/1970998782474227852?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"Choose light or shadow, then engage in strategic combat featuring two disciples of light and one disciple of shadow," reads the game's blurb. "After an initial battle, players vote to determine who they believe is the treacherous disciple of shadow. Whether the disciples of light can correctly discover the traitor — or the disciple of shadow can successfully deceive the others — will dictate how the next battle unfolds. Expect the unexpected and be wary of enemies and allies alike."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Artwork shows light and shadow versions of familiar characters such as Lyn, who is available during the game's launch season and will be unlocked faster if you upgrade to a premium version of the game's first battle pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you fancy giving it a go, you can get the download started from the iPhone <a href="https://t.co/JqUFsvdb5U" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a> or <a href="https://t.co/Iy3AsoNjF2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a> now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since their announcement, Switch 2 Game-Key Cards have kindled much discussion and provoked strong opinions from gamers and developers alike. Latest to weigh in on Nintendo’s controversial format is Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi. He implied that developers are choosing Game-Key Cards not necessarily from a cost perspective, but a performance one, as the format enables them to bring smoother-running games to the Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Switch 2 Game-key cards are physical, they only contain a key, which requires the user to download the actual game from Nintendo’s online store. As Morningstar analyst Kazunori Ito recently summed up to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-23/nintendo-s-switch-2-sales-boom-fails-to-ease-game-developers-gloom?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1ODYyOTA2MiwiZXhwIjoxNzU5MjMzODYyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMzFHMDJHUFdDVFowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.ZGnG8_5dKGMsGf2fJii9xwn7A_1_oZatFwdPzCAXhjs&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg</u></a>: “The key card feels rather half-baked as it combines the drawbacks of both the physical and digital versions.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite also attracting criticism from a game preservation standpoint (see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-a-little-disheartening-the-thing-remastered-dev-says"><u>Nightdive CEO Stephen Kick</u></a>’s comments, for example), some developers have recently spoken out in favor of the Game-Key Card format, the latest being Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking through an interpreter during a recent interview with German news site <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/final-fantasy-director-hofft-dass-ihr-game-key-cards-eines-tages-moegen-koennt/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>JP Games</u></a>, Hamaguchi said that he understood why the Switch 2 Game-Key Card format is disliked. “I really get where people are coming from in terms of their negativity towards it, and there are good reasons,” he said. However, discussion between developers on the topic is “perhaps a bit different to what the fans maybe expect.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will make its Switch 2 debut on January 22, 2026. However, the game will only be released on a Game-key card, and there are reasons for this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hamaguchi explained that the major issues for those who want to release high-end, demanding games like Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on the Switch 2 is the limited memory of the cards and their slower loading speed (in comparison to consoles with disc-based games, like PS5 and Xbox Series X and S). The smaller memory size of the cards is something that “developers can’t ignore (...) we have to work around that.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 Game-Key Card, however, helps developers to circumnavigate around these restrictions. Hamaguchi added that Game-Key Cards can make it possible for developers to do “a semi-download version of the game,” utilizing the Switch 2’s internal storage, which can load games faster than if they were being loaded completely from the card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over at Ubisoft, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-developer-defends-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-says-cartridges-that-force-you-to-download-the-game-are-better-for-loading"><u>Star Wars Outlaws’ developer Rob Bantin also recently defended Game-Key Cards</u></a> from a similar standpoint, citing performance as a major reason for going down this route: “(regular) Switch 2 cards simply didn't give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In defense of the format, Hamaguchi said that he’d like for “Nintendo fans to understand the Game-Key cards and maybe come to accept them as part of the culture of gaming on Switch. (...) From a developer’s perspective, it allows us to bring more high-end experiences to Switch players, and I think that’s a good thing (...) (it lets) us do things that maybe we wouldn’t otherwise.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This echoes previous <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-switch-2-game-key-cards-help-third-party-publishers-bring-deeper-larger-and-more-immersive-content-on-the-platform"><u>remarks from Nintendo of America CEO Doug Bowser</u></a>, who suggested that Game-Key cards help third party publishers to release bigger and more ambitious games on the Switch 2: “Game-Key Cards are a way that our publishing partners are able to bring more content onto the platform- deeper and larger, more immersive content.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.
