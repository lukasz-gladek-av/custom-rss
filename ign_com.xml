"In a world where everything we did 10 years ago was about selling shiny discs in plastic boxes in retail shelves — well, that’s still a <em>part</em> of our business, it’s a significantly smaller part of our business, and we now have pricing representing everything from free-to-play all the way to deluxe editions and beyond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At the end of the day, whether we're doing something that costs a dollar, or we're doing something that costs $10, or we're doing something that costs $100, our objective is always to deliver incredible quality and exponential value for our playerbase," said Wilson. "And what we've discovered over the course of time is [when] we can marry quality and value together, our business is strong, resilient, and continues to grow."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"From a guidance perspective [...] we have reflected no changes in our current [pricing] strategy at this point," added CFO Stuart Canfield.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It'll be welcome news to some, given just last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raises-the-price-of-all-xbox-series-consoles-xbox-games-confirmed-to-hit-80-this-holiday"><u>Microsoft confirmed it was raising Xbox prices</u></a> as well as increasing the cost of controllers, headsets, and some games. The price hike for consoles and accessories has already taken effect, and while game prices will stay the same for now, we should expect to see Xbox charging $79.99 for new, first-party games around the holiday season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It follows a broader trend in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raising-prices-new-first-party-games-xbox-series-70-2023-redfall-starfield"><u>AAA gaming that has seen prices jumping from $60 to $70</u></a> in just the last five years, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy"><u>Nintendo going with $80 for upcoming Switch 2 exclusive Mario Kart World and some other Switch 2 Edition games</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-s-tier-rank-every-rockstar-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Which Rockstar game do you think is the greatest?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new GTA 6 trailer is here and, in case you missed it, we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2"><u>broke down all of the secrets and details</u></a> from it. Sadly, though, we’re going to have to wait until May 26, 2026, to actually play Lucia and Jason’s story. So, in the meantime, why don’t we think about all of the Rockstar games we’ve already enjoyed over the years and rank them for fun?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has developed and released over 30 games since its creation in 1998, and is responsible for famous series such as Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, and Manhunt. But which comes out on top? Just to clarify, you won’t see the likes of LA Noire or Max Payne 2 here, as we’ve strictly gone with Rockstar-developed games, rather than ones the studio has published. I’ve had a go at ranking them via one of our IGN Tier Lists, purely taking into account my personal enjoyment of each game over the years. Take a look at my tier list here:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/07/screenshot-2025-05-07-at-12-08-59-1746616161781.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Dead Redemption 2 is simply my favourite game of all time, so it was a pretty easy S-tier pick for me if I’m honest. It’s (perhaps unsurprisingly) joined its predecessor and GTA 5 in that category – both pioneers of the cinematic open world genre. I also have a particular soft spot for Max Payne 3 and its bullet time ballet, as well as GTA San Andreas (a game I played at a way too young age). Down at the bottom in the D-tier, we have the likes of Austin Powers: Oh, Behave! and Welcome to My Underground Lair!, a game that literally nobody in their right mind wants to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t agree with me? Think that Vice City is better than GTA 4? Well, why not have a go at ranking all of Rockstar’s games yourself in a tier list below, where you can compare your own S, A, B, C, and D tiers with the whole of the IGN community.</p><div id="every-rockstar-game-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3><h3>Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We may have only seen two trailers so far, but where do you think GTA 6 will end up ranking when all is said and done? Let us know in the comments, as well as why you’ve ranked the games in the order you’ve chosen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

Eagle-eyed fans spotted that the presidents on the cash seen in a screenshot of the club in GTA 6 are the same as those from Red Dead Redemption 2’s cigarette cards (Thaddeus Waxman and Franklin Hardin).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting this is an incidental detail, and GTA and Red Dead existing in the same universe does not amount to much at the end of the day (although some are now suggesting Jason may be a descendant of Arthur Morgan, given the two look sort of alike). But it shows that there are connections between the two Rockstar IPs that may be strengthened further when GTA 6 comes out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now onto some juicy stuff. There is a brief moment in the trailer early on when Jason walks into his house, and the camera moves into what looks like an over the shoulder, third-person perspective. There is little sign of gameplay in Trailer 2, but fans are theorizing that this cutscene may seamlessly transition into the beginning of GTA 6, with players thrust into controlling Jason as he walks around his house.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If true, it may be the case that GTA 6 features two of these sections: one for Jason and one for Lucia, the game’s second playable protagonist. The theory here is that GTA 6 will feature a similar transition into gameplay moment for Lucia, helping the player get to grips with the dual protagonist gameplay ahead of the time-skip to when Lucia leaves prison.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on, fans are focusing their attention on an image transition on the recently updated official GTA 6 website, which sees the camera swing around from spotlighting Jason to spotlighting Lucia as they share an embrace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are wondering if this is a character select screen that might display when you load the game. The expectation is you’ll be able to swap between Jason and Lucia during gameplay, but perhaps GTA 6 gives you the chance to pick between the two upon getting back into the game, and if so, this could be what we’ll see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are all sorts of theories on the nature of Jason and Lucia’s relationship and where the story will take it. I’ve seen everything from speculation that Jason is an undercover cop to either Jason or Lucia or perhaps even both dying at the end of the story. Most seem convinced either Jason or Lucia betrays the other at some point, which would be criminal. Perhaps we’ll get to choose via an optional ending system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just a note on the Jason is a cop theory: Jason tells the prison security guard, when picking up Lucia, that he might have been there before. In what capacity? Later, an older cop says, “Us cops, we’ve got to protect each other,” before the trailer cuts to Jason shooting at a moving car.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This leads on to a theory that GTA 6 may feature a third playable character that Rockstar is keeping secret so it’s a surprise to fans, and that this older cop may be it. Could you shift perspective to a cop hunting down Jason and Lucia during the story?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, this is a brilliantly silly fan theory: previous GTA games are <em>films</em> in the world of GTA 6. Phil Cassidy, the arms dealer from Vice City and GTA 3, is at the heart of this theory. In those games he’s missing an arm, but there is a character seen on Jason’s TV during the GTA 6 trailer that looks a lot like Cassidy — except he has both arms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s happening here? If this is indeed Cassidy, then how does he have both arms? Could the GTA 6 Cassidy be Phil Cassidy’s son? Or his grandson?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adding to the confusion is GTA's seperated universes structure. The GTA series is divided into three distinct parallel universes, officially named by Rockstar North as the "2D Universe", "3D Universe," and the "HD Universe."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2D Universe includes the original top-down GTA games developed by DMA Design. The 3D Universe starts with GTA 3 and includes its prequels, such as Vice City. And the HD Universe starts with GTA 4 and includes GTA 5, GTA Online, and the upcoming GTA 6, with each game set in the same year it was released. Following this, GTA 6 will be set in 2026, aka the modern day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, while these are meant to be distinct parallel universes, there is a lot of crossover between them, with shared place names, characters, some lore, and more besides. But certainly no-one was expecting Phil Cassidy from Vice City to pop up in GTA 6, as it makes the 'distinct parallel universes' thing even trickier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, perhaps having GTA’s 3D Universe games as films in the ongoing HD Universe would help resolve these issues. We do see what looks like Phil Cassidy on Jason's TV, after all. Or, this Phil Cassidy has nothing more than a fun Easter egg Rockstar added to GTA 6 to spark exactly this kind of speculation. This is Rockstar, after all!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trailer 2 has also reinforced existing theories that GTA 6 will feature heists, and that there is a heavy influence from the Fast &amp; Furious movies. At one point we see a truck with a vault attached to it, similar to the Fast 5 scene that does pretty much the same thing.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Marvrassiczilla 🅰️🦖🦎🦍 (@Movie__Fans) <a href="https://twitter.com/Movie__Fans/status/1919772545617952866?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">More GTA 6 fan theories are popping up all the time as people dig into Trailer 2. Expect plenty more in the year we have to wait until GTA 6 comes out.</p><div id="every-rockstar-game-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3><h3>Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
