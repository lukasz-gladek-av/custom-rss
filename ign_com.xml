I can tell you we’re in the thick of it. We’re making it, we’re playing it. We’re firing on all cylinders," Druckmann told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Variety in a new interview</u></a>. "I’ve said this before, but I really mean it, I’m really feeling it right now: It’s the most ambitious game we’ve ever made. It’s the most expansive game we’ve ever made, maybe the most expensive, by the time we finish it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And with both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-last-of-us-the-series"><u>The Last of Us</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/uncharted"><u>Uncharted</u></a> getting live-action adaptations, Druckmann — who recently<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-chief-neil-druckmann-to-step-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-ahead-of-season-3-to-focus-on-game-development"><u> announced he will not be creatively involved in the upcoming Season 3 of HBO's The Last of Us</u></a> — was keen to stress that while he didn't want to "put the cart in front of the horse" and is keen to ensure Intergalactic is "a fantastic video game first," another Naughty Dog game could become a movie or a series if he has "the right partnership."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm sure if Intergalactic is successful, you will see it again," he added. "Whether that will be our next game right after that, I can't say, and I leave that door open."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The cost of AAA video game development, including first-party Sony games, remains one of the hottest topics within the industry. Microsoft's answer is to go multiplatform with its Xbox games, releasing them on rival consoles as well as PC. Sony is late to the party on this front, refusing, for the most part, to release its PlayStation games on PC at the same time. However, it has shown wriggle room on that front recently, with its live service games like Helldivers 2 coming out on PC at the same time as PS5. Helldivers 2 even ended up on Xbox in what was a first for Sony.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As former president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America Shawn Layden has previously said, when a video game's costs exceed $200 million — as it sounds like Intergalactic will — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-playstation-boss-shawn-layden-says-exclusivity-is-your-achilles-heel-if-game-costs-exceed-200-million"><u>"exclusivity is your Achilles’ heel."</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It reduces your addressable market,” Layden said at the time, citing the success of Arrowhead’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a>. “Particularly when you’re in the world of live service gaming or free-to-play. Another platform is just another way of opening the funnel, getting more people in. In a free-to-play world, as we know, 95% of those people will never spend a nickel. The business is all about conversion. You have to improve your odds by cracking the funnel open."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/12/gettyimages-2219410002-1757674687124.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet will be Naughty Dog's biggest and "maybe" most expensive game ever, Neil Druckmann has said.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With just hours to go until today's major Nintendo Direct broadcast, fans have spotted domain name registrations that point to the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/untitled-the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel">Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel</a> — and potentially reveal its title. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Multiple registrations by NBC Universal have been made that reference <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>, such as supermariogalaxy.movie, the French supermariogalaxy-lefilm.com and the Spanish supermariogalaxy-lapelicula.com. All three were registered on September 10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The beloved Wii platformer originally launched on Wii and featured a storyline that introduced space princess Rosalina, and sparked questions over Princess Peach's original heritage — something that is very briefly also nodded to in the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-bros-movie">Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, will the currently-untitled Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel also be named Super Mario Galaxy? While these domain names have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nef1vl/super_mairo_bros_second_movie_title_leaks_two/?share_id=GTwkEFFSFUtvuEA__yUHn" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">convinced</a> many fans, there's still some uncertainty.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last night, evidence of internal website addresses featuring the title "Super Mario Bros. 2" were also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nehhp6/the_mario_movie_sequel_is_apparently_just_called/?share_id=vMyL7tT1Om1BjjVxYbopV" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted</a> on Universal Pictures' website. And then there's the fact that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unannounced-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-title-super-mario-world-published-then-pulled-from-nbcuniversal-press-release">Universal itself briefly referenced the film as "Super Mario World"</a> in a hastily-scrubbed press release back in May.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the timing of these domain names being registered has raised eyebrows, with fans now feeling confident there will be some kind of announcement made during today's Nintendo Direct. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Super Mario Bros. game is about to celebrate its 40th anniversary, and there is an expectation that Nintendo will mark the occaison with a flurry of announcements — as it did for the game's 35th birthday five years ago.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>so the Old Spice x Super Mario Galaxy Movie deodorants look to be legit. Procter &amp; Gamble applied for trademarks on DESERT DETOUR and BROOKLYN BOUNCE back in July at the Canadian Intellectual Property Office</p><p>other crossover flavors<br>SPACE MISCHIEF<br>CASTLE CRUSH<br>COSMIC QUEST <a href="https://t.co/qjYMjxcOXB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/qjYMjxcOXB</a></p></div>— Nintendeal (@Nintendeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendeal/status/1966261624622416067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Oddly, if the movie is indeed titled Super Mario Galaxy, this won't be the first time we've seen the title appear on the internet. Earlier this year, an image featuring "The Super Mario Galaxy Movie"-emblazoned cans of Old Spice deoderant appeared on the internet, sparking discussion over its authenticity. Several Mario-themed trademarks linked to the image were also purportedly found via the Canadian Intellectual Property Office, fans said, including "Space Mischief," "Cosmic Quest," and "Brooklyn Bounce,"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, fans remarked on the fact that the cans appeared to include previously-unseen artwork of Luigi and Yoshi, though the leak could not be fully verified. Time will tell if it ends up matching with whatever Universal has decided will be the movie's final name.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo and Universal's Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel, whatever it's called, will launch in theaters on April 3, 2026. Today's Nintendo Direct, meanwhile, will air at 6am Pacific / 9am Eastern / 2pm UK time later today — and IGN will be reporting live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We're still processing the news.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> has launched on Steam to big concurrent player numbers, but the release was marred by complaints about PC performance that have resulted in a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 peaked at 207,479 concurrent player numbers on Steam yesterday, September 11, which was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-the-biggest-borderlands-ever-on-steam-just-an-hour-after-launch">significantly higher than any previous Borderlands before it</a>. However, the game launched to ‘mostly negative’ Steam reviews over performance issues and crashing, before recovering overnight to ‘mixed.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The complaints revolve around poor performance even on high powered PCs, with some affected by crashing that makes the game difficult to even start.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Terrible optimization. Another Unreal Engine 5 casualty. Not worth buying in its current state unless you have a NASA PC,” said one person in a negative review.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Terrible, terrible performance. Worst I've ever seen. Turned it down to Low graphics presets and couldn't hit 60 FPS, even with FSR upscaling on my RX 6900 XT,” said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Gearbox posted a Borderlands 4 Nvidia Optimization guide on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/679602429802577921" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>, advising players how to optimize their graphics settings for “better performance and framerates” on PC with the Nvidia app.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As PC gamers begin their Vault-hunting journeys in Borderlands 4, we've seen early feedback from the community surrounding graphics settings and how to achieve optimal performance,” Gearbox said, before outlining the “expected results” for the Borderlands 4 PC specs:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Minimum PC specs - 1080p @ 30FPS with Low Preset settings</li><li>Recommended PC specs - 1440p @ 60FPS with Medium Preset settings</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox then issued a piece of advice to PC gamers that to me reads like an effort to prevent players from making knee-jerk reactions to the game's performance as soon as they’ve changed their settings: “Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile. Please keep playing for at least 15 minutes to see how your PC's performance has changed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox went on to show the “Optimal Settings” charts provided by Nvidia with suggestions for which graphics settings may work best for your combination of GPU and desired display resolution. Meanwhile, it recommended using the Nvidia app to download and install Nvidia’s newest Game Ready Driver (581.29) and “optimize for your system.” If all else fails, “please contact 2K Support for direct assistance.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox and publisher 2K Games will be keen to address the performance complaints early, given the impact negative reviews on Steam can have on a video game’s success. Ahead of launch, Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford had said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-day-1-patch-does-a-lot-randy-pitchford-says-but-dont-expect-miracles-from-older-pc-hardware">the Borderlands 4 Day 1 patch “does a lot,”</a> amid concern about the performance of the looter shooter. Pitchford had responded to concern about Borderlands 4’s pre-release performance on PC from some users on X / Twitter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the Day 1 patch, playing Borderlands 4 on older hardware won't miraculously unlock "buttery smooth performance," Pitchford added. It should be expected that Borderlands 4 is “unplayable” if you’re trying to use a PC below min-spec, he said, and, generally, playing new AAA games on older hardware won't achieve impressive results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Pitchford's comment in full:</p><blockquote>The Day 1 patch does a lot! That said, the expectation for using a below min-spec machine should be that the game is unplayable. That the game runs at all on your system is a miracle. That you can get 55 - 60 fps out of heavy combat is actually incredible given how the engine and what's going on under the hood. Your specification doesn't indicate if you're on SDD or HDD, but that could also explain some of the hitching. It's a big, bold, new, seamless world and I'm sorry to say that older hardware may not provide buttery smooth performance for the latest gen AAA games, as has always been the case since the dawn of PC gaming.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">As a reminder, here are Borderlands 4’s PC specs:</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Borderlands 4 System Requirements:</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Minimum:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li><li>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</li><li>Memory: 16 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT / Intel Arc A580</li><li>Storage: 100 GB available space</li><li>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system.
