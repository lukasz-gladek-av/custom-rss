            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Best Buy still has it in stock.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead of launching with a new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-3d-platformer-ranked">3D Mario game</a> like many expected, Nintendo opted to create the first 3D Donkey Kong game since Donkey Kong 64, marking the first brand-new DK game since 2014. Donkey Kong Bananza stars the fan-favorite Kong naturally, but it also features a young Pauline, who first reappeared in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review">Super Mario Odyssey</a> back in 2017. Together, the two aim to smash their way to the center of the planet, where wishes are supposedly granted. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Donkey Kong Bananza Is Out Now!</h2><div catalogid="c98403e2-b486-4735-a4e3-b129ab1054cb" id="225410"><p data-cy="paragraph">As you hunt for the hundreds of Banandium Gems scattered throughout each layer of the world, you'll need to open up the terrain using Donkey Kong's abilities. Donkey Kong Bananza completely reinvents the Donkey Kong formula, allowing the titular Kong to smash, break, and crash his way through any terrain. You can choose to smash through an entire wall, take a piece of the wall and throw it, or even surf on a slab of rock.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Bananza would not have been possible without the power of Nintendo Switch 2. The game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-mario-kart-world-donkey-kong-bananza-was-originally-a-switch-1-game-nintendo-confirms">initially began development on the Nintendo Switch</a>, but the team quickly realized that the limited hardware would prevent the game from reaching its potential. This is the best showcase of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/Nintendo_Switch_2_vs_Nintendo_Switch_Comparison_Chart">Switch 2's hardware</a> yet, especially with the Voxel technology used throughout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza is available now for Nintendo Switch 2, with the full game available on the cartridge. If you've yet to pick up the game, now is the perfect time to do so at <a href="https://zdcs.link/z62pyl?object_uuid=432e0149-f0b2-4091-b02d-3bb18f8825c0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Best Buy.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.
