"Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days. Sorry folks."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Days later, Epic Games issued a carefully-worded follow-up where it said it had subsequently "worked closely with our partners at Warner Bros. Games to confirm there were no creative intentions to connect the Peaceful Hips Emote and the current Peacemaker storyline." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end result? "To avoid any confusion," the developer continued, "we're modifying the Emote choreography in next week's update." To some, the statement seemed unclear as to whether the emote was a reference to the show's own Nazi references. If so, why was it returning? If not, why was it being changed? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, today's big Fortnite patch (which also adds the game's Halloween event Fortnitemares, as well as a first nod to its highly-anticipated The Simpsons mini-season) has now made the switch, with the Peaceful Hips emote now updated. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">See the original dance emote and the updated one both below for comparison:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>DC Peacemaker 'Peaceful Hips' Emote will be disabled </p><p>"As we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote.
