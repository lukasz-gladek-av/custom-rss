            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/yes-mario-kart-worlds-cow-can-eat-burgers-and-steak<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We're grilling Nintendo about this.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I feel like we've earned a reprieve today from the news chaos of tariffs and Nintendo Switch 2 pricing, so here's something fun (?) for your Friday: IGN played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> at a Nintendo event in New York this week, and confirmed that yes, the new Cow character can in fact eat burgers and steak (and many others things as well).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're wondering what on earth we could possibly be talking about, allow me to point you to the recent announcement of Mario Kart World, which included the introduction of the Moo Moo Meadows Cow as a playable racer. The Internet, of course, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-can-play-as-the-moo-moo-meadows-cow-in-mario-kart-world-and-the-internet-is-thrilled">is thrilled about this</a>, already coming up with dozens of memes and fanart of the adorable Cow that, until recently, was nothing more prominent than a fun background character in a single Mario Kart track.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, as news of Cow spread throughout the land, fans began pointing out a potential, erm, problem, with another element of the Mario Kart World reveal. In the Nintendo Direct 2 trailer from Wednesday, Mario eats a burger. Burgers are (typically) made of beef. Would Cow, whose people are ostensibly a source of beef, consume beef herself? Fans really wanted to know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well at the Nintendo preview event, we found out. You see, the food items we saw in the trailer are obtainable in Mario Kart World at Yoshi's diner locations scattered across courses. They function like a drive-thru, allowing racers to drive up and grab a bag of take-out just like they would an item box. There are a lot of different food items that can be inside, including burgers, steak kebabs, pizza, and donuts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yes, Cow can eat them all.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, Cow CAN eat steak in Mario Kart World. <a href="https://t.co/qN5PZ9IIM4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/qN5PZ9IIM4</a></p>— IGN (@IGN) <a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1908259261769003473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">During our session we also saw Cow eat a number of other items, including the burger. We're still a little hazy on what these items are actually doing for Cow — other racers change costumes when consuming them, but Cow doesn't seem to experience any effects. Could she be eating beef just because she enjoys it? Is there a secret power-up she gets from burger consumption that we just don't know about yet because Nintendo hasn't revealed it? Or perhaps are these veggie burgers and Beyond meat kebabs?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN reached out to Nintendo to try and clear all this up, but we haven't heard back yet. I'm sure it's because they're busy at their New York event, and not because this is an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5RRyyHsjoU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unhinged question to ask</a> their PR about. Yeah, that's probably it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway go check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">preview of Mario Kart World</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">video version of which</a> features an appearance by our friend Cow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
