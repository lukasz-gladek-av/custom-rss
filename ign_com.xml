            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to buying a puzzle, there are a few things to think about: How <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/largest-jigsaw-puzzles">big do you want said puzzle to be</a>? Do you want to tackle a 2D puzzle, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-3d-puzzle-alternatives-to-expensive-lego-sets">attempt a 3D model</a>? And, most importantly, what kind of design are you looking to piece together? There's an overwhelming amount of options to choose from in regard, from beautiful works of art to shots plucked from the world of TV and movies, that it can feel tricky to find the best pick for your interests. But if you're a cinephile looking for puzzles that capture movie posters from some of your favorite films, we're here to help.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it's a collage of multiple movie posters brought together as a single big puzzle or something focused around a classic one sheet, we've gathered up some of the coolest movie poster puzzles we believe are worth your time and money.

Starting off strong, this Lord of the Rings triptych puzzle from Aquarius comes to 1,000 pieces and features posters for all of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-movies-in-order">Lord of the Rings movies</a>.

What really makes this puzzle stand out, though, is the awesome case that it comes in. To add to the '80s nostalgia, everything comes packaged in a VHS-style case, which is sure to look incredibly cool when placed on your shelf.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Spin Master Games Jaws Puzzle (500 Pieces)</h2></div><div catalogid="8ab5eeae-e9ed-49f9-b7d4-2ac2a5be2279" id="225794"><div id="225794" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Jaws Movie 500-Piece Puzzle in Plastic Retro Blockbuster VHS Video Case</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This year marks 50 years since the release of Steven Spielberg's unforgettable blockbuster, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/jaws">Jaws</a>. And if you're looking to celebrate the occasion, why not do it with this Jaws movie poster puzzle from Spin Master Games? It features the iconic image of "Bruce" the shark sneaking up on a swimmer with the film's title across the top. Similar to the Ghostbusters puzzle, it's 500 pieces and even comes packaged in a VHS-style case, only this time straight from the shelves of Blockbuster. A truly excellent package for movie fans.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Aquarius Harry Potter Movie Posters Collage Puzzle (1,000 Pieces)</h2></div><div catalogid="8ab5eeae-e9ed-49f9-b7d4-2ac2a5be2279" id="225795"><div id="225795" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>AQUARIUS Harry Potter Puzzle Movie Posters Collage (1000 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like with the Lord of the Rings triptych, it's sometimes too hard to pick just one poster from a series of films. So why settle for just one when you can have everything all together? This Harry Potter puzzle from Aquarius, which comes to 1,000 pieces, is perfect for fans who want to make sure every movie poster from the franchise is accounted for. It features <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-movies-in-order">all eight Harry Potter movies</a> as posters across the top and bottom, with Ron, Harry, and Hermione in the middle. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Aquarius The Goonies Puzzle (500 Pieces)</h2></div><div catalogid="8ab5eeae-e9ed-49f9-b7d4-2ac2a5be2279" id="225796"><div id="225796" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>AQUARIUS The Goonies 500pc Puzzle (500 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is another movie poster puzzle from Aquarius, but this time only covering one movie poster rather than multiple from a franchise. For fans of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-goonies">'80s classic The Goonies</a>, this puzzle comes to 500 pieces and captures the film's one sheet in a truly frame-worthy final product. By the time you're finished, you'll be itching to watch it and experience the adventure all over again.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ceaco Disney/Pixar Movie Posters Puzzle (2,000 Pieces)</h2></div><div catalogid="8ab5eeae-e9ed-49f9-b7d4-2ac2a5be2279" id="225797"><div id="225797" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ceaco - Disney / Pixar - Movie Posters - 2000 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, there are simply too many good Pixar movie posters to focus on just one. Thankfully, this 2,000 piece puzzle from Ceaco features a big collage of several different posters from the company, from Finding Nemo to The Incredibles to Toy Story to Coco. If you're a Pixar fan, this massive puzzle is an excellent project to take on. By the time you finally finish this puzzle, you'll likely want to watch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pixar-movies-in-order">all of the Pixar movies in order</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should You Buy a Puzzle or a Poster for Your Wall?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This depends on what you're looking for. Paper movie posters can really capture that traditional feeling of walking into a movie theater when they're in a frame, but puzzle movie posters like the ones above add a fun pop of personality to a room. Since they come in different sizes and styles - especially if you choose to go with one of the collage-style puzzles listed above - and you pieced them together yourself, they can add a nice personal touch to your wall. But again, it all depends on your personal preference of what sort of poster design you'd rather have up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're leaning towards framing the movie poster puzzles listed above, we can help with that, too. You can check out some of our favorite frames for puzzles in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-gifts">puzzle gift guide</a> and this <a href="https://zdcs.link/av48p8?object_uuid=f9d1f4ba-9fce-40f0-95e6-df22dc343bc6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RoseArt Jigsaw Puzzle Glue</a> will help you keep your favorite pieces together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 1, 2025 11:52 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-movie-poster-puzzles]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Studio head Kelley Gilmore was recently replaced, per report.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">BioShock 4 is currently undergoing a bit of a development overhaul after it recently failed a review by 2K Games executives, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new report from Bloomberg</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per the report, the new BioShock game, which has been in development for the last decade, was criticized by executives especially for issues with its narrative. The studio will allegedly work to overhaul the story in the coming months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioShock 4's struggles have also apparently resulted in the removal of Cloud Chamber Games studio head Kelley Gilmore, and the shifting of creative director Hogarth de la Plante into a publishing role. Employees were told in a recent all-hands that the company needs to become, per Bloomberg, "more agile and efficient," which has some workers afraid layoffs may be on the horizon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2K Games confirmed Gilmore and de la Plante's role changes to Bloomberg, and shared the following statement:</p><blockquote>We are working hard to set BioShock up for the best possible future. Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloomberg's report also revealed that a BioShock 1 remake was in development at 2K, but was canceled earlier this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We first heard reports that BioShock 4 was in development <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/13/2k-studio-reportedly-developing-new-bioshock">way back in 2018</a>, when it was still apparently pretty early in the process. The following year it was officially <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/09/new-bioshock-game-confirmed-being-developed-by-new-developer-cloud-chamber">confirmed to be in development at new studio Cloud Chamber</a>, but IGN was told at the time that the team was at "the earlier end of our process." It was also confirmed that original BioShock creative director Ken Levine was not working on the game, but was instead focusing on his own project, Judas, at Ghost Story Games (it's due. However, a number of other BioShock veterans were said to be working on it, including de la Plante, art director Scott Sinclair, and design director Jonathan Pelling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the years since, we've gleaned very little in the way of details on BioShock 4. From job listings, we've put together that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-setting-rapture-columbia-job-listings">won't take place in any of the settings from previous games</a>, and that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-bioshock-game-hiring-writer-for-open-world-setting">may be open-world</a>. In 2022, it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-writer-joins-bioshock-4-as-narrative-lead">picked up former Ghost of Tsushima writer</a> Liz Albl as a narrative lead. And last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/leaked-bioshock-4-image-tells-us-next-to-nothing-about-the-game">an image that may have come from the in-progress new BioShock leaked online</a>, though it was allegedly from an early 2021 demo of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that we have yet to see gameplay or hear even a whisper of a release window, it may still be a while yet before BioShock 4 fully emerges. In the meantime, while Levine's Judas was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-story-games-judas-is-currently-planned-for-release-by-march-2025">at one point expected to be out by March 2025</a>, that deadline has come and gone. But we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/judas-gameplay-overview-of-bioshock-creators-next-game">got a preview of the game last March</a>, so it may have to serve to tide over fans until BioShock 4 is ready to emerge once more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
