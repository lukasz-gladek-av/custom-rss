            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Praise the Omnissiah.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> is set for a second year of DLC, and we have the first details on its huge 10.0 update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Breakout hit Space Marine 2 has sold 7 million copies, so it’s no surprise to see Year 2 support confirmed by publisher Focus Entertainment and developer Saber Interactive. In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500577186633221225" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community update</a>, the companies said Year 2 will bring new PvE missions, enemies, weapons, and more unannounced content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 came out in September 2024, and as part of its first anniversary, a “large-scale” update is planned to release in September. Patch 10.0 sounds like a big one for Space Marine 2, but it’s worth noting that Patch 9.0 is due out beforehand. 9.0 was meant to add a new PvP mode, but that’s now delayed to 10.0, which means 9.0 will add only balance changes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We do know a little about this new PvP mode, however. The twist here is it’s Chaos vs Chaos set on a new map, and, most interesting of all, you’ll be able to take control of the Helbrute. The Helbrute, for the uninitiated, is a variant of the Chaos Dreadnought, an evil death-dealer piloted by a Chaos Space Marine trapped within its plated metal chest. You might remember the Helbrute from the Space Marine 2 campaign, where it came off worse in a scrap with the Ultramarines’ Brother Valtus. Alongside this new Chaos-themed PvP mode are new Chaos armours, which are much-requested by fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, 10.0 adds the new Power Axe melee weapon, which has its own moveset and execution animations. We have a first look below:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/01/b9d4da70b5f382d137a5fc2c8a7c87556b8e5053-1751353725644.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Space Marine 2's upcoming Power Axe. Image credit: Focus Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ahead-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-patch-8-fans-believe-datamines-have-revealed-everything-from-the-new-class-to-a-new-much-wanted-melee-weapon-and-a-surprising-new-gun">Datamines had suggested the Power Axe</a>, which makes sense in the context of Games Workshop’s ongoing Space Wolves push for the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game. And let’s remember, in December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-modders-put-the-axe-from-secret-levels-warhammer-40000-episode-into-the-game"><u>IGN reported on Space Marine 2 modders who put the axe from Secret Level’s Warhammer 40,000 episode into the game</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>THIS is why I’m a fan of Warhammer 40k! Hats off to <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimeVideo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@PrimeVideo</a> for producing Secret Level: And They Shall Know No Fear.

We don’t have a first look yet, but it’s advanced enough in development to be announced. Expect more on the Techmarine in the next community updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Techmarine perhaps doesn’t come as a huge surprise given it was also strongly hinted at in datamines (the files mentioned a perk called ‘shoulder gun bolter,’ which is a clear indication that Techmarines are finally in play). For the uninitiated, a Techmarine is a Space Marine engineer-type class who's a big fan of the Cult Mechanicus as well as their Chapter. They’re big on technology and specialize in fixing and maintaining vehicles and other big stuff, such as Dreadnoughts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a lot of new Space Marine 2 content coming down the line, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive"><u>despite the surprise announcement that development of Space Marine 3 development had begun</u></a>.

On one side, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a> cards are going through a steep correction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Crown Zenith</a> cards are showing early signs of what could be a long-term value surge. The bottom line? If you're a collector or investor, <strong>now is the time to buy into both.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m picking up what I can from both sets. The current dip in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-booster-bundle-shining-fates-amazon-restock-latest">Sparks</a> is a glimmer of hope for long-suffering 2024-2025 collectors. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-card-packs">Crown Zenith</a> is a train I want to be on before it leaves the station. Let's go into more detail:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/pixel-9-15-1751288444113.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Game Freak / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with Surging Sparks. A handful of top cards have taken noticeable hits in the last few weeks. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJB7d?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Pikachu ex - 247/191</strong></a>, for example, has dropped a whopping 51% since early April, falling from $113.38 to just $56. That’s a steep decline, no doubt, but it's important to put it in context. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re seeing more sealed product become available every week, and as supply rises, prices are naturally correcting. <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l37AE?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Hydreigon ex - 240/191</strong></a><strong> </strong>has also taken a 34% hit, now sitting at $49.60, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1ODK?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Milotic ex - 237/191</strong></a> is down 26% to $99. Even the alternate-art <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoGOLg?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Pikachu ex - 238/191</strong></a> is feeling the pressure, dropping 22% to $294.99, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWY75n?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Latias ex - 239/191</strong></a> has slipped 23% to $193.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this isn’t panic selling or lost interest in Surging Sparks, it’s the result of increased availability. Collectors and resellers aren’t willing to overpay for cards that are easier to find. If anything, that creates opportunity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These aren’t bad cards; they’re just correcting from an inflated early market. For anyone who missed the initial wave or hesitated at launch prices, <strong>this correction is your window</strong>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/pixel-9-17-1751289091092.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Game Freak / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Crown Zenith</em> is telling a very different story. Cards from this set, particularly the stunning Secret Rare VSTARs, are starting to heat up. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJn7r?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Giratina VSTAR (Secret) GG69/GG70</strong></a> has jumped 24% this month, climbing from $152.78 to $199.99. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwnAG?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Origin Forme Dialga VSTAR (Secret)</strong></a> shot up 22% in just a few days, now holding at $84.99.

Even secondary stars like <a href="https://zdcs.link/av4oL2?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Mewtwo VSTAR - GG44/GG70</strong></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXG4L?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Arceus VSTAR - GG70/GG70</strong></a> are each up 11% from their recent lows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're at a pivotal moment in the Pokémon TCG timeline. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review">Scarlet and Violet</a> era is drawing to a close, and with the Mega Evolution era moving in after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed">Black Bolt and White Flare</a> sets later this year, we’re about to enter the next generation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That transition turns <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/13/pokemon-sword-and-shield-review">Sword and Shield</a>-era sets like Crown Zenith into the odd category of not-so modern Pokémon cards. If historic price climbs tells us anything, <strong>cards become more valuable two generations out</strong>. We’ve seen this pattern with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-x-y">XY</a> and early <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/15/pokemon-sun-and-moon-review">Sun &amp; Moon</a> sets, and I expect Sword and Shield to follow suit alongside old <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-brave-mega-symphonia-sets-announced-for-2025">Mega Evolution</a> Pokémon.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Sealed Product Price Comparison</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the pricing here by Amazon is insane, but there's some deals to be had when comparing these products to TCG Player. For example, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7YM4?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prismatic Evolutions Super-Premium Collection</a> is a massive 56% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xEG5?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">market value</a>, so go with Amazon on that one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other end of the scale, TCG Player has <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnm1k?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cynthia’s Garchomp ex Premium Collection</a> at a massive 48% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpXZv?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon's current price</a>, which is very close to MSRP. I've compared all the prices in the carousel above, but another pro tip is clicking through to eBay to see if there's any new bargains to be had.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Last Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the Scarlet &amp; Violet era winds down with the upcoming <em>Black Bolt</em> and <em>White Flare</em> sets, collectors are already looking backward in anticipation of what’s next—namely, the long-awaited return of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deals-for-today-mega-evolutions-fast-charging-and-a-few-smart-picks">Mega Evolutions</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Think Peekaboo with bullets.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pubg-blindspot"><u>PUBG: Blindspot</u></a> is a cheeky little <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pubg-battlegrounds"><u>PUBG: Battlegrounds</u></a> spin off that's currently in development, and was playable on the show floor at IGN Live. It's a 5v5 top-down tactical shooter that has a classic team deathmatch mode - one we got hooked on even in the chaos of the gaming show floor - and a Demolition mode, that will see teams using traps and obstacles to outwit the enemy. It's been compared to a top-down Rainbow Six Siege and with good reason: to rack up the kills you're going to need to use your brain as well as your trigger finger. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>1. Think 'Peekaboo with bullets'</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Forget all your FPS muscle memory, this is a top-down strategic PvP game where your cunning is as important as your reaction times. You're dropped into a map full of corners, windows, doorways - basically anything you can think of to make line of sight a key part of gameplay - and you have to hunt down your opponents before they pop one in your back. You can see the whole map, but you'll only see enemies if they're in your cone of vision or your teammates, which sounds simple until someone snipes you through a window while you're focused on the doorway at the end of a corridor. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>2. Demolition Mode is on the way </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While we didn't get to play the Demolition Mode, it sounds like a step up in complexity from the 5v5 deathmatch, adding a greater need for planning and teamwork. Production Director Seungmyeong Yang explained more about it at IGN Live. "Demolition Mode can commonly be found in other games such as Counter Strike or Valorant," he said. "In this Demolition Mode there is an attacking team and a defending team, and the defense team basically tries to block the attacking team from coming in and the attacking team tries to breach the building. It was really fun to see how the gamers react, they seem to really enjoy the game!" Demolition Mode is the inspiration for those Rainbow Six Siege comparisons, albeit it from a whole new top-down perspective. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">PUBG: Blindspot at IGN Live</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>3. Start your WASD warmups </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The keyboard and mouse controls are more like a twin-stick shooter set up, and it's going to take your brain a second to catch up to how they work. You control movement with WASD and your cone of vision with the mouse, while to aim and fire weapons you hold down the right mouse button. That will slow your movement, though, so it's always a balance between moving quickly to avoid enemy detection and choosing when to take your shots. Once you've mastered that you can focus on being more accurate, using the mouse wheel and keyboard to go for head shots, body shots, or aiming specifically at any crouched enemies. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>4. Character choice is key</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like any team game, who you have in your five-person kill crew is going to matter. The build I played had 10 characters to choose from, each with pleasingly distinct looks and loadouts to keep things interesting. I'm not exactly a subtle operative, so I gravitated towards those with weapons that could cause carnage up close and personal, like bearded cowboy Collision, who packs a Winchester 1300 shotgun and booby traps; or Kayak, who has a semi-automatic O12 combat shotgun and a remote sticky bomb. Support players can go for Fanatic with her P90 and First Aid Kid, or sniper Buddy with her scanning drones. Some you might want to play just because of their character designs - I'm not usually one for Toxic Gas Grenades, but Dropdown has a sort of Dystopian Harley Quinn vibe that's hard to resist. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>5. You can play it in August</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no official release date for the full game, but there is a PC beta planned for August. Keep an eye on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/PUBG_BLINDSPOT/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official Steam page</u></a> for updates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial. She's been a professional nerd since 2006 when she got her start on Official PlayStation Magazine in the UK, and has since worked for GamesIndustry.Biz, Rolling Stone and GamesRadar. She loves horror, horror movies, horror games, and French Bulldogs. Those extra wrinkles on her face are thanks to going time blind and staying up too late finishing every sidequest in RPGs like Fallout and Witcher 3.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-pubg-blindspot]]></content:encoded>
