            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With the arrival of the Mega Dimensions DLC for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, <a href="https://planetpokemon.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Planet Pokémon</u></a>, powered by a team-up of Pokémon experts from Maxroll, Eurogamer, and IGN, has delved into Hyperspace to uncover all of the knowledge you need to be fully prepared for this new adventure in Lumiose City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our <a href="https://planetpokemon.com/legends-z-a/planner" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Pokémon Planner</u></a> now includes all of the Mega Evolutions and returning Pokémon added to Legends: Z-A in the new DLC. This includes Pokémon base stats and movesets. With this information on hand, you can start experimenting with your team before catching the Pokémon in-game. Don't worry if you haven't used the planner before, our handy <a href="https://planetpokemon.com/news/how-to-use-the-planet-pokemon-planner" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Pokémon Planner guide</u></a> will teach you all the tricks.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/11/screenshot-2025-12-11-at-9-18-31-am-1765473664409.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside this, our <a href="https://planetpokemon.com/legends-z-a/pokedex" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Legends: Z-A Pokédex</u></a> and <a href="https://planetpokemon.com/legends-z-a/items" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Items list</u></a> have also been updated for the DLC. So whether you're checking to see if your favourite Pokémon has returned or if a handy item has been added, you'll find it all here on Planet Pokémon. Here's a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-legends-z-a/Mega_Dimension_DLC">full list of what's been updated in the Mega Dimensions DLC</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-legends-z-a/How_to_Start_the_Mega_Dimension_DLC">Remember, you need to have completed the main campaign in Legends: Z-A to play the Mega Dimensions DLC. </a>When you do, you'll experience a simple task - helping a young girl bake a donut - transform into combating another threat looming over Lumiose City. (I'm starting to wonder why people live there… It's a bit of a danger magnet.) You won't just be fighting Rogue Mega Evolutions this time though. No, you'll be crossing the boundaries of time and space itself thanks to a Hoopa who can open Hyperspace portals after eating a donut. Not the weirdest thing to happen in a Pokémon game, but it's up there.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/11/screenshot-2025-12-11-at-9-17-31-am-1765473664409.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Along the way, you'll team up with old friends, collect new Mega Evolutions like Mega Lucario Z and catch returning Pokémon from past generations, such as Meowth, Mudkip and Mimikyu. There's also a host of new Side Missions for you to complete too! One might even lead you to a Legendary Pokémon… Just be prepared for the Pokémon in Hyperspace to have levels higher than what you're used to. I'm talking over 100! Thankfully, the right donut can make your team just as dangerous.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/11/screenshot-2025-12-11-at-9-18-38-am-1765473664410.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Hope you enjoy the Mega Dimensions DLC and don't forget to check out the updated Pokémon Planner over on Planet Pokémon!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lottie Lynn is the Guides Editor over at Eurogamer. She covers a wide of games - spanning the latest RPG to farming simulators to an awful lot of Pokémon. Thankfully she's a massive Pokémon fan and lore expert, having started playing back in the Pokémon Yellow days. Though her Pokémon collection actually started before the series even reached UK shores due to her Dad bringing back a Pikachu child alarm from a business trip to Japan. (A purchase he most likely regrets for multiple reasons.)</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/plan-your-pokemon-team-mega-dimensions-dlc-added-to-planet-pokemon-tool]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has claimed the employees it recently fired were dismissed because they leaked game features for upcoming and unannounced titles in Discord, not because they were trying to unionize.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement provided to IGN, a Rockstar Games spokesperson said:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rockstar Games took action against a small group of individuals, across the UK and internationally, who distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations. Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">34 members of staff at Rockstar were dismissed, 31 in the UK and three in Canada, sparking protests outside the office of GTA 6 developer Rockstar North in Edinburgh, Scotland, and outside parent company Take-Two’s office in London.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Rockstar North and Take-Two Office Protest Photos Nov 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar’s statement comes after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-prime-minister-sir-keir-starmer-says-rockstar-firing-31-gta-6-developers-over-alleged-union-busting-is-deeply-concerning-and-pledges-that-ministers-will-now-investigate">UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the case “deeply concerning,"</a> and pledged that ministers would investigate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The layoffs, which took place at the end of October, were raised in the UK's Parliament during this week’s session of Prime Minister's Questions by Rockstar North's local MP Chris Murray.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The video games company Rockstar in my constituency last month fired 31 employees without providing evidence or union representation," Murray told the Prime Minister. "The [Independent Workers Union of Great Britain union] IWGB alleges union busting. Having met Rockstar they failed to reassure me they are following employment law and I share concerns about union busting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Given this government is responsible for the biggest increase in workers rights in a generation," Murray continued, "does the Prime Minister agree all companies regardless of profit size must follow UK employment law and all workers have the right to join a union?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a deeply concerning case," Starmer replied. "Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Our ministers will look into the particular case that he [Murray] raises and will keep him updated."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted the IWGB for further comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement sent to IGN this week, MP Chris Murray shared further, eyebrow-raising detail of his attempts to discuss the matter with Rockstar itself, including a joint meeting alongside fellow Edinburgh MPs Tracy Gilbert and Scott Arthur at Rockstar North's offices which began with a standoff over the need to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The meeting began with us as MPs refused entry unless an NDA was signed, a request they eventually withdrew after it being made clear this would not be signed," Murray said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: "The meeting only entrenched my concerns about the process Rockstar used to dismiss so many of their staff members. I was not assured their process paid robust attention to UK employment law, I was not convinced that this course of action was necessary, and alarmingly, I did not leave informed on exactly what these 31 people had done to warrant their immediate dismissal."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Rockstar's now-former staff, the IWGB has formally taken up their case and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-video-game-worker-union-files-legal-claims-against-gta-6-developer-rockstar-alleging-trade-union-victimisation-and-blacklisting">filed legal claims against Rockstar Games</a>, alleging that their dismissal constituted "trade union victimisation and blacklisting." The first step on this legal journey will see the IWGB's claim examined by a tribunal who will determine whether the ex-employees are eligible for any interim relief. IGN recently questioned Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick on the matter, who answered by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-our-culture-is-extraordinary-amid-accusations-of-union-busting-at-gta-6-dev-rockstar-games">defending the company's culture</a> and saying that Take-Two was "incredibly proud of our labor relations."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
