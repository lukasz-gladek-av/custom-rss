It suggests Konami's keen to engage with fans of the franchise to help the publisher prioritize which games we'd love to see remade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The choices, <a href="https://x.com/MGSMGN/status/1969354623007014979/photo/2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>as shared on X/Twitter by MGSMGN</u></a>, include:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Metal Gear</li><li>Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake</li><li>Metal Gear Solid</li><li>Metal Gear Solid 2 Sons of Liberty</li><li>Metal Gear Solid 4 Guns of the Patriot</li><li>Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker</li><li>Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes</li><li>Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">What's interesting here is that the list includes games from the series before the seminal Metal Gear Solid, and also overlooks both series spin-offs <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-rising-revengeance"><u>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-survive"><u>Metal Gear Survive</u></a>. Which game would you most like to see remade?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Between its old-school stealth-action gameplay and engaging spy-thriller story, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater largely succeeds as a faithful, visually impressive remake of the 2004 classic," we wrote when we reviewed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review"><u>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, awarding it 8/10</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
