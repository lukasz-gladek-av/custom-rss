            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's that time again to hang some Poké Balls on your Trevenant or Exeggutor and get festive, but it's not Christmas without spending some Pokédollars on some good old Pokémon merch, right? I'm a massive Pokémon trainer (both in circumference and fandom), and I know a thing or two about the video games, TCG, plushies, and Funko.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I thought this is the best time of year for a Pokémon Gift Guide, with the back end of 2025 focusing on the return of Mega Evolution. First introduced in the Pokémon X and Y video games and TCG, it's the most favored Pokémon gimmick, and it's back for the mainline games’ return to Kalos in Pokémon Legends: Z-A. So let's get into it, because there's a gift here for every budget and Pokéfan:</p><p id="tcg-gifts"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TCG Gifts">Best Pokémon TCG Gifts</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon Trading Card Game</a> has seen the end of the Scarlet and Violet era this year, ending with the Black Bolt and White Flare expansions. We're now a base set and expansion into the Mega Evolution era, with the most recent set being the Mega Charizard X-fronted Phantasmal Flames. Speaking of:</p><p id="mega-charizard-x-ex-ultra-premium-co"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Co">Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h3></p><div catalogid="8c2b65e5-eb62-4ba4-9042-a68913f09135" id="210682"><div id="210682" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At market value on Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a pain in the Mudbray trying to get hold of the Mega Charizard X ex Ultra Premium Collection, but it looks like stock is freeing up just in time for the Christmas rush. Plus, Amazon is currently selling it near MSRP and at market value when compared to TCGplayer. It contains the following booster packs alongside Mega Charizard X-themed card sleeves, deck box, damage counter dice, playmat, and a metal coin:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>4 x Phantasmal Flames</li><li>4 x Mega Evolution</li><li>4 x Destined Rivals</li><li>4 x Journey Together</li><li>2 x Surging Sparks</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The main pull of this UPC is the Mega Charizard X ex Mega Attack Rare and Oricorio ex SIR promo cards, which, frankly, are the best couple of promo cards we've had in a big box collection for a while.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Best Pokémon Chase Cards You Can Pull in Packs Right Now</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you follow my Crashers and Climbers weekly column, you'll know by now that Pokémon TCG is starting to find a new floor with individual card values thanks to better stock levels nationwide. That means it's going to save trainers even more money buying single chase cards over ripping hundreds of booster packs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The carousel above contains the top 5 Pokémon TCG chase cards from each expansion from the current Mega Evolution and previous Scarlet and Violet eras. Any of these cards would make a great gift this Christmas; it just depends on your budget!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Pokémon TCG</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Prefer to gift sealed products? No problem, I've gone through the regularly stocked products by big box retailers like Amazon and price-checked them against TCGplayer to make sure you're getting the best bang for your Pokébucks. TCGplayer is an online marketplace where vendors sell single cards and sealed products for multiple different trading card games, including Pokémon TCG. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's owned by eBay, and sellers have their own review ratings on there, so you can check over a seller before you buy. It's also a great price-tracking tool for Pokémon trainers and collectors in the US, so you can see what the value of any particular card or sealed product was up to 12 months ago. It's always worth a check to make sure you're getting the best deal before you buy from pretty much anywhere.</p></div><p id="video-games"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Video Games">Pokémon Video Games</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'd be shocked if you haven't at least tried a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-games-in-order">mainline Pokémon gam</a>e, seeing as they've been around since 1999, but there's a first time for everything. I've focused on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-pokemon-games-on-nintendo-switch">Nintendo Switch 1 and 2 Pokémon games</a> here, and there's currently some great discounts going. I've even managed to work out the cheapest way to get the Switch 2 version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Cheapest Pokémon Legends: Z-A Deal</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously, this is while stocks last, but if you pick up the Nintendo Switch 1 version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A for $44.99 on Woot, then upgrade it to the Switch 2 version for $9.99 via the Amazon digital code service, you're saving $15 over buying the usual Switch 2 copy of Legends: Z-A. If you're going to dive into the Mega Dimension DLC too, you're paying a total of $84.97 vs. the full-fat price of $98.99.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Pokémon Video Games</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Legends: Z-A isn't the only Pokémon game getting a nice discount right now, either. One of the top games for Nintendo Switch is Pokémon Legends: Arceus, a pseudo-prequel to Z-A that showcases similar mechanics and carries on the trend of turning the traditional gameplay of Pokémon games on its head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're rocking a Switch 2 this Christmas, I'd highly recommend getting Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. They're the latest traditional Pokémon games that get a much-needed and free upgrade for Nintendo Switch 2. That means it now runs at a full 60 frames per second in handheld and docked mode, with 4K resolution when playing through the TV. There's more Pokémon hanging around in the wild now, too, and some other quality-of-life improvements that fix most of the issues it had at launch.</p><p id="funko-pop"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Funko Pop!">Pokémon Gifts: Funko Pop!</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, I won't collect Funko Pops, as I'd end up not feeding my kids, and you have to do that every now and again, apparently. But they're awesome nonetheless; I just have zero self-control with collectibles. There's some bargains to be had right now, such as 2 for $24 on select Pokémon Funkos on Amazon, to some cheeky discounts on others.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Funko Pop Moments Deluxe: Pokémon Starters</h3><div catalogid="8c2b65e5-eb62-4ba4-9042-a68913f09135" id="233657"><div id="233657" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Funko Pop Moments Deluxe: Pokemon - Starters - Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle </h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Some bigger Funko sets are just worth every penny, such as one of the most nostalgic moments for ’90s kids. This represents a simpler time for me, and an iconic one for many that's been copied in some way, shape, or form in every Pokémon game since. Choosing your first-ever starter Pokémon is a big deal, and looking at this display piece just makes me smile. I picked Bulbasaur, and I will die on that hill.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Pokémon Funko Pops</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">From giant Funko Pops to double packs and single Pops, there's something here for every Funko and Pokémon fan. Just be careful: if you're buying someone their first Funko and you're financially responsible for them, you're on a slippery but extremely fun hobby.</p></div><p id="squishmallows"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Squishmallows">Pokémon Squishmallows</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Squishmallows are the softest and most cuddly Pokémon plushies you can get, and they come in various shapes and sizes. They're super high quality and hardwearing, too, so they're perfect for little trainers as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">20-Inch Sprigatito Pokémon Squishmallow</h3><div catalogid="8c2b65e5-eb62-4ba4-9042-a68913f09135" id="233668"><div id="233668" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Squishmallows Original 20in Sprigatito Pokémon Plush</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sprigatito is one of the Paldean starters from the Scarlet and Violet games I mentioned above, and it's an awesome Grass-type. This is a 20-inch one that's normally $69.99, but it's down to $37.99 for the holidays and a great deal.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Pokémon Squishmallows</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not into the Squishmallow versions of Pokémon, you can get the cuddly 10-inch full-body Pokémon, too, that are also currently on offer. There's Pikachu and Piplup available right now, but I can guarantee any Pokémon fan is going to love a Squishmallow to cuddle, even if they're too cool or grown up for one (I have five).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>For more </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/best-gift-ideas"><strong>gift ideas</strong></a><strong>, you may also enjoy our holiday shopping lists below:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-magic-the-gathering-gifts">Best MTG Gifts I'd Recommend for Any Fan</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-gifts-2024">Best Star Wars Gifts</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-gifts-2025">Best Nintendo Gifts</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gifts-for-gamers-2025">Best Gifts for Gamers</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-harry-potter-gift-ideas">Best Harry Potter Gifts</a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <guid>1383793</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's tough to really wrap your head around 2025 for Xbox. There were some real hits from Xbox Game Studios, fantastic day-one, third-party launches on Game Pass… and then a whole lot of baffling moves from Xbox as a platform, with multiple rounds of price increases, project cancellations, and layoffs. It was a year that constantly had our collective heads spinning. But hey, if you've been subscribed to Game Pass and playing on your Xbox Series X/S (or PC, or anything deemed an Xbox) this year, there was no shortage of great games to celebrate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here at IGN, we’ve voted across several categories for our end of the year awards, including our shortlist of the five best games that landed on Xbox in 2025. Those votes have determined the one winner that represents our pick for the best Xbox game of the year. With exclusives largely a thing of the past now, especially for Xbox – which published some high-profile games on PS5 this year – our contenders are simply what's been available on Xbox consoles this year, regardless of exclusivity or publishing status. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, let's get to it by first recognizing the honorable mentions that made Xbox's year one banger after another, and then revealing the Best Xbox Game of 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Xbox Game of 2025</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian had an all-time year with three launches in 2025, all of which hit in different ways. It gave a jolt to start the year with a tightly packed fantasy RPG in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> to stave off the appetite for a new Elder Scrolls, then brought its co-op survival sequel into early access with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a>, which got off to a great start. Compulsion Games weaved a unique artistic vision into a love letter to the American South with the action-adventure game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, while id Software brought us back to Hell with a bit of a melee twist on its shooter roots in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>. If Avowed wasn't enough, we kicked it like it was 2006 in Cyrodiil with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a>, which remindeding us that Bethesda’s long-running fantasy series had the sauce well before Skyrim. We busted out the notepads and corkboards for the roguelike puzzler <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">Blue Prince</a> that hit Game Pass on day one, but we also champed at the bit for more stylish action after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ninja-gaiden-2-black">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> whet our appetite for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, which Xbox published for Team Ninja. Oh yeah, and there's an Xbox handheld now with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/rog-xbox-ally">Asus ROG Xbox Ally</a> – well, sort of; rather it's an Xbox-branded PC handheld, that is arguably one of the best ones yet. And since everything is an Xbox now, it doesn't really matter where you play these hits. The sheer variety of games that launched under the Xbox banner this year was indicative of how vast and great the medium can be – and none represent that quite as well as our five best Xbox games of 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/best-xbox-hollow-knight-silksong-1765365891628.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems that every year has an indie darling that folks rally around loudly, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was certainly that game in 2025. The jokes about Silksong never coming out have finally been laid to rest, and Team Cherry's long development journey resulted in a dense, daunting, and satisfying action-adventure – or "metroidvania", if you will. While it hit Game Pass on launch, its impressive sales figures and $20 price tag made it the talk of the town... aside from it being the wildly anticipated follow up to Hollow Knight, of course. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On its own merits, Silksong's dark and foreboding atmosphere matches the gruesome platforming challenges that make its exploration more involved than many of its contemporaries. Hornet's traversal mechanics are smooth and will have you flowing through Silksong's sprawling, web-like map, leading you towards some of the hardest-fought battles we've experienced this year. Being smart, nimble, and aggressive against these tough and unpredictable bosses is the key to victory, but you must stay committed and locked in, try after try, even if the runback can be grueling. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But for as punishing as Silksong may be, it's also frequently adorable, blessed with cute, memorable bug friends like Sherma, who sings his song and is generally a precious little guy!  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Split Fiction</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/best-xbox-split-fiction-1765365921513.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming off of It Takes Two, which swooped in to secure Game of the Year back at The Game Awards 2021, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> continues developer Hazelight's catalogue of great split-screen co-op adventure games. Its premise – two novel writers trapped in their respective fictional worlds made manifest – paves the way for imaginative worlds and a mashup of gameplay mechanics and genres that are consistently exciting to play alongside a friend. Coordinating with your partner in puzzles, platforming, and high-speed action is a ton of fun as you phase in and out of fantasy and sci-fi worlds. Oftentimes it blends the two remarkably well, and packs in references that reflect where its two protagonists, Mio and Zoe, are as creatives (and, as any writer knows, that sometimes means they’re not very creative themselves.) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that's the thing about Split Fiction – art doesn't always have to be good, but it's the process through which art is created that should be respected, and that can't be treated as a commodity to be manufactured. And just when you think you had Split Fiction figured out, its finale delivers some of the most memorable sequences in recent memory, elevating the experience to one of the best games of this year. If you haven't played it yet, find a friend, give them the free co-op pass, and see what it's all about.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Keeper</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/best-xbox-keeper-1765365865292.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We hadn't heard from the team at Double Fine in quite some time after Psychonauts 2 headlined many best of lists back in 2021, but this year we got a pleasant surprise in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/keeper">Keeper</a>. Playing as a walking lighthouse may not seem too appealing on paper, but the Double Fine charm and distinct art style brings to life a world that's about showing rather than telling. Its puzzles have you looking at the environments with intent, and the little interactions you have with characters living in a seemingly abandoned world create tiny stories without having to say a word. Our review described Keeper as "a psychedelic exploration of life packed into a brief runtime" and it's a prime example of what a studio can do when left to its own creative devices – it's easygoing and impactful, and one of the standouts for 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - The Outer Worlds 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/the-best-xbox-game-the-outer-worlds-2-1765365942245.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Back when we saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> in action for the first time earlier this year, we could tell it had the makings of a top-tier Obsidian RPG. We liked the original entry well enough, but it was just as much an attempt to create a foundation for a new universe as it was the team trying to separate itself from Fallout and build atop the reputation it earned from New Vegas years ago. With this year’s sequel, it seems as if Obsidian recognized the shortcomings of The Outer Worlds and has addressed almost all of them, creating a sequel that delivers what the studio is known for: dense, story-driven RPGs with a whole load of interconnected systems that let you play exactly how you want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a concerted effort to improving gunplay and melee combat, which goes a long way in making its violent encounters a lot more fun. But it’s the deeper progression systems, along with intricate level design reminiscent of immersive sims like Deus Ex, that makes the overall RPG experience feel so much more dynamic. The game itself observes how you play, and offers tangible perks at the expense of some unusually creative debuffs as part of its Flaws system, with each one offered based on your actions. Such as system demonstrates in microcosm how The Outer Worlds 2 better accounts for your playstyle and shows you the consequences of how you interact with its world. And with a universe still rooted in dystopian satire, but with a good crew of companions and a tighter story told across much bigger worlds, The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian firing on all cylinders.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/best-xbox-clair-obscur-expedition-33-1765365967609.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps to the surprise of absolutely no one, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is IGN’s choice for the best game to hit Xbox this year. And if you're a Game Pass subscriber, you were treated to one of the best RPGs in recent memory on day one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its debut as a development team, Sandfall Interactive has drawn inspiration from classic Japanese RPGs (looking at Final Fantasy 10 and Persona 5 directly) to tell its own harrowing story about grief and the sometimes ugly ways it changes us. But while JRPGs are a clear influence, the studio’s French roots are significantly responsible for making Clair Obscur what it is, from its artistic vision to its storytelling style, right down to the unqiue music that both captures the hype of big boss fights and the atmosphere of its magical, painterly world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like any great RPG, Clair Obscur strives to give you an intimate understanding of its characters, drawing you in and making you feel for them in their moments of triumph and despair. It’s a credit to the studio's strong writing team, and performances from an incredible cast, that Expedition 33 is able to effortlessly pull you in through all the wild twists and turns of its story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a top-tier turn-based combat system, bolstered by timing-based inputs for attacking and defending. That active element keeps you locked in during each and every battle with an intensity you wouldn’t feel otherwise. The intricate progression and customization systems for each character make you feel like a genius tactician, creating the best builds for their unique moveset and mechanics. And damn does it look good when it all comes together. Clair Obscur is a wonderful example of executing on a clear creative vision while simultaneously recognizing what made its inspirations so great. And it very easily won the hearts and minds of us here at IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What was your favourite Xbox game of 2025?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Congrats on the new Divinity.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Did you see that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yup-that-weird-statue-was-teasing-a-new-divinity-game-the-game-awards-2025">Divinity reveal at The Game Awards</a> and think, hey, I really should get around to playing Divinity: Original Sin 2? Great news, Larian just made it a much nicer experience on modern consoles with a free upgrade for PS5, Xbox Series, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This was announced in a new trailer, which highlights the differences in the new versions. It's nothing too crazy - just better resolution and framerate. But it's free if you own the game already on any of the previous platforms (PS4, Nintendo Switch, or Xbox One) and it will hopefully bring the eight-year-old game up to par with current technology on consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't own the game already anywhere, now's probably a good time to grab it. At the time of this writing, it's on sale in a few places. It's 50% off if you buy the regular NIntendo Switch edition down to $25, and then you get the free upgrade on Switch 2. On Xbox, it's down to $17.49. If you own the game on PC, don't worry, as you don't need an upgrade. You're already set with a great version of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Divinity: Original Sin 2 is fantastic and well-worth checking out if you haven't yet. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/01/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition-review">gave the most recent Definitive Edition in 2018 at 9.6/10</a>, saying it's "a new way to play one of the absolute best RPGs in years. And whether you’re diving back in on PC, or booting it up on the console for the first time, it’s flexibility, personality, and charm make for an amazing adventure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also may be worth checking out before the new Divinity comes out, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yup-that-weird-statue-was-teasing-a-new-divinity-game-the-game-awards-2025">Larian has said</a> that players of Original Sin 1 and 2 might "be able to enjoy greater understanding and continuity."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
