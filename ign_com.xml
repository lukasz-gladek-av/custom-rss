            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grow a Garden has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grow-a-garden-summer-update-propels-roblox-game-to-astonishing-concurrent-player-record-dwarfing-even-fortnite-here-are-all-the-details">quickly become one of the biggest games</a> of 2025. The Roblox farming simulator first launched back in March and has seen rapid success thanks to various updates and events since then. The overwhelming interest in this Roblox game has shown no signs of slowing down, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/Chris_P._Bacon_Cooking_Event_Quests_and_Rewards">latest  cooking-themed event</a> has only fueled it further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that the game has entered further into the mainstream, we're already starting to see unofficial merch become available. A third-party seller on Amazon called VatanFari has a variety of Grow a Garden plushies for sale based on the pets from the game. The product pages for these plushies claim to be "drawing inspiration" from the Grow a Garden universe.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Grow a Garden Plushies at Amazon</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a ton of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/All_Pets,_Pet_Eggs,_Abilities,_and_Traits#All_Pets_and_Their_Abilities_in_Grow_a_Garden">pets available in Grow a Garden</a>, but only a select few are available in plushie form so far. There's the more traditional animals like a Chicken and a Racoon as well as rarer options such as the Disco Bee. Despite the lack of choices, however, the Chicken Zombie that was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/How_to_Get_Chicken_Jockey_in_Grow_a_Garden_-_Chicken_Zombie_Pet">part of a limited-time giveaway</a> is included here as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of the Grow a Garden-inspired plushies are available in a 10-inch size and cost around $18. The exception is the Chicken Zombie one that sits at 12-inches thanks to the little jockey. It's also quite a bit more expensive at $30. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as I can tell, there isn't any "official" merch yet available for Grow a Garden. For now third-party sellers on sites like Amazon or Etsy appear to be ramping up offerings as the latest Roblox sensation continues to take root.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Is VatanFari a trustworthy seller?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the dangers of buying from third-party sellers on Amazon is that the products <em>might</em> not end up being of the highest quality. That being said, VatanFari appears to have a decent <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rainbow-Monkey-Preferred-Birthdays-Purple/dp/B0BL3LHV3V/?th=1#averageCustomerReviewsAnchor" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">track record of reviews on some of its other offerings</a>. And plushies are a pretty low-risk item to order from Amazon. All of the options available from this brand offer <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKM69DUUYKQWKWX7&amp;ref_=dp_ret_policy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon's 30-day refund/replacement window</a> that you can take advantage of.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/grow-a-garden-plushies-are-already-available-to-buy-on-amazon]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guilty-gear-strive-producer-on-lucy-upcoming-balance-changes-and-strive-2-00-evo-2025.1263984/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">More than four years after it's release, Guilty Gear Strive is still going strong, with perhaps its most prolific DLC character yet, Lucy from Cyberpunk, releasing on August 21 as the final part of Character Pass 4. But that's not the only exciting thing going on in the world of Guilty Gear. During the finals of Strive at Evo, there was a trailer announcing a mysterious new chapter called Guilty Gear Strive 2.00, with two silhouhettes of characters that clearly indicate that longtime favorites Robo-Ky and Jam Kuradoberi are going to be making their way into Strive's ever growing roster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To get some details on Strive's future, I caught up with Ken Miyauchi at the show so I could pick his brain on all of these points and more. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>[Editor's Note: This interview has been lightly edited for grammar and clarity]</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So at finals for EVO 2025, you guys revealed Guilty Gear Strive 2.00. Can you tell us a little bit about what's going to be in that version? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ken Miyauchi, Producer on Guilty Gear Strive: </strong>Yes, we just announced a teaser trailer of something showing the version 2.00. We are not really particularly explaining what's in 2.00, but there's a reason behind why we show the number 2.00. We want to provide new, more exciting content toward Guilty Gear Strive and I'm expecting to show more details in the near future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>We also saw two silhouettes of characters that are going to be coming to Guilty Gear Strive 2.00. It seems like it's going to be Jam and Robo-Ky. Can you talk a little bit about those two characters?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So yeah, we are showing that we are still working on developing more additional characters. Of course, Lucy is coming out in August 21st, but we are still continuing developing more character updates and those are going to be the two characters that we are currently working on. So please stay tuned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What can you tell us about Lucy and what her play style is going to be? Obviously she uses strings from Cyberpunk, but can you give us a little taste of what she is going to be like in Strive?</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>Yeah, I think people are watching the trailers and trying to find out what she's doing and one of the biggest core mechanics that a lot of players might be very excited to see is her Quickhack move, which is really directly inspired from the Cyberpunk 2077 game mechanic. So we made it visually look very like the Cyberpunk 2077 Quickhack. And she has very, very unique moves that go along with that Quickhack. So the way she fights is going to be very unique, even compared to the entire Guilty Gear Strive cast. So yeah, I hope everyone enjoys her when she's out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Another thing that's coming to Guilty Gear Strive is going to be the ranked mode. What can you tell us about how the ranked mode will be in Guilty Gear Strive and how it's going to be different from the regular tower format?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So yeah, I explained this in our own website column, Developer's Backyard. So if you want to find out more details about the rules of how you earn points and how you get ranks and what kind of variety of ranks you have, <a href="https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/news/post-2550/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>you can check that out</u></a>. And so it's pretty much a regular standard rank match system that we've been also doing, and I think all other fighting games were also doing. We have battle points that you climb up together whenever you win a match and depending on your battle points, you will have higher ranks, and you get to the top, which is the rank called Vanquisher. You'll get into a rating match, almost like a master rank kind of, a rating match. So people who are playing really competitively can keep grinding to compete in the rating ranking and try to aim to the top of the ranking. And there is of course rewards to it. So I hope everyone who plays regularly will enjoy playing this mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Ranked Match we also have several features that people would be excited. I mean, I hope they appreciate is that we also have the Wi-Fi indicator and also if there's a bad ping match-up goals, you will be able to vote a no contest. So those kinds of features will also be included. So I hope you find out how you can use those features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So you're also looking to make adjustments to things like RISC, Wild Assault, and I believe Guard Crush is another thing. Can you tell us a little bit about specifically what kind of changes you're looking to make about those mechanics?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So yeah, we also announced that we are working on the battle balance patch and that's also coming out along with the Lucy character update. And so we are kind of trying to see the game balance and trying to incorporate a lot of player's feedback regarding how Guilty Gear Strive is currently playing. And we think there needs to be some tone downs on several, how do I say… the game mechanics, general game mechanics, the tools that everyone has access to. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We think there needs to be some tone downs on several game mechanics, or tools that everyone has access to. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And so there are lots of toning downs, but at the same time we also want to focus on the character uniqueness and making sure that characters can play how they would like to be played. And I think we had a lot of feedback from players that the current version of Guilty Gear Strive is in favor of those characters who have more access to those game mechanics. So not too much relying into the game mechanics and that's the direction of how we are balancing out for this patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So Arc System Works recently announced Marvel Tokon, and I think a lot of people are wondering, is there anyone from the Strive team that moved over to Marvel Tokon, or what is Strive's relationship with that game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>Well, I wish I can say anything about Marvel Tokon, but unfortunately I don't have a right to, and I honestly don't know much about Marvel Tokon because that's really a high-end secure project that's also internally in Arc System Works.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So no knowledge of Strive developers working on Marvel Tokon then?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>Well, we do have, it's a small company, so we do have a chat or discussion going on between teams. But yeah, that's everything that I can say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fair enough. So with each new update of Guilty Gear Strive, it feels like you're kind of going down a list and just kind of knocking off different features from 3v3 to now ranked mode. Are there any other kind of features that you want to add to Strive that are still on the list?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So we have a lot of things that we would like to do, which is also something that a lot of players has been asking for and I can't share any details about it for now, but I'm hoping if I will be able to show that off in the next version of 2.00.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you ever see Guilty Gear changing direction from being a fighting game series or even just a spin-off to do something other than fighting games? Obviously Guilty Gear 2: Overture was an action adventure. Is there any kind of future for Guilty Gear that's not a 2D fighter, do you think?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>Well, I don't have any projected plan or anything that I can share for now, but as a producer I'm always interested to expand Guilty Gear as an IP to open to different genres so that people who are not fighting games would also get into the IP. So yeah, if I have a chance I would like to try on some different kind of genre. But yeah, I don't have anything to share right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

And while it's normal to have a few bugs any time new content comes out, 11.2 seems to be riddled with weirder problems than usual...including a goofy bug that's turning some players' banks German.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj43f4/bank_update_my_stuff_is_fine_but_it_is_now/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">German bug in particular</a> has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mixnow/so_are_anyone_elses_bank_tabs_in_german_as_well/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mivyy8/eu_all_my_bank_tabs_have_german_description_text/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several players</a> on English clients, not on EU servers. It's not game-breaking by any stretch - just odd. It changes the player's bank tabs to German language. Everything else is unaffected. Funnily enough, some players in other countries and languages are reporting the same bug, but with different languages, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj43f4/comment/n784o0j/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this German player who says their tabs are in French</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj43f4/comment/n7898w2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this person</a> playing on the English client from Poland who has French tabs, while their wife's are German.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not the only bug players are facing, though. I've experienced several myself <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1miwt6p/new_patch_bugged_quests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just questing in the new zone, K'aresh</a>, with quests not completing, disappearing from the questlog mysteriously, and certain interactable objects needing the game fully reloaded in order to be used. I also experienced a lot of disconnects last night, and I'm not the only one. Some people are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj68lh/bug_new_zone_has_bricked_2_of_my_characters_from/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">having trouble logging in at all</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are running into weirder bugs. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1miot5x/man_inflation_is_absolutely_hitting_everyone/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This person reports</a> that the game is trying to charge them 500,000 gold just to visit the Darkmoon Faire, which is...a <em>little </em>high. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1miuf7h/i_have_found_a_bug_with_bags_and_bank_storage_i/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another person found a bug</a> (which admittedly may be related to a downloaded mod) where their bags have somehow been increased to hold 98 items apiece - far more than any bag currently in the game actually allows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the moment, it's difficult to say if Ghosts of K'aresh is exceptionally buggy compared to other patch releases, or if it just feels bad in the moment because we're all eager to play as much as possible as fast as possible. Most likely, all of these issues will be fixed within a few days, or at minimum by next Tuesday's weekly game update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in the meantime, if you want to use your bank, you might need to brush up on your German.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most exciting games to watch at Evo 2025 was Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fatal-fury-pros-dramatic-reaction-to-losing-at-evo-2025-goes-viral-but-it-was-actually-10-years-in-the-making">From KojiKOG's memeworthy and dramatic reaction to his loss in top 8</a>, to the incredible grand finals betwen Go1 and ET, and all of the exciting moments in between. It was a great reminder of how much fun the game can be. While I wasn't able to talk to anyone from SNK at the actual show itself, Producer Yasuyuki Oda and Animator Masami Obari were kind enough to answer several questions of mine via email relating to the release of Ken in City of the Wolves and a few other topics that I felt would be of great interest to fans of SNK and fighting games in general.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One of the biggest surprises to me once I got my hands on with Ken is how similar to his SF6 counterpart he is, despite this being a completely different game. Can you talk a little bit about some of the challenges involving taking a beloved character from one series and making them fit under a whole new set of rules and mechanics?</strong><br>
<strong>Yasayuki Oda, Lead Producer on Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves:</strong> The biggest initial concern for us was finding how to bring Ken into the Fatal Fury gameplay system and world without compromising his identity as a character. Our development team has so many people that are passionate about the Street Fighter franchise, and I think their love and dedication to the series really shined through in all the little details we worked on for Ken. We slowly worked out over time how to incorporate Ken’s fast speed and flashy flame-based attacks into the system of City of the Wolves, constantly asking ourselves “What was missing?”, “What could we improve on?”, “What were Ken’s strengths and where could we leverage that?” After much repeated trial and error, this version of Ken finally took form. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ken is a character that’s always been very strong in Street Fighter 6, thanks to being able to convert most regular hits on block to a Jinrai Kick that forces some risky decision making on defense, a plus on block gap closer in his heavy dragonlash kick, on top of just having really good neutral buttons and a balanced tool kit. Were you ever concerned that some of these elements might make him a bit too strong in Fatal Fury?</strong><br>
<strong>Oda</strong>: As you said, bringing Ken over the same way he is in Street Fighter 6 would undoubtedly make him a strong character in City of the Wolves. Of course, we had to make careful adjustments as we adapted him to the game. Integrating mechanics like Braking and REV Accel were challenging, but I think we were able to highlight what makes Ken special while also giving fans a chance to experience a different playstyle within the systems of City of the Wolves. We’re looking forward to seeing what fans think and how they engage with this version of Ken. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>With Terry and Mai appearing in Street Fighter 6, and now Ken, and later Chun-Li coming to Fatal Fury, do you have any interest in working together with Capcom once again for another entry in the Capcom vs SNK series? Or is that a far off dream?</strong></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p><strong>That would be something, wouldn't it?</strong></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Oda:</strong> That would be something, wouldn’t it? However, there is nothing I can talk about at this moment. We are always happy to receive questions like this because it shows how enthusiastic the fans are for another Capcom vs. SNK. It’s a great source of motivation for us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How do you feel overall about guest characters in fighting games? Do you think it’s a healthy trend for the genre, and do you think we might see more in future SNK games, or even in future updates of Fatal Fury?</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Oda:</strong> I think it’s a great trend. Of course, it is important to respect the story and world of other games, but the introduction of guest characters has great potential for the future of fighting games to create new “chemical reactions.” That is to say, it can lead to unexpected outcomes and birth something new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for City of the Wolves, there are still characters we need to bring back before we start thinking about more guest characters. Please rest assured that we are putting all of our focus on that right now. Even after Mr. Big releases, there are still many new characters and new aspects of the game we are working on, so please look forward to them!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I know she’s still a bit of a ways off, and we’ve got Joe coming first, but can you share any details about Chun-Li’s appearance in Fatal Fury? Will it be similar to the approach of Ken, in that you’re looking to her iteration in Street Fighter 6 as a primary source of inspiration?</strong></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We have a few surprises and finer details we're planning to add. We're looking to make this version of Chun-Li a culmination of her past iterations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Oda:</strong> We are using her SF6 version as a base, but since many of our staff are fans of the entire Street Fighter series, we have a few surprises and finer details we’re planning to add. We’re looking to make this version of Chun-Li, like Ken, a culmination of all her past iterations, so please look forward to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>For Obari-san, what was it like getting to create the animations for such an iconic character that’s outside of the world of SNK, like Ken. Were there any kinds of signature touches you felt like you were able to add, or did you try to keep things as close to the source as possible? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Masami Obari, Animator on Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves:</strong> First of all, I would like to say that it was a great honor to work on this project. I am extremely grateful to Capcom for this opportunity. As for the original elements, I would say the most work went into designing these characters in my style. I’d like to call it Bari-Ken! (Haha). It was extremely fun to draw Ken within the style and animation of the Fatal Fury anime.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are there any dream crossovers that you’d like to work on, either within the realm of fighting games or outside of it? </strong></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p><strong>I would be extremely happy to see a collaboration with a real pro wrestler. </strong></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Obari</strong>: I’m a huge pro wrestling fan, so I would be extremely happy to see a collaboration with a real pro wrestler. In terms of fighting games, I would be excited to see a crossover with Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer, a game I was originally in charge of the story and character design!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And finally, canonically, who do you think would win in a fight between Ken and Terry?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Obari:</strong> To be honest with you, I think Terry would win. I think they are evenly matched in terms of strength, but Terry is carrying a lot on his shoulders, and his will is strong because of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, as a director of the anime, I would prefer not to decide and have the two work together to fight a common enemy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.
