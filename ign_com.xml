It's available at no extra cost to anyone who owns Astro Bot but requires completion of the base game to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Since releasing Astro Bot earlier this year on PlayStation 5, we have been submerged by lovely comments from you and the PlayStation community, and we are delighted with the critical response to the game all over the world," said Nicolas Doucet, studio director of developer Team Asobi.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/11/astro1-1733929925771.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Winter Wonder in Astro Bot (Image Credit: PlayStation)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"From the bottom of our hearts, thank you so much for showing your appreciation. It truly means a lot to us. As our way of saying thank you, it is my pleasure to announce that a whole new piece of free additional content is coming to Astro Bot. Indeed, the little robotic elves of Team Asobi have been very busy preparing a whole new level called Winter Wonder."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doucet didn't share much on what fans can expect of the new level, though a single screenshot shows a festive world with a large Christmas tree at its centre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Since we want it to remain a little surprise, we will not say too much, but you should expect a fun-filled level with shiny presents, a good dose of jingle bells, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-players-expect-more-dlc-as-unreleased-bots-still-remain-in-the-credits">brand-new special bots to add to your crew</a>," Doucet said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This winter update was made with every user in mind, meaning it is a celebration enjoyable for children and adults alike. So, no hair-pulling challenge this time," he added, likely referencing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-confirms-astro-bot-post-launch-speedrun-levels-and-special-bots-release-schedule">the previous series of speedrun challenges released as downloadable content</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-exclusive-astro-bot-sells-15-million-in-2-months">Astro Bot sold 1.5 million units in its first two months</a> on sale and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">earned a 9/10 in IGN's review</a>. "A fantastically inventive platformer in its own right, Astro Bot is particularly special for anyone with a place in their heart for PlayStation," we said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
