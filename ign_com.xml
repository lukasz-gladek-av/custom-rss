"If you follow, you're going to watch an old guy work out. That's all it is. My plan is to get ripped, though. You can do it with me if you want."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/09/gettyimages-2179647401-1733752045687.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Red Dead Redemption actor Rob Wiethoff. Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images for ReedPop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He warned he's by no means an expert, however. "I am not certified or even trained in any kind of physical training nor am I an educated or certified dietician," Wiethoff said on his OnlyFans page. "If you decide to do what I do and eat what I eat, that’s up to you. I’m certainly not asking for you to do either of those things or even suggesting that you do. This is for fun. I hope we all enjoy it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His first post on OnlyFans asked fans if they're ready for it, and if he's ready for it. Wiethoff's second and latest post chronicles his water drinking philosophy for the day while explaining his eating habits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The actor plays one of the most iconic roles in video games as the protagonist of Red Dead Redemption and a main character of its sequel, both of which have gone down among the greatest games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-review">In our 10/10 review of the second</a>, IGN said: "Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open-world ode to the outlaw era."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-parody-grand-taking-ages-vi-pops-up-on-the-playstation-store-once-again-reminding-us-that-curation-basically-doesnt-exist<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A Grand Theft Auto 6 parody “game” has appeared on the PlayStation Store, once again calling into question Sony’s curation — or lack thereof — on its own storefront.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Taking Ages VI, supposedly due out May 2025 and actually available to wishlist, uses what looks like AI-generated art to satirize the ongoing wait for Rockstar’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. The <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013590" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Store page</a> also features fake selling points and even fake awards from video game websites, including IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Most Anticipated Game About Making The Most Anticipated Game!” reads the game page. “You're now in charge of the biggest gaming disaster... Or masterpiece? Run your dream game studio while juggling angry fans, corporate chaos, and endless delays. Fight your way through gaming conventions, dodge ruthless journalists, and master the art of creative excuses.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/09/gta-1733750215619.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grand Taking Ages VI is meant to be a parody of GTA 6. Image credit: PlayStation Store.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Taking Ages VI is supposedly inspired by real gaming industry events, and “delivers a satirical take on game development and the endless wait for certain highly anticipated titles.” It promises a release before October 2025, or before when the developer expects Grand Theft Auto 6 to come out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of the developer, the PlayStation Store page mentions Violarte sp. z o. O., which appears to be a Polish company. The website for Violarte was only created recently, and contains fake games and awards as well as what look like fake employees visualized either with stock photos or generative AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Sony and Violarte for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Grand Taking Ages VI should obviously not be taken seriously, its appearance on the PlayStation Store does call into question Sony’s curation process. The PlayStation Store has seen a number of questionable games over the years, but all the major video game storefronts struggle with this issue. The likes of Steam, the various app stores, and even the Nintendo eShop are packed with slop. And who can forget God of War rip-off War Gods Zeus of Child, which appeared on the Xbox store back in 2022?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Grand Taking Ages VI, its appearance on the PlayStation Store is likely not long for this world. “In memory of those who didn't have a chance to live till this moment (and those who gave up waiting and bought a PS6 instead),” the description concludes. “PS6 doesn't exist yet, but by the time some games release, it probably will.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6, meanwhile, launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S in the fall of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Others, however, believe the bottom left 'finger' is simply flesh falling off the little finger above it, although there are irregularities with the present boxes and ribbons in the bottom right, too. Generative AI often struggles with hands, adding extra fingers where they shouldn't be.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/09/share-20241206-1244480-1-1733745842140.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Black Ops 6's 'Necroclaus' loading screen. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another image of a gloved hand was used to show off a new Zombies community event. It contains what looks like six fingers with no thumb on-screen, suggesting up to seven digits on this hand.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/09/share-20241206-1244200-1-1733745876407.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The central image includes a gloved hand with some odd things going on. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Activision for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of the Zombie Santa image sparked a closer look at other images in Black Ops 6, which some in the Call of Duty community have now called into question. Redditor Shaun_LaDee highlighted three images included in paid bundles that have irregularities that could suggest the use of generative AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are now calling on Activision to disclose the use of generative AI for art that is included in bundles that are sold. And as others have pointed out, Steam operator Valve now has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI disclosure rules</a> that call on publishers and developers to describe how they use AI in the development and execution of their games. As part of this, Valve has told developers it will include their disclosures on the Steam store page of their game, “so customers can also understand how the game uses AI.” Currently, Call of Duty’s Steam page has no such disclosure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wired</a> reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-reportedly-sold-an-ai-generated-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-cosmetic">Activision sold an “AI-generated cosmetic” for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 last year</a>. The cosmetic in question was not named, but was linked to the Yokai’s Wrath bundle released in December 2023. The store did not disclose any use of generative AI for this bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle cost 1,500 COD Points, the premium virtual currency sold for real-world money that generates hundreds of millions of dollars for Activision each year. 1,500 COD Points is approximately valued at $15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wired pointed out that Microsoft, which owns Activision Blizzard after its $69 billion acquisition of the company last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce"><u>cut 1,900 staff from its gaming business</u></a> just months after Activision sold this skin. The report alleged that 2D artists’ jobs were being replaced by AI at the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of 2D artists were laid off,” one anonymous Activision artist told the site. “Remaining concept artists were then forced to use AI to aid in their work.” Activision employees were allegedly “made” to sign up for AI training, with its use promoted throughout the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. Generative AI thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Players will also compete for bragging rights, however, as a handful of new emblems are awarded to those able to win again and again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Versus Battle page once again includes an Event Match option that lets players compete for these emblems. Those able to win two matches in a row will earn the purple Participation Emblem, those who win three matches in a row will earn the Bronze Emblem, four matches nets the Silver Emblem, and five nets the Gold Emblem.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Genetic Apex</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Regular rewards don't require consecutive wins, as event missions have been added to award the aforementioned Pack Hourglasses and Shinedust.
