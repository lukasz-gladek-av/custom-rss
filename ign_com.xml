            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is having another one of its "<a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjONe?object_uuid=74b18853-6a80-450b-b150-73f3aece1d26&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Buy 2 Get 1 50% Off</strong></a>" sales and it is absolutely filled to the brim with puzzles this time around. There are hundreds of options included in this sale from some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">best puzzle brands</a> out there. If you're on the hunt for your next puzzle, or are just looking to grab a nice gift for the puzzler in your life, this promotion makes it a great time to save some money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To take advantage of the promotion, you'll just need to add two eligible jigsaw puzzles to your Amazon cart and the 50% discount will be applied to whichever one is the least expensive. And since it isn't just puzzles included (there are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-buy-1-get-1-half-off-board-game-sale-october-2025">board games as well</a>), you can also mix and match with other items to still get that discount. I've gathered some of my top picks from this sale below, but there's a ton of other options available if you want to browse the sale yourself.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Jigsaw Puzzle Sale on Amazon Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like I mentioned above, there are a <em>ton</em> of puzzles included in this sale. I couldn't possibly include them all, so I've only highlighted a few top picks that I think best represent what is included here. There's a fairly wide variety of piece counts, from 300 to 3000, but I mostly stuck to 1000-piece puzzles here as they are the most popular whenever I've covered a puzzle sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are looking for some suggestions for what to buy, the Spider-Verse puzzle from Buffalo games has been on our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzles-for-adults">best puzzles for adults</a> for over a year now. It's got a ton of different Spideys and is consistently one of the most popular marvel puzzles out there. There's also the Disney &amp; Pixar Shop puzzle from Ravensburger that offers something similar for fans of Disney instead of Marvel. There's a bunch of characters and easter eggs hidden in each one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'd also recommend checking out The Drippy Trip puzzle. It's the latest puzzle made by The Magic Puzzle Company and actually <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-series-five-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzle-features-art-from-an-adventure-time-designer">features a few fun secrets</a> from the popular cartoon Adventure Time. If you aren't familiar with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzles">Magic Puzzle Company Puzzles</a>, they are a mix between jigsaw puzzle and magic kit and are generally very popular with families. There have been five different series of these types of puzzles and Amazon has a bunch of them featured in this sale right now.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Board Games Are Also Included</h3><div catalogid="c50f91cc-9caf-48e8-84b9-2ba2d04822db" id="229501"><div id="229501" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buy 1 Get 1 50% Off Board Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon's buy 1, get 1 50% off sale also extends to board games. So if you want to purchase a puzzle <em>and</em> a board game you can still get that 50% off. There are a surprising number of board games included in the sale and you can mix and match to your heart's desire. There's even some crossover between IP so you can purchase a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lord-of-the-rings-puzzles">Lord of the Rings puzzle</a> <em>and </em>a Lord of the Rings board game all at once if you want.</p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/tons-of-popular-jigsaw-puzzles-are-buy-1-get-1-half-off-at-amazon-today]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A ton of popular games are included.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon's October Prime Day has ended, but the online retailer is already offering a new "Buy 2, Get 1 50% Off" sale this week. There's a little bit of everything for everyone in here, from classic family games to modern party games. If you've been hoping to add some more board games to your tabletop collection, right now is a great time to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sale itself is fairly straightforward: Amazon has a big <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2XPE?object_uuid=36931a4c-0172-46ee-99b4-5d30882de1af&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>list of items that are included in the promotion</strong></a> and all you need to do is add two in your cart and the 50% discount will be applied to whatever the cheaper one is. That means if you want to take full advantage of the savings, you'll want to buy two similarly priced items. I've gathered some of the best board game options in the sale here, which are based off of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/board-game-reviews">IGN's own board game reviews</a> and recommendations. There are also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tons-of-popular-jigsaw-puzzles-are-buy-1-get-1-half-off-at-amazon-today">jigsaw puzzles included in the sale</a> if you want to mix and match for the full discount.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Buy 1, Get 1 50% Off Board Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The amount of options to choose from in this sale is truly staggering, and it's difficult to choose only a few recommendations to highlight. Are you looking for intriguing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-murder-mystery-board-games">murder mystery games</a> to play during a Halloween party? Do you need a fun <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board game</a> you can break out on weekends? Are you hoping to find a great <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy game</a> that will take all night to play? There are tabletop options for all of those scenarios right here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those working with a smaller budget, I'd recommend checking out Flip 7. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/flip-7-card-game-review">reviewed it earlier this year</a> and absolutely loved it. It's a fairly easy push-you-luck card game that can be played in under 20 minutes. At only $8, it's already cheap, and this promotion will end up dropping that price down to just $4 when you buy something else (that's at least $8) with it. All-in-all, it's an easy recommendation to make for anyone who just wants a fun game that has a shallow learning curve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for something a bit heartier that's still family friendly, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-board-game-buying-guide-and-expansions">Ticket to Ride</a> – both the original U.S. and some of the European versions – is also included here. This game is a modern classic that does a great job of combining simple gameplay with stimulating turn-based strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you find a game you like, the next step is picking out a good second option to take full advantage of the discount. I'd recommend browsing through some of the classic board games here that are essential for any collection, stuff like Clue, Catan, Sorry!, and multiple versions of Monopoly. If you don't already have those, now is a great time to pick one or more up for a substantial discount.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Is Now a Good Time to Buy Board Games?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week we saw some pretty <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/board-game-deals-october-prime-day-2025">great board game deals for October Prime Day</a>, but with that sale over and Black Friday on the horizon, you may be wondering if you should be making a purchase right now. While it's true that Amazon will likely have better board game deals for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday">Black Friday</a> this year, this buy 1, get 1 50% off sale is still a great way to save money right now. If you are looking to grab some stocking stuffers or a family game to play <em>before</em> the holidays, then this sale makes it a good time to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that in mind, you'll still want to wait for better discounts if you're planning on making bigger purchases. Some of the bigger campaign board games that are $100 or more are not included in this sale and aren't likely to be discounted until November.</p></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 13, 2025 7:42 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-buy-1-get-1-half-off-board-game-sale-october-2025]]></content:encoded>

As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-off-to-huge-start-on-steam-with-over-740000-concurrent-players-just-hours-after-launch">more than 740,000 players gathered to play on Steam alone</a>, a new discussion about in-game classes has bubbled to the top with one question: are medics doing their job?</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Revive in Battlefield 6 (animation)<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Battlefield</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Battlefield6</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/NeebsOfficial?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@NeebsOfficial</a> <a href="https://t.co/RM5RHclAfX" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/RM5RHclAfX</a></p>— SiegeTales (@SiegeTales) <a href="https://twitter.com/SiegeTales/status/1976610593843868039?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Support class no doubt plays an important role in any Battlefield 6 multiplayer match. While Assault, Engineer, and Recon classes, too, bring important tools and skills to a fight, it’s only the Support class that can get downed soldiers back on their feet at lightning speed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Squad mates of any class are free to revive each other with or without the medic tools in Support, though they are locked only to reviving players in their squad and take much longer to pick them up. Support players do not have these squad limitations and can instantly revive a soldier with things like defibrillators.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With dozens of teammates in every Battlefield 6 match, there’s always plenty of players looking to be revived, and as buildings are often crumbling down around them, the chances of being picked up aren’t always too likely. Heightening the stress on both ends are measurements for downed players showing how far away the nearest group of medics is. When JohnBattlefield2000 opts not to revive you at just five meters away, things tend to get a bit heated.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some have already begun using the repair tool, a gadget wielded by engineers to repair vehicles (and draw on walls) in Battlefield for years, to leave messages for Support medics who neglect their fallen comrades.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest Steam Next Fest began this week, showcasing a wide range of upcoming titles. And as has become a trend, publishing platform <a href="https://indie.io/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>indie.io</u></a> has several titles featured. To celebrate, it has launched a campaign called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/indieio/sale/next_fest_party_indie_io" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Next Fest Party</u></a> that will run from October 13–20 and includes free demos for 12 different games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The games come from a variety of different developers in a variety of different genres, so we figured we’d give you a rundown of everything that’s available. Below you’ll find brief descriptions of each game, with each title linked to its free demos so you can try them for yourself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3772390/Monsters_and_Me_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Monsters and Me</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This 2D top-down roguelite shooter is chaotic, silly, and a bit gross (well, as gross as a 2D game can be). Your city has been overrun with slime mutants who have one goal in mind: ripping your face off. The natural reaction should be to prevent that, so you’ll need to upgrade your weapons and special abilities to fend off the horde. The demo drops you into the game’s first level, and you just need to survive as long as you can. Simple, right?</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3694540/Kriophobia_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Kriophobia</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Kriophobia also challenges you to survive, but in a VERY different way. You play as Anna, a geophysicist who’s trapped in a frozen Soviet bunker … and something else is down there with you. This is classic psychological horror, perfect for spooky season and for players who don’t want their hands held. Combat is tense and difficult, to the point it’s sometimes best avoided altogether. The demo is a standalone section of the game’s second chapter, where you’ll have to contend with the cold, mysterious abominations, and Anna’s traumatic past.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3931400/PLAGUN__The_Plague_Goes_On_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Plagun</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This pixel shooter is a bullet-hell roguelike set in a post-apocalyptic kingdom where an attempted cure for death resulted in an all-consuming plague instead. You were a doctor before this event, but now you must use cursed masks and plague-infused weapons to deal with escalating waves of enemies. The demo is a vertical slice that will give you a sense of the game’s fast pace and let you experiment with different cursed masks and power-ups.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2237320/Dwarf_Delve/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Dwarf Delve</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s time to pick up your Battlemallet, go delving into mines, and try to safely make it out with as many riches as you can in this first-person extraction roguelite. The mines are randomly generated, so no two trips are the same. You’ll need to craft items like support beams and ladders to traverse dangerous areas, as well as utilize lanterns and floodlights to see in the darkness. Once you’ve grabbed your loot, you’ll need to be wary of traps and other dangers on your way back to safety. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2492980/Heistfest_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Heistfest</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you like stealing stuff and then causing untold destruction throughout the city as you try to make your escape while an escalating police force chases you? Well, great news. That’s the premise of the aptly named Heistfest. You’ll speed your way through hand-drawn environments, and things will get more intense the longer you evade capture. And if you think that means just adding some more cop cars and maybe some guns, think again. You’ll have to deal with spike traps, helicopters, paratroopers, tanks, and full-on airstrikes. Chaos and fun are more important than realism anyway. The demo is a vertical slice that gives you a sense of the core gameplay loop: rob a bank, spark a police chase, and see how long you can survive as public enemy #1.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3330930/Locked_in_my_Darkness_2_The_Room/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Locked in My Darkness 2: The Room</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s Halloween time, so of course there can’t just be one scary game on this list. This one is a psychological horror walking sim focused on atmosphere, exploration, and puzzle solving. You play as Yuki Tachibana, a Japanese high school student who recently moved into a new apartment with her family. Something sinister awakens within the walls of their new home, warping reality and dredging up sins of the past. With flashlight in hand, you’ll uncover notes, solve environmental puzzles, and reveal the secrets of Yuki’s family.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3392150/Nullstar_Solus_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Nullstar: Solus</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You are Solus, a scavenger drone sent to salvage the nullstar from a dying world. But there’s only one goal that really matters in this game: be faster. You’ll need to master the flying mechanics, thrusters, and momentum to make it through levels as quickly as possible. Those levels are high-risk, high-reward, and you’ll need to stay on your toes to deal with everything they can throw at you.  </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3544390/Air_Hares/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Air Hares</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You probably haven’t seen a bullet hell quite like this one. In Air Hares, your main goal isn’t shooting enemies out of the sky; it’s using your plane to seed and water crops to save the starving people of the barren Winrose Warren. But your feathered foes in the Gale Gang want to stop you, so you’ll need to dodge, jab, and ram them to send them packing and get back to your important work. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1908520/Binary_Golf_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Binary Golf</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Miniature golf gets a chaotic overhaul in Binary Golf, where you use your golf ball to eliminate targets until the final one becomes the hole you need to get your ball into. But this isn’t just any old mini golf course. You can jump over hazards, teleport across courses, and phase through objects to pull off trick shots. The demo includes the game’s first two episodes, which will teach you the ropes before pitting you against a boss to test what you’ve learned.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong></strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3553150/The_Cascadier/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">The Cascadier</a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve ever wondered what would happen if a roguelike deckbuilder collided with a magical coin-pusher machine, The Cascadier has your answer, and it’s gloriously chaotic.<br>Each run has you charging coins with elemental powers from your deck and dropping them into dazzling, pinball-like cabinets that erupt in chain reactions if you drop your coin just right. You’ll be guided by Fortuna, the trickster goddess of luck, and her envious brother Theodan as you chase divine rewards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each round starts with ten coins to drop and your deck of earned abilities. Like any good coin pusher, you’ll scoop up coins mid-round and play them back in to keep your score and ticket count climbing. Run out, and the round’s over, so make every toss count. Hit your score goal to move on, then choose new powersets to add to your growing deck and mix things up in the next run. You’ll spend your hard-earned tickets on upgrading Trinkets that grant new abilities and permanent boosts. The demo lets you try the first cabinet,  a lush, nature-themed machine that hints at the elemental powers each new board will bring.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1075880/Elemental_Brawl/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Elemental Brawl</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A multiplayer party game, Elemental Brawl tasks you with beating up your friends with the power of the elements. Each round begins with everyone only being able to punch and kick, but as time goes on, random elemental orbs will drop. Collecting them grants you powers related to that element, and you can combine elements as the round continues. And the maps aren’t static, you can use your elements to burn them, freeze them, turn puddles into steam traps, and more. It’s all about coming up with creative ways to eliminate your opponents.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2944590/Chowdown_Kitty/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Chowdown Kitty</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A puzzle game with simple yet addictive gameplay, Chowdown Kitty presents you with a board filled with cat treats. Connect matching treats in a string of three or more, and those treats get pulled out and put in a food bowl for a cat. The more treats you manage to string together, the higher your score gets and the happier the cat gets.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/12-free-demos-for-indieio-games-available-now-as-part-of-steam-next-fest-party]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">And claims surrounding Gen 10.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A year on from the infamous "Teraleak," further data hacked from the servers of Pokémon developer Game Freak has spread online — this time focused on the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The content includes screenshots and gameplay videos that appear to show work-in-progress beta builds of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, including various features, mechanics and mini-games that fans say are not present in the final game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of further data from the Teraleak, just days before the official launch of Pokémon Legends: Z-A for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, is particularly eye-opening — as the suggestion here is that hackers held these files back from last year's deluge of details until the franchise's new game was (nearly) released. It also suggests that Nintendo's attempts at locating the hackers have not been successful — despite an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-requests-subpoena-of-discord-to-track-down-user-behind-last-years-pokemon-teraleak">legal bid by the company to subpoena Discord</a> to divulge the hackers' identity in April this year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's release of hacked Pokémon Legends: Z-A information comes after days of leaks from players with early copies — legitimate and not — that have laid the new game's Pokédex bare, including a long list of fresh Mega Pokémon species. Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-datamining-begins-fans-warn-that-the-pokmon-legends-z-a-spoiler-floodgates-have-now-opened">IGN warned that the floodgates had opened on spoilers</a>. As of today, fans reckon they've compiled a list of every Pokémon getting a Mega Evolution not just in the base game, but also in Legends: Z-A's post-launch DLC, which is already available to pre-order.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the game's biggest secrets now available to view online for those who wish to go find them, it seems like the Teraleak hackers have decided now is the time to release what they have had on Pokémon Legends: Z-A — and it looks like they're not stopping there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Teraleak hackers have <em>also </em>now begun to release information they say relates to Pokémon's fabled upcoming "Gen 10" games, which fans widely expect to arrive in 2026 in time for the franchise's 30th anniversary. But as claims of these games' names and settings swirl, it's worth pointing out that this information appears to rely on documentation that's several years' old — rather than actual gameplay footage, as is the case for Pokémon Legends: Z-A. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In October 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-developer-game-freak-reportedly-hacked-stolen-data-on-unannounced-games-as-well-as-nintendo-switch-2-codename-leaked-online">Game Freak issued a statement confirming the company had suffered a data breach</a> in August of that year, and noted that hackers had accessed the details of current and former employees. The company did not, however, comment on the spread of hacked game data taken from its servers. This included source code for numerous Pokémon games, unused assets that revealed scrapped Pokémon species, internal meeting notes and PowerPoint presentations, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dubbed the Teraleak by Pokémon fans, the hack rekindled memories of the infamous <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-gigaleak-everything-we-know-and-all-the-major-discoveries">Nintendo "Gigaleak" of 2020</a>, the largest leak of internal video game information ever released, which revealed previously unknown canceled games, prototypes, source code, development tools, and internal communications.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Nintendo and The Pokémon Company for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
