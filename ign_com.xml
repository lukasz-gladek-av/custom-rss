"I'm still playing now," he added. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/gettyimages-82648008-1770741008273.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ghost in the Shell director Mamoru Oshii. Image credit: Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what is the appeal of Fallout 4 to Mamoru Oshii? The 74-year-old called it a "game that seems to have been made for my own desires," and described how he wanders the ruins of the post-apocalyptic world carrying a rifle and accompanied by the game's canine companion, Dogmeat.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of Fallout 4, Oshi explains that he's also a big Hideo Kojima fan and plays every new game from the Metal Gear Solid creator — he recently finished playing Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, in which he actually appears as an NPC known as The Pizza Chef. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But for almost a decade, Oshi said he had followed a cycle where he breaks off from playing Fallout 4 to play Kojima's new game upon release, completes it, and then... returns back to Fallout 4 once more. "There are no other games I want to play," Oshii simply said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I once tried PUBG and racked up 250 hours," he casually noted, but said that he didn't really like online multiplayer games or first-person shooters that require quick reflexes. "They're not for me," he noted.  (He does recall taking a commemorative screenshot after getting a Chicken Dinner in PUBG, but only once.) "After all is said and done, I prefer playing games on my own," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Fallout 4 is just right," he continued. "Although it's an action game, as people who play it will know — it has the VATS system." Fallout's slo-mo aiming system allows even people who are no good at aiming to land shots, he suggested. "If the game didn't have this, I probably couldn't play it." </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout 4 Next-Gen Update Makeshift Weapon Pack Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mamoru Oshii previously revealed in great detail to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/yes-ghost-in-the-shells-director-is-obsessed-with-fallout-4-and-we-have-a-record-of-his-chaotic-escapades-in-the-game-penned-by-the-man-himself/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a> that he has a rather eccentric way of playing Fallout 4 - that he doesn't ally with any factions, and has ignored the main storyline in favor of spending hours on side quests and raids with Dogmeat as his sole companion. His playstyle seems to be that of a community-minded lone wolf, stripping all the gear off raiders and gunners. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a win-win," he noted, "I get to enjoy the pleasure of stripping scumbags naked while also contributing to the local community’s welfare." He's said that he is particularly hostile towards Brotherhood of Steel members (who he likens to Nazis) and always sneak kills whole units (at one point, he amassed so many Brotherhood of Steel Power Armors that he used them to build a moat). Back when he played on console, Oshii apparently gathered so much loot at his base that his PS4 struggled to run the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Around 4 years ago, I ran out of things to do (in Fallout 4)," Oshii explained. "So I installed mods." However, the Angel's Egg director noted that Fallout 4's new version (i.e. the 2025 Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition update) rendered his mods unusable. Upon launching Fallout 4 after the update, Oshii says that instead of his customized character, "some random bald guy wearing a suit suddenly appeared, and it took a lot of effort to get the game back to normal. I wish they'd stop changing things without asking."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

Sonic Frontiers was reviewed by writer Travis Northup, who said it's "an ambitious open-world adventure that mostly succeeds at mixing up the Sonic formula, even when some of its ideas fall flat."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter what kind of Sonic adventure you're looking to drop into, these offers seem well worth taking advantage of before they're gone.

Its story focuses on a pair of writers, Zoe and Mio, who become trapped in their interweaving sci-fi and fantasy narratives. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"An expertly crafted co-op adventure that pinballs from one genre extreme to another, Split Fiction is a rollercoaster of constantly refreshed gameplay ideas and styles – and one that’s very hard to walk away from," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">Split Fiction review</a>, awarding the game 9/10. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fares' previous game It Takes Two also proved popular, with its story focused on a husband and wife who plan to get a divorce. We called it "a beautiful, breakneck-paced, co-op adventure that’s bubbling over with creativity," in IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-two-review">It Takes Two review</a>, which also returned a 9/10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before that, Fares previously released prison escape adventure A Way Out, starring two convicts, and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, starring... two sons. Should Fares actually be making a three-player game, it would indeed be a break from the norm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

On consoles, pre-orders are available now, and physical editions will also be offered. Pre-orders unlock a free Deluxe Edition upgrade containing an outfit pack and collectables themed around the studio's past Dark Pictures games, a cinematic filter pack, plus a digital soundtrack and artbook.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starring Bond actress Lashana Lynch, Directive 8020 sees Until Dawn, The Quarry and Little Nightmares 3 maker Supermassive Games tackle sci-fi, in a story set on the crashed colony spaceship Cassiopeia.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Directive 8020 features various familiar hallmarks from past Supermassive games: multiple protagonists, choice-based gameplay, and the ability for main characters to die mid-story if you're not careful. But there are notable upgrades here too — which is part of the reason why the game has taken so long to launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In development since at least 2022, Directive 8020 marks a shift away from the studio's annual release pattern seen in previous The Dark Pictures Anthology titles. The game was previously announced for launch in October 2025, though was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-developer-blames-challenging-and-ever-evolving-environment-as-it-announces-layoffs-delays-long-awaited-next-horror-game-directive-8020-until-2026">pushed back due to the impact of a fresh wave of redundancies</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside improved visuals, controls and stealth mechanics, another new feature is the ability to rewind and revisit key "Turning Points" in the story to explore alternate storylines and potentially save character deaths. (For series veterans, an option to play without this will also be featured — ensuring your decisions stay final.) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Single-player and up to 5-player couch co-op will be available from launch on May 12, though online multiplayer will arrive in a free post-launch update. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Directive 8020 will arrive three and half years after the launch of the last main The Dark Pictures Anthology title, The Devil in Me. This time around, however, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/directive-8020-might-give-the-dark-pictures-saga-a-massive-upgrade">Supermassive has said Directive 8020 is planned to be even more standalone</a> (so don't expect to see much of the franchise's recurring Curator).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
