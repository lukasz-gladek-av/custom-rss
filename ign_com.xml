            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Let the games begin.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s nearly here: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-predictions-and-latest-news">Black Friday sales</a> are kicking off this week. And if you’re a fan of board games, you’ll probably want to have an idea of what to expect deal-wise on popular tabletop titles. You’ve come to the right place. I’m the board game editor at IGN, and I’ve been following all the Black Friday board game deals for years. Let’s dive in.</p><p id="buy-1-get-1-half-off-live-now"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Buy 1, get 1 half off - Live now">Buy 1, Get 1 Half Off on Board Games Right Now</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You don't actually have to wait for Black Friday to save on board games. Right now, both <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj7NOL?object_uuid=dbf6e013-25fa-4772-8a91-36f95d8a53bd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdp0jv?object_uuid=dbf6e013-25fa-4772-8a91-36f95d8a53bd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target</a> have sales that get you <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-buy-1-get-1-half-off-board-game-sale-ahead-of-black-friday-2025">half off a board game</a> when you buy one at regular price. This applies to a decent number of popular games for board games, including Catan, Splendor, and Horrified. But tons of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">classics</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board games</a> are also eligible, like Scrabble and Mouse Trap.</p><p id="what-games-will-get-discounts"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What games will get discounts?">What Games Will Get Discounts?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to Black Friday board game deals, such a wide swath of games go on sale each year that basically nothing is off the table (please excuse the pun). If this year is like years past, you’ll be able to save on just about every board game on the market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The discounts we saw last year ranged from 20% off games all the way up to 65% off. You could save on popular standards like Azul and Pandemic. You could save on family-friendly games like Exploding Kittens and UNO. You could save on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">horror-themed board games</a> like Alien: Fate of the Nostromo and Arkham Horror: The Card Game. Whatever games you're interested in, you can likely find something on sale that you'll want to pick up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, for Cyber Monday last year, Amazon ran a “Buy 2, Get 1 Free” sale. Since many of the games were already discounted, that was like a deal on top of a deal. So keep an eye out during Black Friday 2025 for opportunities to stack discounts.</p><p id="which-retailers-will-have-sales"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Which retailers will have sales?">Which Retailers Will Have Board Game Sales?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the retailers where the deals can be found, the main ones to look at are Amazon, Walmart, and Target. If you want to branch out a bit, Barnes and Noble is usually a good place to look for discounts as well. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-2025-start-date-and-sale-predictions">Amazon's Black Friday sale</a> kicking off on November 20 this year, that will likely be the first place you should start looking for deals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.
