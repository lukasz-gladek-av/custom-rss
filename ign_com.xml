            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Some deals just hit right, and today’s picks are genuinely worth a look. Assassin’s Creed: Shadows is down to $49.99 in its Limited Edition, M3GAN 2.0’s steelbook bundle is up for pre-order, and the WOWBOX drawer organizers are just $15.99 for a 32-piece set. Add in a reliable Coke Zero 12-pack deal and a surprisingly good rechargeable neck fan for $13.49, and it’s shaping up to be a smart day to grab a few things you’ll actually use.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s more, too. The Silmarillion deluxe illustrated edition is back in stock for under $83, and some early Prime Day offers are already rolling out. Audible Premium Plus is just $0.99 for three months, Kindle Unlimited is free if you’ve got Prime, and young adults can still claim six months of Amazon Prime at no cost. If you’ve been holding off, these are the kinds of practical, high-value deals that make it worth jumping in early.</p><p id="coke-zero-sugar-12-pack"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Coke Zero Sugar 12 Pack">Coke Zero Sugar 12 Pack</h2></p><div catalogid="bac8eeb1-cb76-4ce5-8784-e2fb014e64c5" id="223557"><div id="223557" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Coke Zero Sugar 12 Pack</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Use on-site coupon with the subscribe and save discount</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you change your mind and don't want to subscribe and save, you can still get this great deal on Coke Zero when you purchase. It's Coke with zero sugar, and there's 12 cans that you can drink out of and recycle (thumbs up).</p></div><p id="assassins-creed-shadows-limited-edi"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Assassins Creed Shadows Limited Edi"> Assassin's Creed: Shadows Limited Edition (PS5)</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223898"><div id="223898" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Assassins Creed Shadows Limited Edition (PS5 / Xbox Series X)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin’s Creed Shadows finally delivers the long-awaited leap into feudal Japan, and it doesn’t waste the opportunity. This Amazon-exclusive Limited Edition includes the full game plus the Sekiryu Character Pack, and it's now down to $49.99—29% off the original $69.99 price. You’ll switch between Naoe, a nimble shinobi, and Yasuke, a powerhouse samurai, across a moody and expansive Sengoku-era Japan. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-review">We praised the game’s dynamic environments</a>, more focused pacing, and demanding combat. It doesn’t reinvent the series, but it smartly trims the bloat while offering rich stealth and action-driven storytelling. At this price, it’s a sharp buy for any AC fan.</p></div><p id="m3gan-20-limited-edition-steelboo"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="M3GAN 2.0 - Limited Edition Steelboo">M3GAN 2.0 - Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital)</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223899"><div id="223899" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>M3GAN 2.0 - Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">M3GAN 2.0 dials up the chaos and trades in some of the original’s horror flair for a louder sci-fi action vibe. The Limited Edition Steelbook packs in 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and Digital formats for $37.99, with a pre-order guarantee that locks in the best price. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/m3gan-2-review-allison-williams-jemaine-clement">While we noted the sequel stumbles trying to balance satire and spectacle</a>, M3GAN still steals the spotlight with her savage wit and unpredictable presence. It may not reinvent the killer robot genre, but if you’re in for stylish carnage and sharp-edged commentary, this edition delivers plenty of polished personality for the price.</p></div><p id="wowbox-32-pcs-clear-plastic-drawer"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" WOWBOX 32 PCS Clear Plastic Drawer "> WOWBOX 32 PCS Clear Plastic Drawer Organizer Set</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223900"><div id="223900" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> WOWBOX 32 PCS Clear Plastic Drawer Organizer Set</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For $15.99, this 32-piece WOWBOX drawer organizer set is an easy win for cutting clutter across any room. You get four sizes of clear black bins, perfect for separating everything from office supplies to cosmetics and kitchen tools. The plastic is sturdy enough to handle daily use without cracking, and the stackable design lets you double your storage without taking up more space.</p></div><p id="tunise-rechargeable-portable-neck-fa"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tunise Rechargeable Portable Neck Fa">Tunise Rechargeable Portable Neck Fan</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223812"><div id="223812" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tunise Rechargeable Portable Neck Fan</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a fan that you don't have to hold because it sits comfortably around your neck. This is such a cool and handy product for under $15, especially if you're like me and get warm at the thought of some sunshine.</p></div><p id="the-silmarillion-deluxe-illustrated"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Silmarillion Deluxe Illustrated ">The Silmarillion Deluxe Illustrated by the Author</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223811"><div id="223811" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Silmarillion Deluxe Illustrated by the Author</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't describe how much I need this work of art. This edition of the Silmarillion arrives in a deluxe stamped clothbound hardcover edition housed in a custom slipcase and lavishly illustrated with over 50 color pieces by J.R.R. Tolkien himself. This collector's version presents the complete text in two-color print and includes exclusive extras like two fold-out maps of Beleriand, a booklet on the making of <em>The Silmarillion</em> by Christopher Tolkien, and a collectible art card. From the crafting of the Silmarils and Morgoth’s theft, to the fall of Númenor and the forging of the Rings of Power, this volume captures the vast mythological backdrop of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. Beautifully quarterbound with foil-stamped black cloth boards, silver-edged pages, and a ribbon marker, it’s a definitive edition for Tolkien devotees.

For more information about the event and an inside scoop on hot deals and top tips, check out our Prime Day hub.</p></div><p id="6-months-free-amazon-prime-for-young"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="6 Months Free Amazon Prime For Young">6 Months Free Amazon Prime For Young Adults</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223809"><div id="223809" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>6 Months Free Amazon Prime For Young Adults</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>$7.49 after free trial ends</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one is a no-brainer. If your 18-24, snap up this 6-months free deal for Amazon Prime. It includes the free and fast delivery Amazon is known for alongside unlimited streaming, free delivery on GrubHub+, free Prime games every month and loads more.
</p></div><p id="3-months-free-audible"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="3 Months Free Audible">3 Months for $0.99 Audible Deal</h2></p><div catalogid="bac8eeb1-cb76-4ce5-8784-e2fb014e64c5" id="223445"><div id="223445" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>3 Months Audible Premium Plus for $0.99</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Audible’s doing that 99c a month deal again for Premium Plus, and it’s a steal. Amazon Prime Members get three months free, so make sure to check for an active subscription before looking for this deal. You get three audiobooks to keep, full access to the big library, and it works even if you’ve had a sub before as long as it’s not active now. I just logged in, saw the banner, and grabbed it. <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em> is already in my library, and I’m eyeing that massive new Sanderson one next. Less than three bucks for all that? Easy win.</p></div><p id="3-months-free-kindle-unlimited"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited">3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited</h2></p><div catalogid="bac8eeb1-cb76-4ce5-8784-e2fb014e64c5" id="223446"><div id="223446" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve never really stuck with audiobooks before, but this Kindle Unlimited deal finally got me into them properly. Right now you can get three months free if you’ve got Prime, and it works on your phone or tablet, not just a Kindle. I gave it a go, downloaded a couple of books, and now I’ve actually started finishing them while I’m out walking or doing stuff around the house. It’s made getting through my backlog way easier and I didn’t have to pay a thing to try it. If you’ve been on the fence, this is a solid excuse to dive in.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Price Comparison</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the pricing here by Amazon is insane, but there's some deals to be had when comparing these products to TCG Player. For example, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7YM4?object_uuid=2e864453-2d87-404f-b835-32ee2b94096f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prismatic Evolutions Super-Premium Collection</a> is a massive 56% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xEG5?object_uuid=2e864453-2d87-404f-b835-32ee2b94096f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">market value</a>, so go with Amazon on that one. On the other end of the scale, TCG Player has <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnm1k?object_uuid=2e864453-2d87-404f-b835-32ee2b94096f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cynthia’s Garchomp ex Premium Collection</a> at a massive 48% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpXZv?object_uuid=2e864453-2d87-404f-b835-32ee2b94096f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon's current price</a>, which is very close to MSRP. I've compared all the prices in the carousel above, but another pro tip is clicking through to eBay to see if there's any new bargains to be had.
</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">This Weeks Pokémon Card Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been keeping a close eye on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-june-23">Pokémon TCG market this month</a>, and we’re seeing two very different stories unfold. On one side, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a> cards are going through a steep correction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Crown Zenith</a> cards are showing early signs of what could be a long-term value surge. The bottom line? If you're a collector or investor, <strong>now is the time to buy into both.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m picking up what I can from both sets. The current dip in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-booster-bundle-shining-fates-amazon-restock-latest">Sparks</a> is a glimmer of hope for long-suffering 2024-2025 collectors. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-card-packs">Crown Zenith</a> is a train I want to be on before it leaves the station.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Classic</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sam's Club Pokémon TCG Classic deal is back, and it's massively undercutting other big box retailers and the secondary market. Just for comparrison, the top four cards from this set, Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur and Mewtwo, are worth the same price as this discounted offer. This deal is well worth it and should be snapped up as soon as possible.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Mega Evolution Pokémon Cards Are Climbing</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"> I can't believe the X Y era of Pokémon cards came out 12 years ago, but it was an amazing era for the TCG introducing the Mega Evolution mechanic. Mega's will be returning later this year with the start of the Mega Evolutions era and the end of Scarlet and Violet, so snapping up these top Mega cards before prices go even higher is a wise move. We know how it'll play out, no one will be able to grab the new sets at launch, then the nostalgia will kick in and these cards will skyrocket.  Just the Charizards and Rayquazzas alone are worth a look.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Magic: The Gathering Price Comparison</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">MTG doesn't seem to be struggling to keep up with demand despite it being one of the biggest trading card games on earth, but that doesn't stop big box retailers getting cheeky when they notice a peak in demand. Like with Pokémon TCG, i've gone through the majority of MTG stock on Amazon and compared their pricing to market values on TCG Player. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1vxV?object_uuid=2e864453-2d87-404f-b835-32ee2b94096f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Theros Beyond Death booster</a> made me spit out my tea. Amazon is listing a single booster for $378.08, but these can be picked up <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgGme?object_uuid=2e864453-2d87-404f-b835-32ee2b94096f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">any day of the week for $5.59 on TCG Player</a>. Go figure. Another big difference is <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBgnNN?object_uuid=2e864453-2d87-404f-b835-32ee2b94096f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marvel's Spider-Man - Play Booster Box</a>. Amazon has their preorder price guarantee on this, but it's still <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJg6mn?object_uuid=2e864453-2d87-404f-b835-32ee2b94096f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">17% cheaper to preorder on TCG Player</a>. 
</p><p id="climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Climbers">This Weeks MTG Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we covered in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-cards-spike-thanks-to-new-final-fantasy-synergies"><u>our recent synergies feature</u></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7YxR?object_uuid=2e864453-2d87-404f-b835-32ee2b94096f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Harmonic Prodigy</a> gives double Wizard triggers – nice! That means it's gone up by 118.70% in the past month (246.76% in three) – not so nice! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's good for those that own the card, not so good for those who are looking to pick it up standalone. Still, market is still just $12.75 right now, so it could be <em>a lot</em> worse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving away from Vivi, Tifa’s getting some love from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKg47j?object_uuid=2e864453-2d87-404f-b835-32ee2b94096f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bristly Bill, Spine Sower</a>. This Outlaws of Thunder Junction card can help power up our martial artist heroine, but at a cost of almost $40 now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another nifty synergy that's climbing is Perch Protection. This Instant has climbed from a dollar to almost $6, since it handily ties into Chocobo decks.</p><p id="waoaw-sleep-mask-w-3d-eye-cups-ad"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="WAOAW Sleep Mask w/ 3D Eye Cups &amp; Ad">WAOAW Sleep Mask w/ 3D Eye Cups &amp; Adjustable Strap (Black)</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223810"><div id="223810" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>WAOAW Sleep Mask w/ 3D Eye Cups &amp; Adjustable Strap (Black)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re sensitive to light while sleeping, this 3D contoured eye mask from WAOAW might be worth trying.
