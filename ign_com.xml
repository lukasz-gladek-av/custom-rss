As she wanders, it seems she's in some kind of shrine, and ends up following a figure with a blue lamp deeper in. She's then attacked by those freaky dolls we've seen in past trailers, and we see shots of a number of other unsettling rooms in the shrine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer cuts to another scene at an old house on a rainy day, which Hinako seems to recognize as her own. We see her with her clothes torn and bloody, and a creepy woman's voice giving instructions to kill everyone, and then Hinako confronting one of her classmates. All-in-all, not nearly as gory as the last trailer, but still plenty unnerving.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f is set in 1960s Japan, with a story written by Ryukishi07 intended to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-writer-ryukishi07-says-his-story-is-a-salad-dressing-of-supernatural-and-psychological-horror">contrast beauty and horror</a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-revealed-as-a-new-game-set-in-1960s-japan">First announced in 2022</a>, we've since learned that it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-a-completely-new-title-that-people-who-have-never-played-the-series-can-enjoy-konami-says">standalone from the other Silent Hill games</a>, and that it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-the-first-in-konamis-horror-series-to-get-an-18-rating-in-japan">Japan's first M-rated Silent Hill game</a>, and comes with some frankly disgusting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-gets-gruesome-new-details-in-esrb-rating-and-content-warnings">content warnings</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-40-000-dawn-of-war-4-is-finally-a-reality-%E2%80%94-but-its-developer-may-surprise-you.1274769/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 is finally a reality after an announcement at Opening Night Live 2025. We have a debut trailer, snippets of gameplay, a new faction making its series debut, and a surprise developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The much-loved real-time strategy series began life in 2004 with Relic Entertainment’s Dawn of War, and the expectation was that if a fourth game was ever going to be made, it would be Relic who would do it. Indeed, Relic was behind the recently released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition">Dawn of War Definitive Edition</a>, which breathed new life into the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Dawn of War 4 is in development at King Art Games, the studio behind alternate reality 1920s RTS <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/iron-harvest">Iron Harvest</a>, and is published by Deep Silver (Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Dead Island 2), with help from a German video game grant.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s in Dawn of War 4? It’s billed as returning the RTS series to its roots, which is sure to please fans of the first game. Expect “deeply satisfying gameplay” and a “brutal, expanded Sync Kill system.” One of the best things about the Dawn of War games are the Sync Kills, which see cool animations play out when certain units kill an enemy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are four factions at launch: Space Marines; Orks; Necrons; and making their Dawn of War debut, the Adeptus Mechanicus. There are four story campaigns with over 70 missions in total (we’re told there are “spectacular” CGI intros and fully animated cutscenes). You can play the campaign solo or with a friend, with a story penned by Black Library author John French (the Ahriman series).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Blood Ravens chapter of Space Marines returns, as do some of the characters from the previous games, such as Captain Cyrus, Chief Librarian Jonah Orion, and Warboss Gorgutz. The story itself is set “many years” after the events of Dawn of War: Dark Crusade, the second expansion for the first Dawn of War. There’s no mention of Dawn of War 2 or the disastrous Dawn of War 3 in today's announcement. Clearly, the hope here is Dawn of War 4 will lean on the enduring love for the more traditional RTS original.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, there are Last Stand and Skirmish modes with over 30 missions, and the expected multiplayer with over 30 maps. There are over 10 playable Commanders, over 110 units / buildings, many of which are customisable, an in-game editor, and a painter tool for unit customization.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>The series returns to its roots with classic Dawn of War gameplay and a combat system designed to bring Warhammer 40,000’s bloodthirsty combat to life like never before. Grow your force, build your base of operations, specialise your squads, and savour an expanded Sync Kill system that delivers an unprecedented degree of melee combat detail.</blockquote><blockquote>Enjoy an endlessly replayable collection of game modes, including the return of fan-favourite Last Stand! Fight highly-configurable AI battles in Skirmish, or take on the world in 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 multiplayer. Wherever you’re waging war, use the Painter tool to stamp your own unique personality on your fighting forces, as well as the option to use existing factions from the Warhammer 40,000 universe.</blockquote><blockquote>Set many years after the events of Dawn of War: Dark Crusade, war has returned to the planet Kronus, along with Captain Cyrus, Chief Librarian Jonah Orion, and Warboss Gorgutz and several new commanders as four factions fight for supremacy. Kronus features a number of distinct biomes including the Wasteland, Iceland, Highlands, Hive City &amp; Manufactorum regions. </blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War 4 is due out at some point in 2026. Here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Opening Night Live 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has been announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live, featuring an open-world version of Gotham you can drive around in the Batmobile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ambitious-looking project is being developed by TT Games, the studio behind Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga and numerous other licensed Lego games, and is set to launch on Nintendo Switch 2, PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Included in the game are characters and levels that pay reference to various familiar Batman movies and comics, while combat looks similar to the Batman Arkham games. Oh, and Matt Berry is playing Bane.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Whether he’s the wrathful Dark Knight, the brilliant detective, or the unlikely father of the ‘Batfam,’ Batman has constantly evolved — shaped by the world around him while remaining a timeless symbol," said Jim Lee, President, Publisher, and Chief Creative Officer, DC. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This game brings together nearly every facet of his legacy, letting you experience the full range of what makes Batman iconic. Built with incredible care, creativity, and deep respect for the mythos,<strong> </strong>TT Games has crafted a love letter to the world of Batman.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight's story begins with a young Bruce Wayne training a fresh League of Shadows, recruiting allies such as Jim Gordon, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, Catwoman, and Talia al Ghul. The famous names don't stop there, of course, as the team will be facing down enemies such as The Joker, The Penguin, Poison Ivy, Ra's al Ghul, and, as previously mentioned, Bane. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">TT Games once held a near monopoly over licensed Lego video games for PC and consoles, with new titles released on an annual basis. Between 2005 and 2022, the company launched at least 20 Lego games, with multiple entries based on Marvel, DC, Harry Potter and Star Wars franchises. The company dabbled with the toys-to-life genre with its earlier multiverse project Lego Dimensions, and sandbox gameplay in Lego Worlds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, TT Games' new take on Lego Batman arrives during a different era, with a range of Lego games available from other developers, the toy franchise deeply integrated into Fortnite, and a lengthy (for Lego games) wait since 2022's Lego Skywalker: The Skywalker Saga. It'll be fascinating to see more of what the developer has been building.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">I don't know what to do with all these clown noses anymore.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, hello, we're back again with another update on the ongoing saga of "Are we getting a Silksong release date this week?" The answer is, still maybe, but it's not happening at Gamescom Opening Night Live today. Instead, we got almost 30 whole seconds of brand new gameplay, and a reassurance that it is, in fact, coming out this year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If I sound a little over it, it's because I, like many of you, put on my clown makeup yesterday at the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oh-boy-geoff-keighley-is-teasing-hollow-knight-silksong-for-gamescom-opening-night-live">behest of ONL host Geoff Keighley</a>, when he teased something Silksong related at his show today. There was no guarantee of what it was going to be, if anything. But there's a whole heap of evidence pointing toward the release date being soon, like in the next few months, and given that we still don't know it, ONL would have been perfect for an announcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, today, hours before the show, developer Team Cherry <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-developer-teases-special-announcement-later-this-week">teased a "special announcement"</a> for Silksong this Thursday, while Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier took to social media to affirm no release date for Silksong would be revealed at Opening Night Live. Okay, fine. And <em>then, </em>during the pre-show, this happened:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/19/gamescom-onl-2025-official-livestream-call-of-duty-resident-evil-fallout-live-now-44-17-screenshot-1755627199032.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">So, okay, no Silksong at all during ONL? Fine, sure. But then, there it was! For 30 whole seconds, and a confirmation from Keighley that it would be out later this year and on the Gamescom show floor, both of which we already knew.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The community, of course, has been completely normal about all this, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake">as usual</a>, with the subreddit and "silksong" tags on various other social platforms absolutely exploding throughout. It looks like everyone's coming out of this happy: they got new footage today, and a likely release date coming on Thursday, though at this point I'm hesitant to posit even that much given the back-and-forth nature of this whole situation. It's become such a meme at this point that it's almost impossible to tell what's going on with this game anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, the footage itself is kind of cool, if a bit thin on actually revealing meaty new information. We see what looks like a new boss in there, and some of Hornet using some cool abilities on various enemies. I'm sure in the coming hours the community will fully dissect and compare this with older footage (the last new stuff we saw was back in 2023) to see what all we can glean from it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopefully Thursday is finally a release date so we can end this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-the-story-behind-the-insanely-long-wait-clown-meme">weird, six-year anticipation</a> once and for all and just get on with playing the dang thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced">Gamescom Opening Night Live right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

In a recent interview with IGN, we put both of those suggestions to Black Ops 7 co-developer Treyarch to get its response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio’s words follow a series of claims from industry peers that the annualised shooter series is in need of some healthy competition. At this year’s Summer Game Fest, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">Splitgate 2 director Ian Proulx stated that he was “tired of playing the same Call of Duty every year."</a> That sentiment is seemingly shared by former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra, who posted last week in relation to the latest Battlefield 6 open beta:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year. But the real win here is CoD won’t be lazy anymore, and we’ll all get better FPS games for it.</p>— Mike Ybarra 😇 (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1953621587993014620?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN ahead of Black Ops 7's Opening Night Live 2025 reveal, associate creative director Miles Leslie said Treyarch tries to shut out the noise and focus on delivering the best game possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You just don't worry about it, right?” Leslie said when asked about the "lazy" claims. “When we start, it’s not like ‘what are they going to think?’ It’s like, we have a vision, we’re going to hit that vision, and there’s always going to be people that are going to try to knock you down and not have positive criticism, which we do look for. So, it’s like noise, right? You try to cut through that and stick to your vision and plan.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And from what I’ve seen, it really would be unfair to call this year’s Call of Duty lazy. You can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-isnt-lazy-its-the-series-biggest-swing-in-years"><u>read all about it in my full Black Ops 7 preview here</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the threat of Battlefield 6, we asked Leslie if DICE's game pushes Treyarch on or even if the developer thinks about the game at all. Leslie said he'd played DICE's game but is focused squarely on Black Ops 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I got to play this weekend," he said. "It's a fun game. We're fans of all games and I think we look for inspiration anywhere. But we're focused on our own craft. They're doing their thing. We know if we can hit our goals, we're going to deliver what the fans want and that's the key, because if we're happy when we're play testing, then we know fans are going to be happy play testing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're fans of the FPS genre. We're fans of lots of games. Let's all have fun."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was revealed at gamescom Opening Night Live 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

I've had the pleasure of working on Call of Duty now for almost 20 years, and we're constantly looking at ways to push into different audiences and fans, and that's what you saw with that; there are fans that really love it. Obviously, there are fans who those may not be their favorite. We're going to try to calibrate that as we move forward, and we take that feedback seriously. But again, we are trying to make sure that all fans feel represented in the game and figuring out that tight balance is something we're paying attention to.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It comes as Battlefield 6 — a far more self-serious depiction of warfare — emerges as a genuine contender to Call of Duty’s online shooter dominance. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-call-of-dutys-obsession-with-goofy-skins-firmly-entrenched-battlefield-6-dev-commits-to-gritty-realism-i-dont-think-it-needs-nicki-minaj"><u>Don’t expect to see similar outrageous outfits making their way into EA’s military sim</u></a>, though, with design director Shashank Uchil stating, “I don’t think it needs Nicki Minaj.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlestar-galactica-scattered-hopes-aims-to-deliver-an-ftl-like-roguelike.1274739/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlestar Galactica has become one of the lost classics in the modern sci-fi canon. We live in an era of constant reinterpolation—new Star Wars serials churn from Disney every quarter, and Star Trek is consistently made flush with new content—but if you weren't watching television in the mid-2000s, there's a good chance you completely missed this heady tale of survival and humanity that once dominated the discourse. And in that sense, Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes is the first breath of new life into the franchise in more than a decade. The game doesn't attempt to be the long-awaited expansion of the continuity, but from what I've played so far, it does make a valiant effort to replicate why people fell in love with this universe in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scattered Hopes is, basically, a turn-based roguelike, set in a galaxy that is especially apt for the genre. If you're unfamiliar with Battlestar Galactica, the story follows the last remnants of humanity that have had their galaxy-spanning empire wiped out by a superpowered fleet of sentient robots known as the Cylons. With no home to return to, the survivors hurtle through space in a massive warship—the Galactica in question—in permanent transit, hoping to someday come across the fabled homeworld of Earth. Scattered Hopes essentially shrinks down this premise. Instead of trying to find a new Eden, you're piloting a couple of junkers that are attempting to track down the Galactica and join the convoy. As such, you'll spend much of your time in space shoring up all sorts of different logistical crises. Do we have enough fuel? Enough supplies? Is morale too low? Do our fighter ships need repairs? All those questions must be addressed before the Cylons appear on the horizon, launching an attack on your ragtag armada, which must be fended off while charging up a faster-than-light drive, in order to jump to the next sector.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The action brings to mind FTL, perhaps the greatest of all space-faring roguelikes. Scattered Hopes oscillates between white-knuckle tension when the Cylons demonstrate their incredible force, but much of your time in this game will be oddly dulcet. Tech trees will be dutifully filled out with upgrades, providing more fighters, better medbays, and tougher hull exteriors. Lonely travellers cross our paths, and join forces. Staff level up, and develop new traits. This is all rendered in a beautiful semi-retro pixelated style. The ships look great, but I'm especially taken by the dank, gritty interiors—the slate-grey hanger bay, the tech lab glowing with computer screens. Battlestar Galactica might be a dystopia, but it has also always been a spaceship I wanted to explore. Scattered Hopes captures that in spades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even more importantly, Scattered Hopes does its best to inject some legitimate narrative tension into what is, ultimately, a procedurally generated adventure. For instance: At one point you may be alerted by a lieutenant that the air filtration systems on your ship are on the fritz. Once it's repaired, you have the choice of either reprimanding the workers who installed those faulty mechanisms, or blame the underworld traders for providing bad materials. Your choice will alter your personal reputation with either of those factions—there are gameplay consequences at play—but they also add a splash of color to the run. An apt comparison might be Frostpunk, another game that melds horrific humanitarian catastrophes with nuts-and-bolts optimization.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When the Cylons come, as they always do, Scattered Hopes pivots from being a turn-based management sim into a straight-up real-time strategy game. The onslaught almost mirrors a tower defense set-up. You'll be fielding a small handful of fighters—ideally piloted by a curated selection of aces—who must fend off the assault for a specific amount of time. The Cylons all tend to make a beeline for the heart of the armada, laying waste to your few civilian ships. So, expert captains will put their fighters in position to create something of a chokepoint, letting them mow down the Cylons upon entry. (One of the few advantages we're given as players is knowledge of where the enemies are going to spawn from.) </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When the Cylons come, as they always do, Scattered Hopes pivots from being a turn-based management sim into a straight-up real-time strategy game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However, what the Cylons lack in brains they more than make up for in scale, and the deeper you get into a run, you'll start facing down some insurmountable odds. That's when the flagships come in. They're outfitted with both tactical heat-seeking missiles and board-clearing nukes that glitter in the void and vaporize everything within the blast radius. The action can get pretty technical, and extremely overwhelming. Engagements can be won or lost if players are a split-second late on an important maneuvering decision. When things get out of hand, Cylons can absolutely melt the health bars of your most important assets. Thankfully, Scattered Hopes does offer a real-time combat pause, letting you mete out orders deliberately, without being constantly under fire. To play the game correctly, you'll likely be tapping that space bar every other second.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of combat you'll quickly scurry the fighters back to their docking ports and blast off to the next zone, with a collection of fresh bullet holes left in your hull. More crises will pop up, more repairs will need to be completed, and when the Cylons return, they will almost certainly be more dangerous than before. The thing my time with Scattered Hopes seemed most eager to hammer home is that this is a difficult video game—beholden to plenty of good RNG, as roguelikes always are, but also your own management chops. Battlestar Galactica, after all, is a franchise all about doing just enough to stay alive for another day. Scattered Hopes is eager to honor that legacy. I'm hoping it can pull it off.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlestar-galactica-scattered-hopes-aims-to-deliver-an-ftl-like-roguelike]]></content:encoded>

It's a single-player, first-person soulslike taking place in an alt-history Eastern Europe during a fictionalized version of Napoleon's invasion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Valor Mortis, you play as William, a French soldier who died in battle, and who has mysteriously come back with the power to control a corrupting, plague-like substance called the Nephtoglobin. The Nephtoglobin has corrupted his former comrades-in-arms, but William can use it to fight against Napoleon and his army to reclaim his home.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Valor Mortis looks plenty gory and gruesome, with all sorts of body horror going on as enemies turn into increasingly messed up zombie things from the effects of the Nephtoglobin. In turn, finding more of that substance appears to enhance your own abilities, letting you do things like shoot fire out of your hands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valor Mortis is planned for a 2026 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series consoles.

He's back, with a new 3D game developed by indie studio Fabraz and published by Atari. It's called Bubsy 4D, and it's Bubsy's first 3D adventure since 1996's (notoriously not very good) Bubsy 3D.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bubsy 4D brings back the alien Woolies, who have returned to Earth to steal its sheep and empower them with Woolie tech. But then, the sheep revolt, creating the BaaBots, who fight back and regain control of The Golden Fleece. Bubsy, in turn, must get the fleece back from the BaaBots, who have taken over planets formerly belonging to the Woolies. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Bubsy, many familiar faces from his past games are making a return: Terri, Terry, Virgil, and Oblivia. Bubsy 4D will feature a lot that's familiar: 3D movement, platforming, and collectibles. There are also online time trials, and a new hairball form for Bubsy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, Bubsy 3D didn't exactly go over amazingly. The game initially launched to critical reviews of its controls and camera, and it's only become further panned ever since, even earning spots on some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/15/30-worst-video-games-of-all-time-part-one" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worst games of all time</a> lists. Notably, though, it seems that the studio behind it is aware of its reputation and is being at least a bit cheeky about it:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's been a wild ride to work on a sequel to Bubsy 3D, considering its infamous legacy." said Fabian Rastorfer at Fabraz in a press release. "It was really important for us to take this challenge seriously by both identifying what's made the bobcat stick around for so long, while also reinventing parts of the series to work better. I believe Bubsy's move-set is stronger than ever and anyone who's played our previous games will feel right at home with this expressive 3D platformer. I'm incredibly proud of the world we've created and I can't WAIT to see everyone's reactions to this announcement. Surprise!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bubsy 4D is coming to PlayStation 5 and 4, Xbox Series and One, Nintendo Switch 1 and 2, and PC at a later date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
