            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Bethesda developer Bruce Nesmith has offered his thoughts on the divisive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a>, insisting if it has been released by any other studio “it would have been received differently.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/starfield-designer-says-sci-fi-rpg-still-a-great-game-but-procedural-generation-stopped-fallout-elder-scrolls/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FRVR</a>, the former Starfield systems designer admitted that the sci-fi RPG is “not in the same calibre” as Bethesda’s much-loved The Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises, but insisted it was still “a great game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it’s a good game,” Nesmith, who left Bethesda around a year before Starfield came out, said. “I don’t think it’s in the same calibre as the other two, you know, Fallout or Skyrim, or Elder Scrolls rather, but I think it’s a good game. I worked on it, I’m proud of the work I did. I’m proud of the work that the people I knew did on it. I think they made a great game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When “the studio that gave you Skyrim and Fallout makes a space game,” Nesmith said, there are certain “expectations,” and these weren’t met. “If the same game had been released by not Bethesda, it would have been received differently,” Nesmith insisted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new IP in 25 years, but it was not as well received as the studio’s previous games in the Fallout and The Elder Scrolls franchises, and the Shattered Space expansion, released a year later in September 2024, has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield went on to reach 15 million players, but the question of whether Bethesda might walk away from the game to focus on its other franchises has been a running theme since release. In June 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2"><u>Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supporting Starfield</u></a>, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would come out following Shattered Space. And in an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That, obviously, hasn't happened. In August, it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-reportedly-set-for-ps5-release-during-spring-2026-alongside-new-expansion"><u>Starfield's second expansion and much-anticipated PlayStation 5 port would now arrive in 2026</u></a>, following the poor reception to Shattered Space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what went wrong? Nesmith pointed to Starfield’s reliance on procedural generation as a problem, as opposed to the lack of real-time space travel, which he described as “inherently boring.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But when the planets start to feel very samey and you don’t start to feel the excitement on the planets, that’s to me where it falls apart,” he continued. “I was also disappointed when, pretty much, the only serious enemy you fought were people… there’s lots of cool alien creatures, but they’re like the wolves in Skyrim. They’re just there, they don’t contribute, you don’t have the variety of serious opponents that are story generators.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/following-datamine-leak-bethesda-confirms-starfield-space-gameplay-revamp-to-make-the-travels-there-more-rewarding"><u>Bethesda has confirmed plans to improve Starfield space gameplay “to make the travels there more rewarding”</u></a> after datamined fragments of code suggested the developer had a more streamlined space travel experience in the works. Based on this datamine, while you may be able to travel between planets within the same system, you won’t be able to fly all the way between systems, nor fly directly from a planet's surface into orbit, like No Man's Sky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new video discussing his career, veteran Bethesda developer Tim Lamb confirmed that the studio had been working on Starfield’s space gameplay, and that a new DLC story was still coming at some point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think as it comes to Starfield, I'm really excited for players to see what the teams have been working on,” he said. “We have some cool stuff coming, including free updates and features the players have been asking for, as well as a new DLC story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I can't go into all the details just yet, but I will say part of the team has been focused on space gameplay to make the travels there more rewarding. We're also adding some new game systems, and a few other smaller delights. There's also some really interesting stuff coming down the pipe from our verified creators. There's some fun stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I just want to say thanks. We really appreciate the support and the enthusiasm. We can't wait to get it into the hands of our players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-teases-terran-armada-on-starfield-2-year-anniversary-sending-fans-down-a-speculation-rabbit-hole">Bethesda teased new content for <u>Starfield</u></a> — at least that’s what fans thought after they spotted a hidden message in a social media video released to celebrate the game’s two-year anniversary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A post on the official Japanese Twitter / X account for the upcoming game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dissidia-duellum-final-fantasy">Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy</a> received a reply from none other than veteran developer Akitoshi Kawazu, who surprised users by revealing new information about the inspiration behind a Final Fantasy II character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy is Square Enix’s upcoming free-to-play mobile game, slated for a 2026 release. Featuring cel-shaded graphics, Dissidia Duellum takes beloved Final Fantasy characters from throughout the RPG series’ history and transports them to modern Tokyo, where they take on monsters in 3vs3 battles. Two teams of Final Fantasy characters will race to fight their way through roaming monsters to beat the boss faster than the opposing team. The game will also feature voiced story segments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dissidia Duellum will not only let you put protagonists like Cloud, Squall, and Lightning in your party, but a whole host of other characters are also making a return, some in the form of special abilities. The official X account recently revealed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/final-fantasy-ii/Minwu">Minwu</a>, a character from 1988’s Final Fantasy II, will be lending power to your party with his teleport ability.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">ミン=ウは漢字で表記すると、呉明、となります。モデルは戦国時代の呉起。孫呉の兵法という形で孫氏と並び立つ兵法家という評価です。</p>— 河津秋敏 (@SaGa30kawazu) <a href="https://twitter.com/SaGa30kawazu/status/1979894991829999619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Veteran dev Akitoshi Kawazu, battle designer for Final Fantasy I and II as well as the key creator of the SaGa series, responded to this post with some insight into Minwu’s original inspiration. In his post, Kawazu revealed that Minwu was modelled on Wu Qi, a real life military general and philosopher from China's Warring States period. He explained that when Minwu’s name is written in kanji characters, it contains the same character for Wu as Wu Qi (rendered as 呉 in Japanese, and 吳 in traditional Chinese). For the Japanese release of Final Fantasy II, Minwu’s name was written phonetically in katakana (a script used for foreign loan words) just like the rest of the game’s cast of characters, so the reference to Wu Qi was not apparent to players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Final Fantasy II, Minwu is a white wizard from Mysidia who temporarily joins your party. He serves the Flynn royal family in exile as an advisor when the Palemecian Empire’s attack forces them to flee. He plays a key role in organizing rebel forces and the quest for the Ultima Tome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another reason Minwu’s inspiration is not readily apparent is his physical appearance. With his turban and dark skin, he does not visually resemble Wu Qi. However, his strategic role as an advisor plus his loyalty to the Flynn royal family and Princess Hilda does bear some resemblance to Wu Qi’s appointment as the head of Chu State and his fealty to King Dao. Sadly, both meet tragic ends.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Final Fantasy Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kawazu’s comment attracted many appreciative responses from other users. “It makes me extremely happy to receive new information about FFII in this day and age. Thank you,” said one<a href="https://x.com/kandata_dq10/status/1979940177658384569" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> commenter</u></a>. <a href="https://x.com/ZERU_KOBA/status/1980287303567512044" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Others</u></a> were eager for more insight into the 37-year-old game: “I wonder if there are any behind-the-scenes revelations or inspirations for other Final Fantasy II characters?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dissidia Duellum is scheduled to launch on iOS and Android in 2026. Those in Canada and the U.S. can sign up for the <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_EU/news/dissidia-duellum-final-fantasy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>closed beta in November</u></a> to get a sneak peak at the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.
