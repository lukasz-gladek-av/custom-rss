There are three standard models available: the original Xbox One, a slimmer redesign called Xbox One S, and the more powerful Xbox One X.

Often times, you can scoop up the console at a discount, or purchase limited-time bundles that include additional games, Xbox Game Pass trials, accessories, or in-game content.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Trade in Your Old Xbox</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to trade in your old Xbox consoles, you can do so at select retailers in-store and online. Often, the most widely available retailers are <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/trade/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameStop</a> and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/services/best-buy-trade-in/pcmcat133600050011.c?id=pcmcat133600050011" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Buy</a>. However, you can also trade your used devices online at retailers such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/l/9187220011" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/microsoft-trade-in" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some retailers will offer you cash for your used goods, while others may provide you with a gift card that can be used in-store and online. This is a great way to offload your old gaming gear and get some money that you can put towards a newer console and games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While trading devices in at retailers will often net you the lowest amount for your used consoles, there are also online marketplaces such as eBay, Craigslist, and OfferUp that may fetch higher prices, but you'll often be responsible for packing and shipping costs, or be required to meet someone in person for the transaction, the latter of which poses its own risks.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Trade in Xbox Games</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to Xbox console trade ins, you can also trade your existing games in at specific retailers. The most widely available retailer accepting used video games is <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/trade/?cgid=video-games&amp;tileView=list" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameStop</a>, but they are notorious for giving you pennies on the dollar for your pre-owned titles. However, if you're looking for an easy way to offload some of your library for cash or in-store credit, this is a convenient option. You can always look up the expected trade-in value on GameStop's website before heading into a store, so you know exactly how much you'll receive. Additionally, you can trade in your used games online through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/l/9187220011" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> in exchange for an Amazon gift card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matthew Adler is a Commerce, Features, Guides, News, Previews, and Reviews writer for IGN.
