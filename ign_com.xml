That's according to a Steam page description of the game briefly seen before it was pulled (but not before the leak was spotted and shared on <a href="https://x.com/Wario64" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Tokon's roster is described as "expanding" — so it sounds like we should expect further heroes from the Marvel universe to turn up in future. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Online, there's mention of 64-player online lobbies, including standard VS modes. PC players will require a PlayStation account, meanwhile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Guilty Gear Strive maker Arc System Works, the game has currently been announced for PlayStation 5 and PC with a vague "2026" launch window. But the timing of this week's leak, just days ahead of Sony's hour-long State of Play showcase, suggests we may hear more on all of that pretty soon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, only eight characters have been officially confirmed for the game: Captain America (Steve Rogers), Doctor Doom, Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes), Iron Man, Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan), Spider-Man (Peter Parker), Star-Lord and Storm. We'd bet this number will grow in the next few days...</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">"Assemble your team of legendary Marvel characters in the ultimate 4v4 tag team fighter from PlayStation Studios, Arc System Works and Marvel Games," the game's leaked description read. "It's time to build your dream team and break some spirits in blistering 4v4 fighting action. Choose from an expanding roster of 20 iconic Marvel characters at launch, each rendered in a bold new anime-inspired art style and members of their own unique teams of equally impressive heroes and villains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Experiment with team compositions to discover new combos, synergies, and strategies. Blast your way through dynamic stages based on iconic Marvel Universe locales, some featuring interactive stage transitions. Fighting is both immersive and intuitive, with a range of unique move sets, combos, and strategies to master. Adjustable controls, both traditional and quick inputs, plus easy chain combos make diving right in a breeze.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Face off against a friend locally or join the fray with up to 64 players in the online* lobby, including standard VS modes. Plus, dive deep on each team with the single player Episode Mode to learn more about team dynamics and lore. Internet connection and account for PlayStation required."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is set to hold its State of Play this Thursday, February 12 at 2pm Pacific / 5pm Eastern / 10pm UK time — and as ever, IGN will be reporting live.<br>

We’ll share some of our plans soon," Cannon added. "Our plans for the 2026 Competitive Series are unchanged. We remain committed to partnering with tournament organizers and local communities. Our focus will continue to be on supporting the events and organizers that already power the [fighting game community]."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cannon stressed that the team that built 2XKO "poured years of creativity, care, and belief into this game. Taking creative risks like this is hard, and the work they did is real and meaningful."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’re committed to supporting impacted Rioters through this transition — including helping them explore opportunities within Riot where possible, and providing a minimum of 6 months of notice pay and severance where it’s not," he explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cannon closed on promising more information would come in time, and thanked players for playing 2XKO and "caring enough to ask hard questions."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Riot has also confirmed to IGN that the cuts will affect approximately 80 roles globally, representing less than half of the total team.

Those appearances set a "precedent" for Anran, Fareeha said, leaving her to now "mourn" the final in-game design made available to play in early access at the weekend. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There was an unspoken promise that said 'we're going to challenge the beauty standards that are plaguing and ransacking media these days'," Fareeha stated. "The Ozempic chic, the 'contour your nose,' 'you have no nose,' 'the tiniest nose.' And I think because of that precedent, people feel understandably let down."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> game director Aaron Keller has released his own statement, and said that Blizzard hoped to make changes to Anran's in-game design to make her "look and feel more like the fierce older sister" she was originally shown to be. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without showing a new look for the character or providing any further specifics, Keller suggested Blizzard was working actively on the change, which would be seen by players later in the game's new Season 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Thank you all for the incredible reception to last week's Spotlight event," Keller said in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/2021058375337791653?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> posted to game's official social media account. "We're sorting through all the questions, comments, excitement and feedback that you guys shared, and I wanted to take a moment to address one thing in particular. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The team is currently discussing what it will take to make Anran look and feel more like the fierce older sister that we all envision her to be. We're so proud of the work that our team has put into Anran and the rest of the five heroes launching in Season 1, and we agree that she can be even better if we get this aspect of her right in-game. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Overwatch Spotlight reception and an Anran update from Game Director Aaron Keller <a href="https://t.co/mxh0C0IpIj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/mxh0C0IpIj</a></p>— Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/2021058375337791653?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 10, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"We discussed sharing this with all of you last week but wanted to wait until we had confirmation of exactly what we can do. We're hoping to make this update in Season 1 but I don't have specifics to share just yet. Our hero models are incredibly complicated and we really need to test out what we can do. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're always striving to make Overwatch better and I think Season 1 is a great example of the dedication and tireless work that our team puts into this game, its universe and ultimately, our players. We're so excited to share it with all of you when Season 1 launches tomorrow. Thanks for the feedback and support, we couldn't do it without all of you. Please keep it coming."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatchs-promise-of-a-new-era-tempts-back-thousands-of-players-giving-the-sequel-its-biggest-month-since-launch">Thousands of players flocked back to <u>Overwatch</u> over the weekend</a> following the announcement that the game was dropping its "2" and adding 10 new heroes in future.
