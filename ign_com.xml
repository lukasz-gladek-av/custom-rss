            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Open world is now almost a cliché statement."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The lead designer of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim"><u>Skyrim</u></a> is "eternally shocked" at not just the RPG's success, but its enduring appeal, suggesting it's the game's open world and "quirkiness" that keeps players coming back 14 years after its debut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skyrim released way back in 2011. An open-world RPG, it puts players on the precipice of determining the future of Skyrim as the Empire waits for the prophesied Dragonborn to come, a hero born with the power of The Voice, and the only one who can stand among the dragons. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-review"><u>IGN's Skyrim review returned a 9.5/10.</u></a> We called it "a rare kind of intensely personal, deeply rewarding experience, and one of the best role-playing games yet produced."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, speaking on the <a href="https://linktr.ee/frvrpodcast" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>FRVR Podcast</u></a>, lead designer Bruce Nesmith offered his thoughts on why so many people continue to play and enjoy Skyrim so many years later. "I think Skyrim did the open world in a way that nobody had ever done before and very few people have really tried to do since," he said, adding: "By all rights, a year later, some other game should have eclipsed it. And then two years later, three years later, five, 10. It’s like ‘what the hell is going on here?’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Todd [Howard, Bethesda boss] would even go to these meetings and show us information, which I can’t give you the details of, about how many people are playing it. It’s like, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me?’ Seriously, still, 10 years later."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploring the game's legacy and lasting community, he added: "I think Skyrim did the open world in a way that nobody had ever done before and very few people have really tried to do since. And one of those things that we accepted, which a lot of developers struggle to accept, is that this means you’re going to have quirkiness. You’re going to have weird stuff happen. And if you say that’s okay, you can get this diamond."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly then, Nesmith believes that if a developer tries to "smooth everything out" to prevent that aforementioned "weird stuff," "you’re going to lose some of that magic" that makes some games so special.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And we didn’t make that as a conscious decision," he added. "It just sort of happened. You know, we kind of prioritize functionally and 'well, okay, that bug’s acceptable. This behaviour is less than ideal, but we can live with it because look what we’re getting over here.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We didn’t put anything off limits. We didn’t try to manage the experience. We let it be <em>your</em> experience, it was a player-driven experience. And very, very few games have mastered that because open world is now almost a cliché statement... ‘Oh yeah, we have open world.’"</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Elder Scrolls Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda is of course working on its hotly anticipated Skyrim follow-up, The Elder Scrolls 6.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield boss Vince Zampella has said that Activision's best-selling <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty</a> franchise only exists "because EA were dicks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an eye-opening but typically frank statement from Zampella, who is of course now an EA employee himself once again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over his career, Zampella has ping-ponged between rival publishers EA and Activision, working first on EA's Medal of Honor series, then founding Infinity Ward and helping create Call of Duty — specifically so it could be Activision's Medal of Honor "killer" — before returning back to EA after helping create Titanfall and Apex Legends at Respawn.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The only reason that Call of Duty exists is because EA were dicks," Zampella told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/battlefield-6-vince-zampella" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, reflecting on his career. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zampella initially worked on EA's Medal of Honor franchise from 1999 to 2002, and served as lead designer on the celebrated Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. After this, Zampella co-founded his own studio, Infinity Ward, with initial plans to continue working on Medal of Honor left up in the air when EA decided to take development of its franchise in-house. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For legal reasons I will say things didn't go as planned with it," former Infinity Ward artist Justin Thomas previously revealed of the situation in an <a href="https://mcvuk.com/business-news/publishing/the-medal-of-honor-killer-a-call-of-duty-story/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MCV</a> interview, back in 2013. "We were left in a situation of unpaid milestones that were delivered and no finances to operate on."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was at this point that Activision answered a last-ditch call by Infinity Ward, intrigued by the potential of working with the team behind Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, and driven by the idea of creating a new franchise that could topple EA's own. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6: Single-Player Campaign Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest, as they say, is history. Call of Duty became a behemoth, though Activision and Zampella parted ways following the launch of 2009's Modern Warfare 2, prompting a bitter legal feud over unpaid bonuses and royalties that dragged on for years (until Zampella ultimately earned a sizable payout). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That situation then led to Zampella co-founding Titanfall and Apex Legends developer Respawn, which EA partnered with then ultimately acquired. Zampella was then repeatedly promoted to look after more of EA's gaming portfolio, ultimately becoming boss of the embattled Battlefield franchise, turning its fortunes around to deliver this month's successful release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GQ's interview also includes a snippet on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/08/10/call-of-duty-elite-enlists-hollywood-talent">now-distant plans for Alien director Ridley Scott to direct a Call of Duty movie</a>, something which ultimately never came to pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ridley Scott came in one time – who's a hero of mine – but he's not connected to games, so he'd ask these questions like, ‘How do you script what happens?’" Zampella recalled. "There was a bit of a talk around him doing a Call of Duty film, but we never really took it seriously. Video game movies at that point were never really that good."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched last week and earned EA its best-ever game launch on Steam, beating that of Apex Legends.
