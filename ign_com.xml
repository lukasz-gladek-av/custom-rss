            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-games-under-10-steam-winter-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the holiday season, which means festive activities, family time, and, most importantly, the Steam Winter Sale. With discounts on everything from massive open world RPGs to pixel-art platformers, it can be tough to limit yourself to just a few games. While I'm all for splurging on 2024 releases, if you're looking to maximize bang for your buck, you could also pick up a solid bunch of slightly older (but still amazing) PC games. For example, right now you can get over 10 copies of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22380/Fallout_New_Vegas/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fallout: New Vegas</a> for the price of one <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A starting point for Steam sales should always be checking your Wishlist, but if you're looking for something new (or want to make sure you're not missing an obvious deal), I found 33 of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-games">best PC games</a> for $10 or less. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Complete Edition of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt for $10</strong></h2><div catalogid="0d0168fb-49ee-4fb7-81a7-b2b2faa2eb5f" id="213711"><div id="213711" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Witcher 3's massive open world, compelling characters, and meaningful approach to player decision-making raised the bar for RPGs back in 2015. After <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-revealed-with-debut-trailer-cd-projekt-confirms-single-player-open-world-action-rpg-the-game-awards-2024">The Witcher 4 was revealed at The Game Awards</a>, what better time to play (or replay) one of the greatest RPGs of all time? Especially now that the Complete Edition, which includes the base game and every DLC, is down to just $9.99.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More RPGs Under $10: </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for a narrative-driven RPG, I highly recommend Disco Elysium, which is also down to $10. Other RPGs with deep discounts include Bethesda properties like Fallout 4, Fallout: New Vegas, and (of course) Skyrim. Meanwhile, Baldur's Gate 3 fans who have a hankering for more turn-based combat can pick up one of Larian's older games, Divinity: Original Sin, for just $3.99. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">40% Off Stardew Valley</h2></div><div catalogid="0d0168fb-49ee-4fb7-81a7-b2b2faa2eb5f" id="213724"><div id="213724" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Stardew Valley</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Leave your office job to inherit your grandfather's farm and help rebuild (or price out) the local town in Stardew Valley. IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-review-2024">re-reviewed Stardew Valley</a> after the farming game got a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Stardew_Valley_1.6_Update">massive update</a> and ended up giving it one of the only 10/10 game reviews for all of 2024. Given that Stardew was somehow my most-played game on Steam and Nintendo Switch, I have to agree that "Masterpiece" is a fair assessment.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>More Cozy Games Under $10:</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Cozy Grove, which I feel is more like Animal Crossing than Stardew, is on sale for under $5. If you're the type of person who enjoys organizing, I'd recommend Unpacking, while Spiritfarer brings the management game genre to the afterlife. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>DOOM Eternal for $10</strong></h2></div><div catalogid="0d0168fb-49ee-4fb7-81a7-b2b2faa2eb5f" id="213719"><div id="213719" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DOOM Eternal</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The DOOM series was pretty foundational to the FPS genre, and one of the best DOOM games of the modern era has dropped to under $10. In IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-eternal-final-review">9/10 DOOM Eternal review</a>, Ryan McCaffrey highlights the game's satisfying difficulty: "This excellent refinement of the already outstanding 2016 reboot makes you an unspoken deal: if you can keep up with it, it will keep up with you."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More FPS Games Under $10: </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">For more single-player shooting, you can get six Halo games for $10 with The Master Chief Collection. Multiplayer shooters like Siege and Battlefield 2042 are also under $10 for the time being. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">50% Off Hollow Knight </h2></div><div catalogid="0d0168fb-49ee-4fb7-81a7-b2b2faa2eb5f" id="213729"><div id="213729" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hollow Knight</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight is one of the most rewarding gaming experiences I've had, and also the closest I've come to throwing my Switch at the wall in frustration (that's a positive, by the way). Per IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/22/hollow-knight-review">9/10 review</a>: "The world of Hallownest is compelling and rich, full of story that’s left for you to discover on your own, and built with branching paths that offer an absurd amount of choice in how you go about discovering it." Now you can find out why there's always a chorus of comments begging for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gameplay-trailer-news">Silksong</a> release date for just $8. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Platformers Under $10: </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Hollow Knight, Celeste doesn't shy away from challenging the player, and additional "B-sides" for every level up the ante for even platforming veterans. I recommend Little Nightmares to any horror fan, while the 2020 Ori sequel offers particularly creative puzzles. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Civilization VI for $2.99</h2></div><div catalogid="0d0168fb-49ee-4fb7-81a7-b2b2faa2eb5f" id="213739"><div id="213739" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sid Meier’s Civilization VI</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sid-meiers-civilization-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Civ VII</a> set to release in just a couple of months, most of the Sid Meier franchise is on sale. While I prefer Civ V's map mechanics, Civ VI, in my experience, is better optimized for setting up multiplayer lobbies. Convince your friends to drop a couple of bucks, and you can all lock into an empire-building marathon that will most likely end in some form of betrayal. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>More Strategy and Simulation Games Under $10: </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Most Total War games and DLCs are discounted, though one of the best deals is the Warhammer base game for $6. And if you've ever wanted to travel across the entirety of Europe for $5, now you can (with Euro Truck Simulator 2). </p><h2 data-cy="title2">75% Off Overcooked 2</h2></div><div catalogid="0d0168fb-49ee-4fb7-81a7-b2b2faa2eb5f" id="213745"><div id="213745" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Overcooked 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for something cheap you can convince your friends to pick up and play with you, look no further than Overcooked 2. The cooperative cooking game allows up to four players to hop into a campaign that, with arcade-style levels and goofy physics, will probably lead to some screaming. But, as IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/08/07/overcooked-2-review">Overcooked 2 review</a> describes, this "frantic and inventive co-op game... manages to turn frustration into charm."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Co-op Games Under $10: </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">For larger groups, I also recommend For the King and Castle Crashers. It Takes Two is one of the best games for two-player co-op, and only one person has to buy the game courtesy of Hazelight Studio's "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2995920/It_Takes_Two_Friends_Pass/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Friend's Pass</a>." And, of course, Portal 2, down to just $2, will always be a co-op classic. </p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 23, 2024 10:37 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
