            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As fans continue to wait for a final release date, Nintendo has reaffirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is still on track for 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a long and bumpy development that has stretched much of the past decade, fans are eager to hear when the highly-anticipated Switch and Switch 2 exclusive will arrive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But as the months roll on and gossip spreads of the game needing more time than initially expected, Nintendo has now re-stated that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will still launch before the end of the calendar year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, in a news <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/fan-expo-canada-attendees-will-have-access-to-play-the-latest-and-upcoming-titles-on-nintendo-switch-2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> advertising the company's upcoming preseence at Fan Expo Canada, Nintendo has stated that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be playable there ahead of it becoming "available later in 2025."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear if this hands-on opportunity is a new demo, or the one made available to members of the public who attended the Switch 2's pre-launch tour. Still, it's a positive sign the game and its launch are in Nintendo's sights — and still coming at some point within the next five months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement comes amid online discussion surrounding the fact that Nintendo has not released new details on the game or fresh footage of it for a little while. The last new Metroid Prime 4: Beyond trailer uploaded to the Nintendo of America YouTube account comes from the company's Nintendo Switch 2 full console reveal back in March. Since then, the biggest news about the game's launch has been the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/confused-nintendo-fans-spot-giant-metroid-prime-4-beyond-advert-stating-that-the-game-is-out-now-sparking-hopes-of-an-imminent-release">advertising slip-up that saw the game promoted as being "Out Now" in a billboard on the London Underground</a>. If only!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 - Metroid Prime 4 Beyond</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, Nintendo leaker <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mfxizw/kiwitalkz_gives_one_last_update_on_what_he_knows/?share_id=riXz3o7YuwdEAKqEAIBlG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KiwiTalkz</a> had prompted concern among fans that the game was originally due sooner, closer to the Switch 2's launch, but has been held up due to last-minute snags. This, just days after Nintendo's recent third-party focused Partner Direct (where Metroid Prime 4 would not have featured anyway) has contributed to a sense of unease among fans over the game's arrival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has been a long wait for a new 3D Metroid game, lengthened further by Nintendo taking the decision to reboot the project's development back in 2019 after an earlier incarnation being made by Bandai Namco did not meet Nintendo's expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo's current Switch 2 release schedule for the remainder of 2025 includes Drag x Drive (August 14), Kirby and the Forgotten Land — Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World (August 28) and Pokémon Legends Z-A (October 16), plus Kirby Air Riders and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which do not have set dates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

At the time, Sega released what it called a “pre-development concept video” for Virtua Fighter 6, but made clear it did not reflect how the upcoming fighting game would look and play when it eventually comes out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video, below, shown during Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote speech at CES 2025, features incredibly realistic and fluid animations for a fighting game. We see an Akira mirror match with the kind of combat usually reserved for a martial arts movie.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But this new video, which Sega is calling a ‘Combat Gameplay First Look,’ shows buttery smooth animations and cool transitions, with a slow-motion effect for whiffs that makes Virtua Fighter look much more realistic than its fighting game rivals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No infinite juggles, no crazy magic, no stupid invincible ex, no stupid rage art, no spamming rage drive, focus attacks etc. Just pure fighting, I like that,” commented one fan on YouTube.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“VF6 is feeling like those old martial arts films,” added another. “No drive impact, no heat system, no rev system, just straight up hands. I cannot wait for this to drop.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We do see some sort of debilitating effect in the gameplay, where Stella appears to suffer damage to her face, but overall it’s a very clean, back to basics approach for video game fighting.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/04/screenshot-2025-08-04-094427-1754297084498.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Stella emerged victorious over Akira in the first Virtua Fighter 6 gameplay video.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter 6 is in development at Yakuza / Like a Dragon studio Ryo Ga Gotoku and is without a release window or target platforms. Virtua Fighter hasn’t seen a mainline release in years, leaving mini-game appearances in Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s Yakuza games and the 2021 release of Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown to tide fans over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect more on the battle system at the Tokyo Game Show in September. There is no release date yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">At the Evo 2025 fighting game tournament, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/guilty-gear-strive">Guilty Gear Strive</a> developer Arc System Works revealed a first look at Lucy from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/cyberpunk-edgerunners">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a>, and confirmed an August 21 release date for the DLC guest character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lucy is the final playable character from Strive’s Season Pass 4, and is lifted from the hugely popular Cyberpunk: Edgerunners Netflix anime that followed the release of CD Projekt’s Cyberpunk 2077. And anyone who’s played the game will instantly recognize the hacking mechanic we see in the gameplay trailer, below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Time pauses as Lucy selects from a number of Quickhacks, such as Algorithm Malfunction, Optics Inhibition, and Energy Siphon, using Cyberdeck Ram in the same limited fashion you do in Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We then see Lucy’s opponent afflicted with the hacking debuffs via icons that display above their character. These icons are the same from Cyberpunk 2077, and appear to clear quite quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, does Lucy mark the end of DLC for Guilty Gear Stive? Four years after its launch, it seems more is to come. Arc System Works tweeted to say Guilty Gear Strive “will continue… we look forward to your continued support.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GGST?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GGST</a> will continue...<br>We look forward to your continued support.<br>皆様の応援を引き続きよろしくお願いします！<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%AE%E3%83%AB%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AE%E3%82%A2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ギルティギア</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GuiltyGearStrive?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GuiltyGearStrive</a> <a href="https://t.co/lQKiDyIEV3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/lQKiDyIEV3</a></p>— GUILTY GEAR OFFICIAL (@GUILTYGEAR_PR) <a href="https://twitter.com/GUILTYGEAR_PR/status/1952101221357232187?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That message came alongside a video that revealed Strive has had 3.5 million players since launch, and announced Guilty Gear Strive 2.00, coming at some point in 2026. What that means for gameplay is anyone's guess right now. Perhaps of more interest, the video teased two new characters, which fans are speculating are Robo-Ky and Jam Kuradoberi.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Invincible supervillain Omni-Man is a playable character in fighting game Invincible VS. The announcement came as part of the EVO tournament alongside a first look at gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Invincible VS is the upcoming 3v3 tag fighting game set in the Invincible universe. It’s developed by Skybound Entertainment’s first in-house game studio, Quarter Up, and already has a number of confirmed playable characters, including Mark Grayson (Invincible), Atom Eve, Thula, Bulletproof, Rex Splode, and Battle Beast. Now we can add Omni-Man to the list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb on Omni-Man:</p><blockquote>A versatile and brutal fighter, Omni-Man is an excellent pick for or against any team composition. His versatile move set offers options at all ranges: he can apply pressure from a distance with his concussive blast, punish reckless advances with anti-air tools, or close the gap in an instant with his sudden and devastating takedowns. Balanced, efficient and relentless, Omni-Man is a top-tier “point” character for players who want to set the pace from the very first hit.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this isn’t Omni-Man’s first foray into the world of fighting games. He was a popular guest character in the equally gory Mortal Kombat 1, which included some of his iconic scenes as Fatalities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, we now know seven playable characters in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/invincible-vs"><u>Invincible VS</u></a>. There will be more, of course. But just how many? Based on comments from Invincible creator Robert Kirkman in an interview with IGN at San Diego Comic-Con 2025, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robert-kirkman-teases-massive-roster-of-playable-characters-for-invincible-vs-thats-a-spoiler-i-might-get-in-trouble-for-that-sdcc-2025">Invincible VS will have a massive roster</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh from his SDCC 2025 panel where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robert-kirkman-reveals-battle-beast-as-a-playable-character-in-invincible-vs-with-debut-trailer-sdcc-2025"><u>he announced Battle Beast for Invincible VS</u></a>, Kirkman told IGN that if fans are wondering if a specific character from either the Invincible comic or the Prime Video animated series will be in the game, there’s a “99%” chance they will be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There's so much care being put into being true to the Invincible universe,” Kirkman began. “So if you're a fan of the comics or the show and you're like, ‘Oh, there's a fighting game coming, who would I like to be in that fighting game?’ There's a 99% chance they're going to be in the game. I'll just say that. That's a spoiler. I might get in trouble for that. I don't know.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Invincible VS Battle Beast Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirkman continued: “The lineup is going to be absolutely insane. I'm so glad that we announced Battle Beast. You can't do an Invincible fighting game without having Battle Beast be one of the playable characters. There are other characters like that that will more than likely be in the game. So we'll see. We've got a lot of announcements to roll out. There's a really great team working on this and I can't wait for people to see everything is going into it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who would you like to see playable in Invincible VS? Let us know in the comments below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for when Invincible VS will be released, Kirkman said 2026, which we already knew, but then he added: “Sooner than you may think… But next year. I'm not being specific.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out IGN's roundup of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-season-4s-dinosaurus-has-a-voice-actor-robert-kirkman-says-7-9-seasons-needed-to-do-the-complete-comic-arc-jokes-season-5-will-be-out-in-2032-sdcc-2025"><u>everything announced during Robert Kirkman's Invincible panel at SDCC 2025</u></a> for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
