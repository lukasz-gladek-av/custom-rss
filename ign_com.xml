            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-paulines-age-in-donkey-kong-bananza-leaving-fans-wondering-whether-its-a-super-mario-odyssey-prequel-and-if-mario-will-appear-as-a-potential-villain<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has confirmed the age of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> sidekick Pauline, sparking questions regarding the young character's timeline and how Bananza's story will tally with previous titles — such as Mario's original arcade game, where DK was famously portrayed as the villain and Pauline was his abductee.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a character profile found on Donkey Kong Bananza's Japanese website, Nintendo states that Pauline is a "13-year-old girl who loves to sing. She used to live above ground, but for some reason she was brought to the underground world and transformed into a rock."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-confirms-super-mario-odysseys-pauline-is-your-new-sidekick-and-dk-can-now-transform-into-a-zebra-or-flying-ostrich">Yesterday's reveal of this younger Pauline, during the Donkey Kong Bananza Nintendo Direct</a>, strongly suggested she was the same music-loving version of the character seen in Nintendo Switch platformer Super Mario Odyssey, where a grown-up Pauline serves as both the mayor of New Donk City and the lead singer of a popular band.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo fans have been quick to highlight what this might mean for Pauline's overall timeline — and the fact that DK and Pauline's friendly team-up in Bananza is a very different vibe to the pair's usual relationship of kidnapper and victim. Does something happen to DK, turning him evil? Or have we been getting Pauline and DK's friendship wrong all these years?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza sees the two characters working together to help the teenage Pauline get back to the surface, in order to pursue her dream of becoming a world famous singer. Pauline's appearance as a singer in Odyssey suggests that she does indeed make it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while Bananza looks story-wise to be an Odyssey prequel, the exact timeline here is somewhat unclear. Nintendo has never stated Pauline's age in Odyssey, or in any of her other appearances, so it's unknown how long before those events it is that Bananza takes place. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But by linking the character across these games through Pauline's musical ambitions, it also highlights the fact that Odyssey's Pauline does address her kidnapping by DK — something she describes as "traumatic."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Direct Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pauline has been kidnapped by DK multiple times over the years. Most notably, she is saved from DK's clutches in the original Donkey Kong arcade game, but she is then abducted again in various entries within the Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2 series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis, Pauline is snatched by Donkey Kong after the she dares to pick a gift from Mario instead of DK. In Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again!, Pauline is kidnapped once more by an enraged DK, upset that he's missed out on a theme park opening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later entries in the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series paint Pauline's interactions with DK in a kinder light, however, such as in Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move, where the two team up to host a mini-game, and Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars, where the pair plan Mario a surprise party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Does something happen to sour DK and Pauline's relationship at the end of Donkey Kong Bananza, turning the ape from an ally to kidnapper? Will we see the events of the original Donkey Kong arcade game take place within Bananza, perhaps, with Mario coming in to save the day? Or have we been getting it wrong all these years?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans have suggested that Bananza will turn the Mario universe on its head by revealing that DK and Pauline are in fact friends — and that Mario has been the villain all along, effectively stealing Pauline back when she's just been hanging out with her pal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopefully all will be revealed when Donkey Kong Bananza arrives as Nintendo's next major Switch 2 launch on July 17, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-latest-patch-shadowdropped-its-first-enhanced-boss<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The downpour gets heavier.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, the new patch 1.01.3 went live for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>. It was a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-1013-adds-a-little-bit-of-madness-but-players-are-really-happy-about-one-bug-fix">seemingly small patch</a>, centered on bugs and quality-of-life tune-ups. It seemed like most players saw it and went about their day. But then, gradually, some started to notice a new option in their Expeditions menu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A new Gaping Jaw undertaking, dubbed the "Everdark Sovereign," was appearing on the Expeditions menu. Soon it became clear that FromSoftware had delivered on its promise to add enhanced bosses to Elden Ring Nightreign this month, and it did so without warning, letting players potentially stumble into the new venture. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lexykq/wtf_is_this_new/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watching the community piece this together</a>, in the late hours of the night, was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lf04m4/just_a_small_performancebug_fixing_update_nothing/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">truly fantastic</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As confirmed this morning on <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged-elden-ring-nightreign" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bandai Namco's site</a>, enhanced versions of current Nightlords—duibbed Everdark Sovereigns—will start appearing in Elden Ring Nightreign over the coming weeks. Each week, a new Sovereign will arrive in Limveld, with Gaping Jaw as the current Sovereign and both Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight due to get new, more challenging versions as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everdark Sovereigns are only available while online, and each Sovereign will hang around for a week, then leave and get replaced by another one. You have to have beaten the base, original form of the Nightlord to challenge its Everdark Sovereign form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early reports from players indicate that this souped-up Gaping Jaw <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lf1qck/welp_that_was_brutal/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is, truly, enhanced</a>. Videos of the fights show the empowered Adel zipping aruond the field, creating massive storms, and generally wiping the floor with entire trios of players in short order.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you can tackle the Everdark Sovereign solo, or with friends and/or strangers, it seems like the new fight is truly adding some challenge, even for those who have been putting a lot of hours into Elden Ring Nightreign. To me, it's reminiscent of Monster Hunter's upgraded fights that get added post-launch, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/How_to_Beat_Arch-Tempered_Rey_Dau">Tempered versions of monsters</a>, that seem meant to add extra challenge as players' knowledge and power rises exponentially over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's the reward for felling an Everdark Sovereign? Well, a brand-new shop located in the hub area will let you spend all the Sovereign Sigils you'll earn from a clear, and even this shop is a pretty exciting update. Alongside offering special Relics and other items, the Sigils allow playes to change the Roundtable Hold's lighting, acquire the currently available skins, and set shifting earth statuses. The latter has been a major request from the community, and it's great to see it addressed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So while the patch notes for 1.01.3 were fairly unassuming at first, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lf09p1/this_update_fixed_the_game/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players now seem to feel like this is a huge update</a>. The roll-out of enhanced bosses has already brought some new life and challenge back to Nightreign, and the promise of more to come is enticing, as are the new short-term pursuits to chase after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bandai Namco is also teasing this as the start of something: "This is only the beginning of the Everdark Sovereign cycle. As the power of the Night ebbs and wanes, the Sovereigns will soon return to the abyss they came from." We already know Elden Ring Nightreign is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-will-get-dlc-bosses-and-characters-according-to-steam-page-slip-up">due to get full updates</a> down the road, so if this is an early indication of what we can expect, the long-term prospects for FromSoft's new co-op survival action game seem good.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
