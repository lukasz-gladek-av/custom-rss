IGN has reported on Space Marine 2’s modding scene already, shining a light on everything from customization to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-mod-solves-one-of-the-games-biggest-problems">a fix for one of the game’s biggest problems</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remarkably, the changes Space Marine 2 mods make to the Space Marines themselves, whether they’re a purely aesthetic customization not normally possible or certain classes using weapons and equipment they’re not supposed to, can be seen online by other players in public PvE sessions. While Space Marine 2 uses dedicated servers, a lot of the game elements are client-side controlled. So if you’re playing with random players, there’s a chance you might see things like Bulwarks wielding Thunder Hammers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-update-40-secretly-clamped-down-on-pvp-modding-publisher-confirms-but-doesnt-have-a-problem-with-pve-modding"><u>Space Marine 2 publisher Focus Entertainment had confirmed to IGN that it had no problem whatsoever with PvE modding</u></a>, but now, in <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/114-mod-support-a-message-from-the-game-director" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a message to modders</a>, game director Dmitriy Grigorenko has announced changes that impact how Space Marine 2 mods work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grigorenko said Saber had found that a “non-negligible” amount of recent server stability issues were related to mods, and pointed out that instability impacts even those users who don’t have mods installed. Saber has also received user reports that their save files were corrupted after playing alongside players with mods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, with the release of Space Marine 2’s next big update in December, mods will be blocked from public online sessions. That means that you will no longer be able to enter a public game if you have mods installed, Grigorenko warned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mods will still be allowed in private Operations lobbies, however (Space Marine 2 includes three-player co-op missions as part of Operations mode). “We will continue to provide all necessary server infrastructure so you can play online with your friends with mods,” Grigorenko promised. “Once we add custom Eternal War lobbies, mods will work for them as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Saber will also help Space Marine 2 modders out by providing an easy entry point to its backend for games with mods installed, “so modders won’t have to spend time hacking the game executable after each patch.” “If we somehow break this pipeline for mods by accident in the future, we’ll fix it,” Grigorenko vowed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s the big one: Saber will release “some” of its tools to modders so they can develop mods with greater ease.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tom, aka Warhammer Workshop, creator of the popular Astartes Overhaul mod for Space Marine 2, hailed the news, saying official modding tools means no more reverse-engineering. “With official tools on the way, we’re entering a new golden age of modding,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“By moving mods to private and custom lobbies, public servers will stay smooth while modded games get the infrastructure they deserve,” Tom said. “Mods are now a supported part of Space Marine 2, ensuring our creativity continues to enhance the game for years to come.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Tom acknowledged some Space Marine 2 players and modders might feel disappointed that mods won’t work in public lobbies anymore. “But let’s be honest,” he countered, “the other alternative was mods getting shut down completely. Instead, Saber has embraced our community and creativity. This is a huge win for everyone!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Saber Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 had “changed everything” for the company</u></a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-spot-chapter-all-but-confirmed-to-get-cosmetic-pack-after-the-dark-angels"><u>Eagle-eyed fans have spotted the Space Marine chapter now all-but confirmed to get a cosmetic pack after the Dark Angels</u></a>, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

And it's using data collected by Pokémon Go players to do it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/largegeospatialmodel" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official blog post</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/right-wing-social-networks-don-t-work?ref=404media.co" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garbage Day</a> and reported on by <a href="https://www.404media.co/pokemon-go-players-have-unwittingly-trained-ai-to-navigate-the-world/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">404 Media</a>, Niantic revealed that it's building something called a "Large Geospatial Model." You may already know what a "Large Language Model" is - it's Chat GPT. It's an AI that is trained on enormous amounts of existing text so that it can then produce text on its own that sounds normal, and conceivably like what a user might want to hear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Large Geospatial Model is essentially the same idea, but applied to the physical world. It's trained on what real-world places look like (a church, a park, a house, etc), and then it can use that data to produce information on what actual places it hasn't seen yet might look like. Niantic claimed this will be useful for technology such as AR glasses, robotics, content creation, and other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or as Niantic put it:</p><blockquote>Imagine yourself standing behind a church. Let us assume the closest local model has seen only the front entrance of that church, and thus, it will not be able to tell you where you are. The model has never seen the back of that building. But on a global scale, we have seen a lot of churches, thousands of them, all captured by their respective local models at other places worldwide. No church is the same, but many share common characteristics. An LGM [Large Geospatial Model] is a way to access that distributed knowledge.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">But to make this work, Niantic needs lots of data to train that AI on, and it can only do so much on its own. Google's been collecting location data for years via Google Maps and those funny cars it uses to get street view info, but that's not sufficient in this case. Cars can only drive on roads, and Niantic needs pedestrian information from places cars can't go. Fortunately, Niantic has thousands of people globally pointing their phones at things and sending that information back via its various projects and apps, Pokémon Go included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Niantic said in its post that it's been building something called a Visual Positioning System (VPS), a technology that uses an image from a phone to determine the position and orientation of a location on a 3D map. The technology is supposed to allow users to position themselves in the world with "centimeter-level accuracy," which allows them to then see digital content overlayed on the physical world "precisely and realistically." Again, from Niantic:</p><blockquote>This content is persistent in that it stays in a location after you’ve left, and it’s then shareable with others. For example, we recently started rolling out an experimental feature in Pokémon GO, called Pokémon Playgrounds, where the user can place Pokémon at a specific location, and they will remain there for others to see and interact with.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">But all of this technology exists because users are constantly scanning the world with their phones while using Niantic's apps, including Pokémon Go, and have been for years now. Niantic said it currently has 10 million scanned locations around the world, one million usable with its VPS service, and gets one million new scans every single week containing hundreds of discrete images. That's a lot of data.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Niantic said it's using the data explicitly to develop its own technologies that it then turns around and implements into its existing products. However, in recent years there have been <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/7/27/23808499/ai-openai-google-meta-data-privacy-nope" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">numerous concerns</a> over how companies collect data, use it to train AI, and what those AI models might eventually be used for. While today Niantic's LGM work may just be limited to letting us drop cute Pokémon models in the world for other people to find, tomorrow its uses may grow increasingly complex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has reached out to Niantic for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
