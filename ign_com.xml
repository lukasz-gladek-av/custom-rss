            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Pick it up in under an hour at Best Buy.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 console only has two high-profile original games that you can get right now: Mario Kart World Tour and Donkey Kong Bananza. Although both are great games, Donkey Kong Bananza has staunchly entrenched itself as one of the best games of the year and an absolute must-buy game for any Switch 2 owner.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Donkey Kong Bananza is the Only 10/10 Masterpiece of 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only did we rate Donkey Kong a 10/10, it's the <em>only</em> game we've given a Masterpiece rating so far this year. Granted there isn't too much competition in the way of Switch exclusive games for 2025, this has been a fantastic year so far for console gaming in general. We've seen some of the best games released in recent history, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/17/kingdom-come-deliverance-review">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Death Stranding 2</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, all of which got close to a Masterpiece rating but didn't quite hit the mark. That's not to say that Donkey Kong Bananza is necessarily better than those other games since, after all, different people have reviewed each of these games, but it's a testament to just how outstanding Donkey Kong Bananza is on its own merits to have achieved that score.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Pick it up in under an hour at Best Buy</h3><div catalogid="7e14ca20-d3b4-46c3-be95-0d920f6e2169" id="226427"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've read the reviews and are itching to pick up a copy to play immediately, the surest best is ordering online and picking it up in-store at a nearby retailer like Best Buy, Target, or Walmart. Best Buy, for example, offers pickup in as little as one hour. I find it more convenient to order online ahead of time and then picking it up in-store because you're pretty much guaranteed that it will be in stock, and you don't have to wander around the store looking for a copy. If you're looking for a discount, don't hold your breath. I haven't seen any deals this game, and to be honest, I don't expect any before Black Friday. That's not to say you can't find ways to incentivize your purchase. Best Buy, for example, gives you rewards points for every purchase if you sign up for its free membership, and Best Buy cardholders get 5% cashback, similar to Target's Circle card or Amazon's Prime card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still on the fence over getting the Switch 2 console? Check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2 review</a>, in which Tom Mark aptly describes the new console as "a vital but unexciting upgrade to a console I already love."</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 5, 2025 8:05 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-is-the-only-ign-masterpiece-in-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/persona-5-royal-leads-augusts-humble-choice-bundle-alongside-tons-of-cozy-games.1262946/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Finish 'em. </h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Humble Bundle has announced its Humble Choice lineup for August. For just $14.99, you’ll get access to a solid selection of games, including one of my personal favorites, Persona 5 Royal. For reference, P5R’s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1687950/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest recorded price on Steam</a> is $23.99, making just that game alone a crazy steal. Even better, you get seven more games (and the feeling of giving back) out of it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Humble Choice August 2025 Game Lineup </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Each month, Humble Choice curates a selection of games for members to redeem. These games are sent as Steam codes, which you can keep forever, making Humble Choice one of our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-subscription-services">favorite gaming subscriptions</a>. Here's what Humble Choice members are getting in August: </p><div catalogid="f5ee5aee-bdfd-43a2-b5bb-4f4dbc146197" id="226429"><div id="226429" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Humble Choice August 2025</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Eight games, discounts on the Humble Bundle store, and one month of IGN Plus.</p></div></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Persona 5 Royal </li><li>Banishers: Ghost of New Eden</li><li>My Time at Sandrock 	</li><li>Let’s School </li><li>Lil Gator Game</li><li>Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip </li><li>Wildmender  </li><li>Warpips</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">As noted, the highlight this month is certainly Persona 5 Royal. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-royal-review"><u>IGN’s 10/10 review</u></a>, Leana Hafer goes so far as to say, “Persona 5 was already a strong front-runner for being the best JRPG ever made, and Royal really gets me wondering what else could even compete.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The social links in Persona 5 Royal are a big standout for me, even compared to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">rest of the Persona franchise</a>. Every “Palace” (basically a dungeon) feels like a full season of an anime, with solid character development, laughs, and yes, plenty of emotional moments. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you recently played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-game-of-2024">IGN’s 2024 Game of the Year</a>, Metaphor: Refantazio, this is a great chance to check out Atlus’ hallmark series with plenty of the same mechanics. Otherwise, I highly recommend this entry point to anyone who’s considered getting into the modern generation of turn-based JRPGs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">August’s Humble Choice bundle also includes a solid selection of more casual games, including the co-op gardening survival game, Wildmender, and the cozy farming sim My Life at Sandrock, which, like many cozy games, is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/bomoore/lists/games-like-stardew-valley">a lot like Stardew Valley</a>. You’ll also pick up Banishers: Ghost of New Eden, an action RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review"><u>IGN’s review</u></a> describes as having “a solid concept and a stellar paranormal investigation system.” Again, all of this for just $14.99. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>5% of Humble Choice Proceeds Go to Charity </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Every month, 5% of the proceeds from Humble Choice members go to a charity chosen by Humble itself. This month, those proceeds are going to <a href="https://donorschoose.org/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DonorsChoose.org</u></a>, an organization that helps teachers and educators get access to the resources they need in the classroom. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You spend a lot of time in P5R studying for exams (I promise it’s fun), so this bundle makes sense to me. Charity Navigator and GuideStar have also awarded DonorsChoose, a 501(c)3 nonprofit, their highest ratings for transparency and accountability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Humble Bundle is part of IGN Entertainment, the division of Ziff Davis that includes GamesIndustry.biz, IGN, and MapGenie.</em>

Both games feature a round-headed protagonist whose goal is to climb a mountain at the center of an island, an activity that can be accomplished either alone or with friends. Cliff even calls out in its description that it's inspired by Peak!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though, "inspired" might be a bit generous. Take a look at the two game descriptions side-by-side. Here's Peak:</p><blockquote>PEAK is a co-op climbing game where the slightest mistake can spell your doom. Either solo or as a group of lost nature scouts, your only hope of rescue from a mysterious island is to scale the mountain at its center. Do you have what it takes to reach the PEAK?<p>WORK TOGETHER</p></blockquote><blockquote>Need a Hand? You’ll need to rely on your friends to have any hope of scaling the mountain, which changes every single day. Help each other up ledges, or place ropes and climbing spikes to make the way easier for those who come after.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">And this is Cliff:</p><blockquote>⛰️CLIFF is a challenging climbing game where even the smallest mistake can be your downfall. Trapped on a mysterious island, your only way to escape is to reach the top of the towering cliff. Do you have the skill and courage to make it to the summit?</blockquote><blockquote>✋WORK TOGETHER</blockquote><blockquote>Need some help? You’ll have to rely on your friends if you want any chance of reaching the top. The mountain is tough, so help each other up ledges and watch out for dangers to make the climb easier for those who come after you.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Woof, that's...the same? It's essentially just the same description copied wholesale with some swapped synonyms. And a comparison of the Badges for Cliff and the Steam Achievements for Peak reveals that Cliff also named its "Shore" and "Tropics" biomes directly after Peak's locations of the same names.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest material difference between the two games, apart from things like quality and scope, is that Cliff has microtransactions. You can buy certain items using Robux including a Climbing Pickaxe, a Parrot Friend, and a Starterpack. Peak doesn't have any such thing. It's $8 for the game itself, and that's it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is unfortunately a common phenomenon on Roblox. Plug the name of just about any game, AAA or indie, into Roblox's search feature and you'll find countless clones. On just a quick search I was able to find microtransaction-filled variations on Pokemon, Mario, Sonic, Undertale, Untitled Goose Game, Five Nights at Freddy's (woof, there are LOADS of those), Fortnite, Elden Ring, Stardew Valley, Celeste...I could go on. Some of these games are marketed as homages or fangames, but many just straight-up use stolen assets from the games they're based on, and others are pretty blatant clones trying to disguise themselves by changing some proper nouns around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given Roblox's historical <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-makes-big-changes-to-parental-controls-amid-pedophile-hellscape-report">whack-a-mole approach to moderation</a> it's hard to say whether or not Aggro Crab's callout will have any effect on Cliff. But at least the studio has made its wishes known. Probably, the solution is just to buy Peak. But if you're so desperate you're going to play Cliff instead, the developers would prefer you engage in some piracy instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm a massive fan of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player board games</a>, especially ones that are designed specifically for head-to-head or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> play like 7 Wonders: Duel, Sky Team, and Splendor: Duel. These games tend to play faster than those with larger player counts, but still offer the juicy decision-making I crave. So when I heard about Zenith, a new tug-of-war-style dueling game set in space, I was immediately intrigued. Zenith features strategic resource management, high player interaction, cards, light engine-building, and a tech track – all packed into an experience that plays in under 30 minutes (making it a good <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">quick-playing board game</a>). It checks all the boxes for me and has quickly become one of my favorite games to pull off the shelf.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What's in the Box</h2><div catalogid="a30e96ef-17d6-47f2-88b0-73b35d89d8d4" id="225510"><div id="225510" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zenith Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Zenith manages to pack a lot of components into a relatively small box. Inside, you'll find three separate game boards (Planet, Technology, and Diplomacy), that connect together to create the main play area. The Technology boards are double-sided, allowing you to mix-and-match to create a randomized progression track before each game that players will need to adapt their strategy to match. Each player uses a set of wooden tech markers to track their progress during the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of small cardboard pieces to remove from the punchboards before you start, including three different credit denominations which function as the game's primary currency, bonus tokens, and the Leader badge. The rest of the components are made from high-quality recycled materials, including 80% wood, and all feature an etched design. They have a nice weight to them, and also smell great (who doesn't love the smell of fresh wood?)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zenith's other currency, the aptly-named Zenithium, is represented by a set of yellow wooden tokens. Players primarily interact with each other during the game through the Influence disks that are placed on the Planet board. Each disk features a different color and etched design to represent one of the five planets you're vying for control over: Mercury, Venus, Terra, Mars, and Jupiter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay in Zenith revolves around its deck of more than 90 unique Agent cards split across the three factions. Each Agent card includes a name and playful character artwork, many of which are subtle nods to famous sci-fi icons like Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick, Frank Herbert, Ray Bradbury, and George Lucas, just to name a few. I had a blast trying to figure out the dozens of references sprinkled throughout the deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the relatively short instruction manual, Zenith also includes two player reference cards that outline turn structure, as well as two double-sided aids that explain the myriad effects found on the Agent cards and Tech board.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the surface, Zenith is a very straightforward game; the first player to take control of the senate wins. This can be achieved in one of three ways: controlling three of the same planet, controlling four unique planets, or controlling any five planets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You gain control of a planet when you have enough Influence, indicated by the colored disks on the Planet board. Each planet has a track with nine spaces: four on your side, four on your opponent's side, and one in the middle. Throughout the game, you and your opponent play cards and develop technology to move each of the five Influence disks back and forth across their corresponding tracks as you try to achieve one of the victory conditions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To set up, players sit opposite one another with the Planet board in the middle. Three Tech boards are chosen at random (one for each faction) that connect to one side of the Planet board, with the Diplomacy board connecting to the other side. Each of boards has a distinct pattern on the bottom that ensures it's connected to the correct side of the Planet board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players randomly distribute the bonus tokens across the Planet and Tech boards, take 12 credits and one Zenithium, and draw four cards from the deck to make their starting hand. Because the hand sizes are small, you can mulligan any number of cards to give you the best possible start. Once players have finalized their hand, the game is ready to begin.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Zenith features strategic resource management, high player interaction, cards, light engine-building, and a tech track – all packed into an experience that plays in under 30 minutes</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Players take turns performing one of three actions during their turn: recruit an Agent, develop a technology, or become the Leader. To recruit an Agent, you play a card from your hand, paying for its cost in credits and applying the card's effects. Every card in the deck has a unique effect, and there is a <em>lot</em> of iconography to remember, so you'll likely be relying on the effect description aid quite a bit during your first few games. Each Agent card gains you at least one influence on the corresponding planet, which allows you to move the matching Influence disk towards your side of the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you recruit Agents, they are placed in a column below the corresponding planet. Each Agent that has been played provides a discount of one credit for future Agents of the same color. This light <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine-building</a> component incentivizes recruiting multiple Agents to the same planet and allows you to play more powerful Agents without disrupting your economy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An alternate action you can take during your turn is developing a technology, which is tracked on the Technology board. Each of the three Tech boards represent one of the game's three factions: Humans, Robots, and Animods, which are basically just anthropomorphic animals. Instead of recruiting an Agent (playing the card from your hand to gain influence), you can play the corresponding faction to its Tech track after paying the required cost in Zenithium. However, this resource can also be used to unlock powerful effects on certain cards, so you'll need to manage your reserves wisely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each faction's Tech track contains five spaces that increase in cost incrementally as you move up, while providing more powerful effects. The first space of each column only costs one Zenithium and has a relatively lackluster effect. But, each time you move up the Tech track, you'll get to perform every action below it when you move up to the next level. This makes the Technology board an important part of your strategy, as it can have game-altering effects as you reach the top.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early on, though, investing in the tech track can feel like a loss of momentum as it doesn't immediately help you gain Influence, so you'll need to balance this carefully as part of your strategy. While investing in a single faction's tech track has increasingly powerful rewards, investing in all three factions equally is another viable option as it provides you Influence when every faction reaches the next tier. The Tech board is an important part of the overall game and shouldn't be ignored, or you'll quickly lose ground to your opponent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last action you can choose to perform during your turn is becoming the Leader of a faction. By discarding a specific faction's card, you gain a one-time effect, as well as the Leader badge. Each faction has a different effect that helps improve your economy: Humans provide you with 4 credits, Robots give you one Zenithium, and Animods allow you to mobilize two cards (place two cards from the top of your deck under the corresponding planet without applying their effect).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Leader badge is important because it increases your hand size while holding it (the only way to do so), while also unlocking powerful bonus effects on some cards. This coveted component often makes for a mini tug-of-war game within the greater game as both players try to keep it in their control and reap its benefits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the strategy in Zenith boils down to carefully managing your resources. Between credits, Zenithium, your recruited Agents, and the cards in your hand, it's a delicate balance as you try to gain tempo over your opponent. Low on credits? You won't be able to play any Agents from your hand. Low on Zenithium? You progress on the Tech board is stalled until you manage to get some more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only aspect that you have little control over is the cards in your hand, as you always draw up to your hand size at the end of your turn and can't discard anything in your hand that isn't useful (with the exception of one Agent that allows you to dump your entire hand when played). While uncommon, there are moments where you can effectively brick while digging for a specific color card or faction. Most of the time it's the result of poorly mismanaging your resources, but when it happens it feels bad to watch your opponent gain momentum. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zenith features a high level of player interaction, but never manages to feel unfair. Many cards feature effects that disrupt your opponent's board state like Transfer, which allows you to move an Agent from your opponent's side of the board to the matching column on your side, or Exile, which lets you discard one of the Agents on your opponent's side. Investing in the various Tech tracks can allow you to take some credits or Zenithium, but they have a finite number of uses. While these effects can be annoying, one aspect about Zenith that I appreciate is that there's absolutely no way to disrupt your opponent's hand or outright drain their economy by playing cards. This creates a level playing field for both players and limits the amount of "bullying" that just feels bad in other games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Zenith is designed for two players, there's a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">4-player</a> version that pits two teams against one another. While the rules are largely the same, teammates control their own hand of Agents that they can't discuss with one another, and can only recruit Agents on the three planets on their half of the board. When obtaining the Leader badge, that player can choose to give two cards to their teammate, but otherwise can't share any resources. It's an interesting twist on the standard game, but Zenith truly shines best at the intended two player count.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Zenith</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QbbkrE?object_uuid=ba928005-74cc-4887-a40f-c9a611e1b2fd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DNR4VHPQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">More Two-Player Board Games We Recommend</h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 5, 2025 5:58 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Zenith is a strategic space duel for two where players fight over control of five planets by gaining the most influence. Throughout the game, players will play cards from their hand to recruit Agents with powerful effects, develop technology to swing the game in their favor, and appoint themselves Leader of one of three factions as they grapple for victory. It features a high level of strategic yet fair player interaction that challenges both players to carefully manage their resources, or risk losing tempo to their opponent. With meaningful decisions and tense tug-of-war gameplay packed into a brisk 30-minute experience, Zenith has quickly become one of my favorite two-player games to pull off the shelf.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/zenith-board-game-review-galactic-tug-of-war-for-two]]></content:encoded>

There are usually 5 Commons, 4 Uncommons, 5 Rare or Mythic Rare cards, a Land and a Token, but the rub here is that 6 of the included cards have a 'booster Fun frame' and 12-13 of them are foil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Surprisingly, stock is already running low on Amazon for most Edge of Eternities boosters. That said, sites like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-where-to-buy">TCGPlayer</a> still have a solid supply, and in some cases, better prices too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.
