Jacksepticeye streamed the game extensively at the time it came out, and often mentions it as one of his favorites.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/31/jack-1743416008894.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Jacksepticeye was working on a Soma animated show. Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for QTCinderella.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the video, Jacksepticeye talked generally about what has been a difficult period creatively following various projects that have either been canceled or failed to progress far enough to show his fans. Lamenting his lack of content creation lately, Jacksepticeye then revealed the Soma animated show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I had a very large creative project that I was very excited to do, and — I don’t actually know if I’m allowed to say what it is — I’m just going to say what it is, and then if I’m not allowed to say it then this next part won’t be in it,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was planning to do a Soma animated show. Because I love Soma — Soma is top five, top 10 at least video games of all time for me. I absolutely love that game. It has one of the best stories ever in a video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I was so excited to do that. We’ve been talking to the developers for like a year, talking about that, and we were ready to go into full production on that. And I was so excited, and I really wanted to announce that to people, and to talk about it and get really stuck in and share it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because I wanted to play the game all in one video. And I was like, okay, I’ll hold off on that then till we can announce that we’re doing it. So that’s why I haven’t done it yet.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Jacksepticeye went on to say the Soma animated show fell apart abruptly after an unnamed party suggested they wanted to do “in a different direction,” but he deliberately left out specifics because he was left so upset.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We were making really great progress on that, and then it all just fell apart out of nowhere,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m not going to go into too many of the specifics of what happened, because I’m quite upset about what actually went down. But, it’s more of a, ‘we’re going in a different direction,’ kinda vibe. And that really upset me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jacksepticeye did not name the other parties involved. IGN has asked Frictional for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upset is the cancelation of Jacksepticeye’s Soma animated show “flipped” the YouTuber’s plans for 2025 “upside down.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I had planned a lot of my year around it. I was like, you know what? I won’t be able to upload as much because I’ll be focusing everything I have into that. But at least I’ll have a really cool creative thing to show off. And I’ll have something for you and we can talk about it and share it and be part of this thing together and have fun with it. And then it all fell apart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So all of my plans for the year are flipped upside down. Now what is the priority? What am I doing? I don’t know. I’ve had so many calls over the last couple of weeks. It’s been a lot. It’s been a tough month. I took time off and did all that and I have nothing at the end of it. It’s so frustrating. I hate that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the release of Soma, Frictional released two more Amnesia games: 2020’s Amnesia: Rebirth and 2023’s Amnesia: The Bunker. In July 2023, in the wake of the release of Amnesia: The Bunker, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amnesia-developer-frictional-games-cutting-back-on-horror">Frictional creative director Thomas Grip said the company was looking to cut back on horror games</a> "to give greater focus on other emotional qualities.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While all of our games have been horror in some way, what we really try to do is to get a kind of playable immersion," Grip said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want to give the player some sort of immersive fantasy, be that being a [World War 1] soldier trapped in a bunker or a robot stuck at the bottom of the ocean.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Horror games naturally are where emotions are front and centre. Games really excel at this. However, we are also exploring themes outside of making things spooky."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

It pointed to the introduction of crossplay and the day-one launch across console and PC (World launched on PC half a year after console) as key factors in Wilds' appeal.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The title provides an environment where a wider range of players can enjoy the game together with the introduction of crossplay, a first for the series, and a simultaneous release on Playstation 5 system, Xbox Series X|S, and PC," Capcom explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Additionally, the introduction of the new Focus Mode mechanic and the implementation of seamless movement between settlements and ecosystems have provided an even more immersive gaming experience, while the fusion of numerous new elements with Monster Hunter’s appeal has generated significant excitement, all of which led to the company first-month sales record of over 10 million units sold."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As detailed last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-has-a-release-date-and-loads-more-details-title-update-2-set-for-summer-2025">Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 1</a> launches April 4.
