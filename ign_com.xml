            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-elden-ring-nightreigns-combat-designer-aimed-to-speed-up-the-action-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As our exclusive IGN First coverage of Elden Ring Nightreign continues, we bring you our interview with game and combat designer Takuya Miyazawa. Enjoy!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>To start, can you describe what it's like working at FromSoftware and getting to work on such highly acclaimed titles like Elden Ring and Nightreign?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takuya Miyazawa - Game and Combat Designer on Nightreign:
</strong>I, myself, previously a huge Souls fan. I'm a big fan of these games and what the company's made, so it's a huge honor to get to work on such titles and as well as the fun of creating these games. I do feel a little bit of pressure and responsibility from the fans who enjoy these games as well, so thank you.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Going into Nightreign, there are a lot of really subtle differences between the combat mechanics of base Elden Ring and Nightreign. Can you talk a little bit about why you felt like you should change up some of those mechanics for a multiplayer game like Nightreign and how the resulting gameplay fits Nightreign's fast-paced multiplayer style a little bit better?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, the changes for the design of Nightreign… Well first, let me give a little introduction to the general design of Nightreign itself. So, as you know, it uses Elden Ring as a base for the design, so the world and a lot of the assets and the base combat flow comes from Elden Ring. But while it does use it as a base for enemies and such, one area that we wanted to focus on with Nightreign was how we encounter these enemies, the flow of the battle, and the abilities you can use. And so having Elden Ring as a base allowed us to branch out and experiment in these other areas, making it into something that stood out from Elden Ring and becoming its own new thing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"While the game base sits with Elden Ring at its core, we wanted to create a gameplay experience that was ultimately very different."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So while the game base sits with Elden Ring at its core, we wanted to create a gameplay experience that was ultimately very different. Elden Ring is a much more slow-paced, a lot more open-ended. You take your time and carefully go through the world, but Nightreign is what we're calling a short RPG. So there are some constraints here. For example, the three-day, three-night time aspect, and the limitations on the player; but at the same time while we’re putting these limitations on the player in terms of structure, we wanted to allow them some freedom points that they didn't otherwise have with Elden Ring. So the way they traverse the map, they can sprint and they can clamber up walls quickly. Let's see… there's no fall damage compared to Elden Ring. So while we put these constraints on the players from a structural point of view, we wanted to open up and allow them this freedom from a gameplay point of view as well. So it was about creating that balance and that contrast.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of status leveling and how the players build their character: With Elden Ring, of course, you had a character creation and building from the very start, but with Nightreign, you select from a preset character as a sort of archetype to start with and then you're free to change your weapons, change your equipment, and change your play style a little bit on the fly. So while you could start as a tank, you don't necessarily have to fulfill that tank role from a gameplay perspective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We wanted players to enjoy the role play of each character more from their sort of character traits and their abilities than a sort of preconceived notion of approach. We also wanted to reduce the amount of time players spend in the menu, actually, within the game. So instead of carefully checking their stats and going through the leveling process, it's a lot more on the fly, it's a lot more ad hoc, and we wanted to reduce and condense these elements that we found in our previous games but in a tighter, more compact experience, this short-form RPG experience for Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So those are just a few of the aspects that we've tried to consider when approaching this from a multiplayer co-op standpoint.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The boss that we got to check out today as we were playing was Libra: Creature of Night</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So for this particular boss battle… Obviously for each boss battle in the game, we're trying to give them their own idiosyncrasies and their own unique touches to make them stand apart and feel original. We wanted each of them to feel like their own experience. So with Libra in particular, we kind of added this trade-off feature that takes place before the battle. And of course, this can allow the players to acquire a new special weapon or a significant level-up or something that benefits them. But of course, being the nature of Libra and the nature of the game, it's not always going to be exactly in their favor, so we wanted to create this interesting risk-reward sort of feature for this particular boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the actual experience during combat itself, we wanted this sort of nature of Libra to be reflected in the gameplay as well. So this sort of duality aspect of the character, both in terms of its appearance and its behavior. So we wanted to give it a two-type move set. So first, it has the sorceries and traps that can kind of confuse and trick the player and then also the sort of more power and damage-focused attacks that come as well. So we wanted this duality to reflect both in its appearance and the pre-battle and the gameplay experience as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One of the things that really struck me about the boss battle was that it almost reminded me of an MMO raid kind of boss with how you had to work together and coordinate with your squad to avoid the full effect of some of its attacks. Was MMO boss design any kind of inspiration in creating this boss fight and if not, what really inspired you in those aspects of the boss design?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, we paid attention to other genres such as MMOs and the boss fights within them and we did take some notes and some inspiration from these. But one thing we wanted to be careful of was the fact that seeing as Nightreign is a co-op, multiplayer focused game, we still wanted to take care during these boss fights that when another player is drawing aggro, the boss still feels like a significant threat to other players in the group. So even if another player is drawing the aggro, the attacks that the boss is going to do and the way it's behaving is still going to keep other players on their toes even if they're sort of flanking it or taking a more solo-oriented approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I definitely felt that, by the way. Feeling threatened even while I didn’t hold the aggro of the boss. Shifting gears to classes, what goes into designing a character class for Nightreign? Are you looking to fill specific archetypes? Do you come up with a cool idea for a skill and then design a class based around that, or what does that process really look like?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's quite an unorthodox approach we took to character design in Nightreign, similar to what we started with in Elden Ring. So for instance, we start with these kind of general roles or role titles for each of the characters, such as the tank we mentioned earlier or a mage type. So we start with these very general and loose kind of bases for the character archetype. And then from the director, we get an idea of the characters and their individuality and the sorts of abilities that they're going to use and things like this.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to give one example of that. You might have used her in the network test or in your play session, the Recluse. Her archetype actually started as a mage, a magic user, plain and simple. But from there, we started to think about and discuss what's fun and what's interesting about playing as a mage from a player's perspective. And that is, of course, using magic, using your intellect to kind of suss out the enemy and its weaknesses and sort of piece the puzzles of the battle together as you go. Of course, just blasting magic is fun in itself, but we wanted there to be an extra layer to that such as how you use your resources, the timing of your spells, using multiple spells in conjunction. And so we started to design a system around that new kind of concept of a mage and how players would interact with that. So that's the kind of approach we took to the character design.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"One area we did concentrate on is the feeling of a role or responsibility within each character."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another aspect of our approach to the class designs was how you engage with them in a multiplayer environment. So of course, Nightreign is a three-player co-op game at its core and we wanted these skills and characters to be interesting both from a solo and multiplayer perspective. So one example of this could be the restage skill of the Duchess. So obviously, this is a very powerful skill when you're playing in solo play, but if you're going to take it to the next level and master it, a nice idea might be to watch what your allies are doing, watch for when they're doing some big damage and then restage their attack patterns and get some extra damage that way. So it really encourages this sort of teamwork and thinking as a group and thinking in terms of co-op play.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This is really the first from Soft Souls with fully developed, pre-made classes that each have their own unique skills and abilities. Does that have any effect, or rather, does it raise any challenges with regards to how you design bosses or enemy encounters, knowing the powerful tools that a squad will be able to take into a fight?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of each character's individual abilities and their ultimates and skills, we didn't want to have that dictate how we approach the enemy design or encounter design and vice versa as well. We didn't want the player action level to infringe too much on the enemy action level. We wanted to concentrate on these characters and making them feel unique and fun to players in and of themselves, first and foremost, rather than having these encounters and these boss battles sort of affect that negatively and impact the fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One area we did concentrate on is the feeling of a role or responsibility within each character. So you might have somebody who feels it's their duty to try and protect the others during a difficult boss fight or try and distract the enemies, the adds (enemies) during a certain boss fight. Something like this was a feature of the pre-made designs that we could include in Nightreign that maybe we didn't experiment with too much in previous titles.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, another aspect is because this is a co-op game that focuses on having a three-person team, we did want to make the bosses feel particularly hardcore from that standpoint as well. So they will use very large-scale attacks. They will use certain abilities that will inhibit or restrict the player or kind of put a sort of urgency to their moves like the timer that's inflicted on them in the Gladius Boss fight. Things like this, we really wanted to make them feel unique and imposing in each their own way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You mentioned the Duchess ability and comboing that with a very strong ability that one of your allies will use. Do you have any other favorite ability combos or synergies from the available character classes?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another example I could give is the Raider character who raises a giant totem from the earth. This itself does damage to the enemies and bosses, but at the same time, the different characters can clamber up atop it. So you could, for example, have the Ironeye character raining down arrows from the safety of the tombstone or reviving a character by shooting them with long-range attacks. Something like this, we feel that there's a nice breadth and synergy that you can experiment with each of these characters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another example might be a more general example is the Recluse who you could also use in the network test. Her ultimate art actually marks enemies, puts this sort of seal on them which grants you HP and your teammates HP as you attack. So this, used in conjunction with high damage output or fast subsequent attacks from your teammates, could be very effective at healing the team, keeping them alive. Things like this, we hope players will really have fun experimenting and playing around with these different combinations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Was the Libra Boss battle inspired by any specific characters or mythos?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, he can't speak to any specific titles or names. One of the main inspirations for the Libra Boss battle was this sort of massively multiplayer raid battle sort of focus, so with this idea of having a lot of players coming together to fight this boss battle together. This involves not only the kind of exciting and dangerous elements of that fight, but also the puzzle elements as well, sort of figuring out the right time to attack, figuring out the time to retreat, figuring out the different elements to this boss fight. So we wanted it to feel like an intelligent boss design rather than just an all in, every man for himself kind of appeal.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Personally, what Nightreign character is your favorite to play and what is a build that you really hope players will dig into and enjoy?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">A personal favorite of mine is the Guardian, the avian-type knight character with the shield. He favors a more defensive-y and tank-y kind of build that this character archetype provides. I enjoy being able to both attack and defend at the same time or provide that kind of bulwark and that area of safety for his team. If players are more not so keen on the fast dodge rolling and sort of the perfect timing of the parries and things like that, this is a nice character for them to feel like they're really contributing to the team aspect and able to enjoy the battle in that sense as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generally, we designed the game for the players to be able to beat it as any character. So we wanted them to feel like they could choose a character they liked, either from an ability standpoint or from an appearance or backstory standpoint, and beat the game just in their own play style and with a character they enjoy. That said, balance is still important and the team synergy we talked to, finding a good balance of, say, a tank type character, a mage type character, and a damage deal type character. This is often important as is the boss selection that you make as well. So sometimes, a different Nightlord Boss fight will encourage a different synergy or a different sort of group of roles, a different team composition. So we want players to enjoy figuring out these aspects and experiment with various characters and while they're doing that, find some that really resonate with them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We really wanted both the boss characters, these encounters, and the player characters themselves to feel unique each in their own way. And we wanted it to feel unique enough that players can go back to the game and approach with another character entirely. So even if they have beaten a boss with the Guardian, they might want to go back and try it as the Recluse and see what other tricks they can come up with. Players also might enjoy doing a three-Recluse team, so tripling up on a certain character and seeing what kind of crazy stunts they can come up with, so I'm really looking forward to that aspect of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Final question, and this might be the hardest one, but just what are some of your favorite video games?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I mentioned earlier, I really like From’s games, these action RPGs that we make. I'm also a big long-time fan of Final Fantasy 14 and other multiplayer online games as well.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

"But when we were working on an early version of a course in this game set on a ranch that players can drive through, this sketch came up."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The sketch, which shows a smiling Cow driving a truck and looking like she does not have a care in the world, was immediately seized upon as inspiration for Cow to become Mario Kart's next playable character — and led to other background NPCs becoming playable, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Each new Mario Kart game features new characters to race with, but since we added so many to the previous game, we wondered where we could go from there," art director Masaaki Ishikawa continued. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And then one of the designers came up with that silly sketch of Cow cruising along, and I thought to myself, 'This is it!' (Laughs) So that's when we realized the course surroundings actually contained a lot of untapped resources."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/21/image-1747839986951.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mario Kart World's Cow concept art. Image credit: Nintendo.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cow's addition to the Mario Kart World roster was quickly followed by Cheep Cheep (the red fish Mario often has to dodge) and Pokey (the smiling, wiggling cactus character) also becoming playable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was like, 'They're NPCs, but they're playable? Which is it?'" Yabuki continued. "It's pretty funny to see a four-legged Cow holding onto motorcycle handlebars with her front hooves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But when she jumps, she strikes a proper quadrupedal pose," Ishikawa added. "So I'm pretty sure Cow is still in touch with her animal nature. (Laughs)"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in the same interview, Yabuki confirmed that Nintendo had the name Mario Kart World in mind "from the early stages of development" when the game's open-world nature was already being worked on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If the idea had just been to add more courses, then I think we would've called it Mario Kart 9," Yabuki said. "But, that wasn't our approach this time. We wanted to take the series to the next level. So, we decided to drop the numbering this time and go with a completely new title."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Kart World Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the development team discussed Mario Kart World's addition of unlockable character costumes, found by snacking on food at Yoshi's drive-thru restaurants in different in-game regions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each region will unlock its own costumes, and offer its own food varieties. One example given is a Yoshi's drive-thru in a volcano region selling hot soup inspired by Bowser.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally, Nintendo says it hadn't linked its ideas for unlockable costumes and food together, with the former simply being planned to be purchasable from in-game shop locations. But stopping at these interrupted the game's open-world driving experience, developers said, and anyway — didn't Mario magically transform costumes already when he gobbled food up?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The question came up: 'Does Mario, in fact, eat mushrooms?'," Yabuki laughed. The query prompted Mario Kart World's development team to hunt down Nintendo legend Takashi Tezuka, and get his verdict.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Tezuka-san [answered], 'Yeah, he is'," Yabuki confirmed. And thus, Mario Kart World's costume-producing food was born.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the biggest surprise to come out of the interview was the revelation that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-began-development-on-switch-1-and-suffered-performance-struggles-until-switch-2-delay-offered-ray-of-hope">Mario Kart World began development on Nintendo Switch, before performance concerns led to the game being delayed</a> for launch on Switch 2 instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World, and Cow, will arrive on Switch 2 on the console's launch day — June 5, 2025.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-overture-wears-its-bloodborne-inspiration-proudly-on-its-sleeve<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2021, Round 8 and NEOWIZ announced Lies of P, a moody soulslike that answered the question that no one had thought to ask: What if Bloodborne was actually a Victorian reimagining of Carlo Collodi’s Pinocchio? When it launched in 2023, it surprised skeptics and over-delivered in both how great its dark fantasy setting was and how incredibly fun its aggressive combat was. Two years later, I got to spend some quality time with Overture, the ironically-named encore of an expansion to the hit action game. And even though I didn’t get to see much more than around an hour of the first stage and the new Boss Memories mode, it was apparent very quickly that the South Korean team is poised to overachieve yet again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overture is a prequel to the events of Lies of P, right before the puppet frenzy starts and robotic thralls massacre everyone in the city of Krat. But as it turns out, many of its ideas for settings, weapons, etc. were actually meant for the base game, but got cut to keep the original release from being too bloated. Round 8 studio Game Director Jiwon Choi told IGN in an interview that he and his team weren’t content with letting these ideas go undeveloped and unrealized. Through a translator, he described Lies of P as finally “complete” with the addition of Overture.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Lies of P: Overture Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Lies of P has always been associated with Bloodborne, mostly because of how it looks but also because combat in both games adheres to soulslike traditions but forgo key behaviors like blocking. Even releasing a big DLC well after launch to put a bow on the original project has become a FromSoftware signature at this point. But Choi’s team embraces the comparison. “It is our honor [to be compared to FromSoftware].” He added that it motivates them to make something that can clear that high bar of expectation and they can only hope that they did with Lies of P, and will continue to do so in Overture.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Lies of P team embraces the Bloodborne comparison.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first steps you take back in the boots of the titular character, P, is into the snow-packed region around the Krat Zoo, a building your disembodied guide, Gemini, seems very confused to see standing and not a pile of embers. Story details are light, and the developers are staying tight lipped about anything we haven't seen so far. After some preamble from your lantern cricket, it was very difficult not to spend a couple of seconds swinging around one of the brand new weapons in Overture: a gunblade that looks exactly like the kind Squall Leonheart would get commissioned for himself. This was one of a few new weapon types I chopped my way through this frozen menagerie with, on top of new weapons from existing types, and a pair of new, very cool, legion arms that did very different, yet very effective kinds of asskicking.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pale Knight, as the gunblade’s called, was my main weapon against the ergo-poisoned monsters both on the outskirts of the zoo and within its walls. It has the weight and attack pattern similar to a greatsword, but its heavy attack pulls the trigger and the double barrel firearm attached sends lead screaming at foes. The recoil of these shots push P around, so it can be useful when mixed into attack strings to remain evasive. A trick I learned far too late in my demo is that you can actually fire the weapon again to rocket yourself back towards the bad guys for a big follow-up attack. So basically, it's the coolest weapon ever made.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another new weapon type I dabbled with is the bow, the first completely ranged weapon in the series. It felt perfect for poking smaller enemies from afar but pretty incapable of making a reasonable mark on larger foes. I think with time there’s probably a way to exploit its perfect draw mechanic to menace all sorts of baddies from down range, but I couldn’t manage it in the hour I had. Another new weapon type I wish I spent more time with were a pair of long claws that shredded enemies with the kind of fury that is usually reserved for Best There Is At What He Does. This didn’t scratch the surface of weapons I glossed over that were clearly new additions to existing weapon types, but it was abundantly clear to me that people who really love the weapon customization aspect of the base game will have a lot of new toys to mash together in Overture.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The new legion arms I tried out also made great additions to P’s kit. My favorite was yet another gun: double-barrelled and chargeable to moderate the kind of force, spread, and impact on the bad guys. It’s a more close-ranged option, but even at half charge it made short work of the fodder that roamed around the snowy grounds or dilapidated halls of the zoo itself. At full charge, it was a reliable tool to stun bigger foes or at least interrupt their bevy of attacks for a second. I came to the second arm late in the demo, but it was certainly a strong offensive option in its own right. It launched blades that would swirl around enemies for a short time, similar to the throwable saw blade item, with two differences. One, it can fire multiple blades at once to do some significant damage over time on one target, and two, with a quick press of a button before releasing the flying blade, you can change the attack completely to a set of blades that dance around P instead, great for doing solid AOE damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of targets, the cast of enemies in this section was pretty unremarkable outside in the beginning of the level, but got very interesting as we got deeper into the zone. Some bitey wolves and grabby zombies were run of the mill, but standouts like some very angry kangaroos and an ergo-plagued elephant with a Resident Evil-style surprise really wowed me. I spent so much time against the latter that I only just made it to the end of the level to see the boss: an enormous crocodile twisted by ergo.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On that note, bosses will get a new focus in the patch for the base game that will accompany Overture with two new game modes: Battle Memories and Death March. Death March is a straight up boss rush, allowing you to make a playlist of at least 3 bosses and attempt to take them down all in one go. Battle Memories, meanwhile, allows you to return to old boss fights and attempt to beat them again, now in up to five different tiers of difficulty, with each tier increasing some unique stats that these bosses gain in this mode. Rewards for conquering these tiers have been hinted at, but not elaborated on. I went back to one of the old bosses, the Black Rabbit Brotherhood, to see how different it was on tier 3 than my memory of them in the base game. The way they beat me and my rusty fingers to death didn’t point out any real differences, but as with the rest of Lies of P, I'm sure teasing out the mystery comes with lots of experimentation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lies of P was one of the standout games of 2023, and among the best games in its action RPG subgenre not made by FromSoftware. Overture doesn’t play with the formula too much, but I found that the new ingredients it added, like the great new weapon types and fabulously freaky monsters, proved that there's never really too much of a good thing, even if it is largely the same thing.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Movie. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-goes-all-in-on-donkey-kong-redesign-seen-in-nintendo-switch-2-and-mario-kart-9-first-look">Donkey Kong redesign was here to stay</a>, per the character's appearances in Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and more. Love it or hate it, that's your business, but now Shigeru Miyamoto has finally told us why the great ape got a makeover in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Miyamoto spoke to IGN at the unveiling of Universal’s new Epic Universe theme park in Orlando, Florida, which brings the new Donkey Kong Country expansion to the U.S. for the first time. In our interview, which you can read in full here, we asked Miyamoto about the new design, and what it was like seeing Donkey Kong "grow up" alongside Miyamoto's career at Nintendo. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's his response in full:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So when it comes to character creation and working with characters, I still take an active role in that. And looking back to the first generation Donkey Kong Country, we worked with Rare to create Donkey Kong Country.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What can we do with the design to make it more expressive?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we were talking about trying to create new versions, evolving Donkey Kong, we created the game called Jungle Beat. We worked together with the team that made 3D Mario. With the technology that was available at the time, we were able to make Donkey Kong more expressive. And going back to the design that Rare came up with, we reevaluated; what can we do with the design to make it more expressive? And then when it comes to the movie, we decided to move forward with this new generation Donkey Kong design."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 - Donkey Kong Bananza</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More expressive, huh? It certainly seems like Nintendo has nailed that. Fans have pointed out across social media that the new Donkey Kong is relatively similar to the old one, but has a sillier, more over-the-top look and expressiveness to him that the old design didn't quite capture. And it looks like we may see more Kong redesigns in the future to accompany him, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-redesigning-donkey-kong-nintendo-has-tweaked-another-classic-character-and-heres-our-best-look-yet">Diddy Kong already got a very light redesign</a> (he has teeth now???) as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-shigeru-miyamoto-interview-i-see-nintendo-as-like-a-talent-agency-and-we-have-within-our-roster-a-lot-of-talented-characters">full interview with Miyamoto at Universal right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

As early as 2020, Mario Kart World's developers say they had a rough idea of Nintendo's Switch 2 tech specs — and so began discussing a delay for the project onto Nintendo's next-gen machine.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking as part of a revealing <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-1/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ask the Developer</a> interview, Nintendo's Mario Kart World team said they had approached the concept of incorporating open-world gameplay and 24-player multiplayer "from a calm and collected programming perspective" to see whether it would be possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the team soon decided it would not. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was difficult for us to incorporate everything we wanted, so we were always conscious of what we were giving up in return," said Mario Kart World programming director Kenta Sato. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We discussed things like toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and we even considered dropping the framerate to 30 fps in some cases. It was a tough situation."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While confident in the concept, Mario Kart World's team continued attempting to make it work, but felt they were "kicking the can down the road," according to producer Kosuke Yabuki.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Kart World Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We knew it was going to get messy," Yabuki continued. "But as we'd decided to release Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's Booster Course Pass, we thought that would give us a bit more time to continue development. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's when the conversation of moving it to the Nintendo Switch 2 system came up, and this suddenly opened up a bunch of possibilities on what we could do. It was truly a ray of hope."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was "around 2020," the interview reveals, when Nintendo developers had "an idea of the next system [Switch 2]'s expected specs" but before working development units were available. So, the Mario Kart World team continued on, using estimates of the Switch 2 power they'd be able to play with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If we had included everything we wanted to in this game's vast world, then it wouldn't have run at 60 fps and would have suffered from constant framerate drops," Sato said. "I think there were a lot of people on the team who were worried about whether we could really manage it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But once we decided to release this game on Switch 2, we expected our worries to evaporate all at once," he continued. "I remember being overjoyed when I discovered we could express even more than we'd originally set out to."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
