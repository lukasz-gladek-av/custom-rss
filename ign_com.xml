Recently, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1igzcw4/marvel_rivals_leak_reveals_possible_pve_boss/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors have spread of a potential PvE boss fight</a>, leading some to speculate that a PvE mode is right around the corner. Unfortunately, NetEase recently clarified that it doesn't have plans for such a mode...yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke to Marvel Rivals producer Weicong Wu at the DICE Summit in Las Vegas this week, and asked him about any plans for a PvE mode. This was his response:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For now we don't have any kind of a PvE plan, but our development team is continuously experimenting with new game play modes. So if we found that a new specific game mode is entertaining enough, fun enough, we would of course bring it to our audience."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After he said this, Marvel Games executive producer Danny Koo hopped in to ask if I wanted a PvE mode in Marvel Rivals, and I told him I did. Wu continued:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah, we believe there are some of our audience that would like the PvE mode. But also, you can see that if we come up with a hardcore PvE experience, that will be totally a different distinctive experience from what we have right now. So our development team has been continuously experimenting with different approaches to achieve that goal, maybe a lighter mode, in a lighter sense of that, and to see what would work best for our game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So for now, it sounds like there are no concrete plans for PvE, but Wu does seem to be suggesting that NetEase is playing around with ideas for a "lighter" game mode of some kind, perhaps like a one-off event or something similar. For now, NetEase isn't saying much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals is still being updated every month and a half with new characters, with the Human Torch and The Thing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-sets-february-release-date-for-the-thing-and-human-torch">set to be the latest heroes joining the game</a> on February 21. We also spoke to Wu and Koo about the possibility of a Nintendo Switch 2 release for Marvel Rivals, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-developer-is-open-to-potential-future-release-on-nintendo-switch-2">which you can read about here</a>, and we also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-says-theyre-not-trolling-dataminers-wed-rather-spend-our-time-developing-the-game">confronted them about whether or not they were trolling dataminers</a> with fake hero "leaks" in the code.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-says-theyre-not-trolling-dataminers-wed-rather-spend-our-time-developing-the-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"It was like someone doing scratch paperwork left a notebook there, and someone decided to open it with no context."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals dataminers think the developers are trolling them with lists of potential future characters hidden in the game's code. But NetEase and Marvel say they have better things to do...like actually make the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, dataminers began sharing names of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-fear-netease-is-planting-fake-hero-leaks-to-throw-off-dataminers-but-whats-really-going-on">potential future heroes hidden in the code of Marvel Rivals</a>, a few of whom seemed to be confirmed pretty quickly as real when the Fantastic Four were officially announced. However, as the list of datamined heroes grew, a different rumor began to circulate in the community: some of the names were fake, planted there by developers to mislead dataminers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even now, there's disagreement in the community as to which, if any of the datamined characters are really being seriously considered for the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We recently had the opportunity to directly ask Marvel Rivals producer Weicong Wu and Marvel Games executive producer Danny Koo if they're secretly performing an elaborate troll. And while it sounds like there are no pranks being pulled here, we should still take all the names being found in the code with a grain of salt. Here's what Wu had to say:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So firstly we want to say that we don't recommend anybody to make adjustments to the files [of the game]," he began. "Also, you can see that for each character's design actually we come through a very complicated process and we make a lot of concepts, trials, prototypes, development, et cetera. So there could be some information left in the code, and it might mean that we have tried those directions and they may appear or may not appear in our future plans. And whether or not they will appear in our future pipeline is highly depending on what kind of gameplay experience our players would expect in our game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Koo added, "If I could have a ten-year plan, it'd be great. But the team experimented with a lot of play styles, heroes. It was like there's someone doing scratch paperwork and then just left a notebook there, and someone [a dataminer] decided to open it with no context."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I pushed a little, asking them point-blank if they were deliberately trolling people. Koo replied, "No. We would rather spend our time developing the actual game."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same conversation, we also discussed how a character gets chosen to be added into Marvel Rivals in the first place. The two told me that the team plans updates roughly a year in advance, and is committed to keeping its current pace of adding new characters every month and a half. For each update, NetEase first looks at what type of character and skillset is needed to balance out the rest of the game and add variety to the roster, and come up with a list of several different possible additions. Wu told me that part of NetEase's strategy for achieving game balance is to focus less on aggressively tweaking existing characters to be perfectly fine-tuned, and more on adding new characters and experiences to keep things fresh, fill gaps, support characters that are a bit weak with new team abilities, or counter characters that might be a little too strong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once they have a list of possibilities, NetEase then takes these suggestions to Marvel Games, and begin working on initial designs. From there, they look at what the community is currently excited about, as well as what's planned a year in advance in other Marvel divisions, such as if a big film or comic arc is coming that they can tie a character in with. That helps them come to a final decision on who's going in. All this explains why there might be a lot of different heroes listed in the code - NetEase just has a lot of ideas it's tossing around all the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review">great at launch</a>, and each new character only seems to make it more powerful, with the Human Torch and The Thing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-sets-february-release-date-for-the-thing-and-human-torch">set to be the latest heroes joining the game</a> on February 21. We also spoke to Wu and Koo about the possibility of a Nintendo Switch 2 release for Marvel Rivals, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-developer-is-open-to-potential-future-release-on-nintendo-switch-2">which you can read about here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

But its developer NetEase has been firm <a href="https://www.pockettactics.com/marvel-rivals/mobile" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that it's not coming to Nintendo Switch,</a> leaving Nintendo players out of luck on joining in the fun. But what about the Nintendo Switch 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We had the opportunity to pose this question to Marvel Rivals producer Weicong Wu this past week at the DICE Summit in Las Vegas. And fortunately for Switch fans, it sounds like a Switch 2 release is a real possibility. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Wu put it: "We're already in contact with Nintendo and working on some development kits. And whenever we find that we could provide great performance for our game on Switch 2, we're open to that. The reason why we didn't launch it onto the Switch, it was the first generation of that device they cannot provide a great experience for our gameplay. So if it could achieve that goal, we're open to that."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name">finally officially announced just last month</a>. While we don't have too many details on its capabilities just yet, it appears to be a bigger and more powerful Nintendo Switch system. Notably, it looks like the console will have some sort of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-mouse-theory-is-looking-pretty-good-right-about-now">mouse-like controller functionality</a> that could potentially make playing shooters like Marvel Rivals a bit more PC-like, though it still remains to be seen exactly how this will work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 doesn't have a release date currently, but a Nintendo Direct has been confirmed for April 2. Marvel Rivals, meanwhile, is out now on other platforms, and we like it a lot. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review">our 8/10 review</a>, we said that it "may be following closely in the slipstream of the hero shooters that have come before it, but by doing so Marvel Rivals has firmly placed itself in a strong position to take the crown for itself." The Human Torch and The Thing are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-sets-february-release-date-for-the-thing-and-human-torch">set to be the latest heroes joining the game</a> on February 21.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-creator-neil-druckmann-says-he-never-plans-for-sequels-that-requires-a-level-of-confidence-i-dont-have<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week at the DICE Summit in Las Vegas, Nevada, Naughty Dog head Neil Druckmann and Sony Santa Monica head Cory Barlog sat down in front of an audience for a chat about a very personal topic: doubt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two bantered back and forth for roughly an hour on a series of subjects that were clearly very close to both of them, ranging from their own doubts about themselves as creators to how they knew an idea was “right” or not. The two also answered a few pre-submitted audience questions, including one that Barlog read to Druckmann about sequels: “How do you and your teams approach character development over multiple games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Druckmann’s answer, though, was surprising for someone who’s made quite a few sequels in his day: he doesn’t think about multiple games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's a very easy question for me to answer, because I never think about multiple games, because I'm the game in front of us is so all consuming,” he responded. “I think you're jinxing yourself if you're starting to think about the sequel when you're working on the first game. So when I was making The Last of Us 2, yeah, sure. Every once in a while an idea pops in your head of where it might go if we get the chance to do another one. But I just approach it as, ‘what if I never get to do another one?’...I'm not saving some idea for the future. If there's a cool idea, I'm doing my best to get it into here.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ten-year payoffs</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Druckmann went on to explain that this is how he approaches everything, with perhaps the exception of the The Last of Us TV show since he already knows it’s going to have multiple seasons. So when sequels come around, instead of having a plan already in mind, Druckmann says he looks back on what he’s already done and asks himself what elements are unresolved and where the characters can go. “And if I feel like the answer is, they can't go anywhere, then I go, ‘I think we'll just kill them off.’</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/14/gettyimages-2172932657-1739566989717.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Neil Druckmann. Image credit: Jon Kopaloff/Variety via Getty Images</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm half joking, but we just find the next game. When we made Uncharted 1, we had no idea we would do the train sequence of Uncharted 2, or where Nathan Drake would be. We figured it out when we made Uncharted 2. And eventually, the same when we worked on Uncharted 3, same when we worked on Uncharted 4, where we look back and say, "How do we not repeat ourselves? Where else could this character go? What else could get him back into the adventure?" And we have to come up with a new answer. And if we don't have a new answer then we should ask ourselves, is this the right character? Is this the right game for us to work on? Or is it time to find something new?”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When we made Uncharted 1, we had no idea we would do the train sequence of Uncharted 2.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Barlog responded, saying he doesn’t work that way at all. Barlog says he has “way too much of the Charlie Day crazy conspiracy board of trying to connect and plan with all of these pieces,” and especially likes when he’s able to connect something he’s working on now with something he planned ten years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's just so magical, but it is absolutely, unequivocally the most unhealthy thing ever, because it is insanely stressful to try to fold and connect each of these pieces,” Barlog continued. “Because give or take five years, there's hundreds of people involved, and then a whole new group of people often are moved in on the next project. That's a bunch of different, and perspectives, and likes and dislikes that are going to negatively impact you setting something up that early. And they're going to be like, ‘Let's talk about this, because that was kind of the dumb. I don't know if I want to do that.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think for me that requires a level of confidence I just don't have,” Druckmann later responded. “Like this is going to be so successful, I know where this is going next. I'm like, I just want to focus on the next five days in front of me, let alone 10 years down the line.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The reason to wake up</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The fireside chat spanned a number of topics, with Druckmann and Barlog discussing their own experiences with doubt, and their respective creative processes for determining when an idea is “correct.” Later in the talk, they alluded to their feelings on their careers as they currently stand. Druckmann spoke on how he doesn’t want to go into TV or movies permanently, sharing this anecdote about his love for games:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since we're talking about TV, one time I gave some direction on Pedro Pascal. And I think he was frustrated by my direction, but he said it jokingly. He's like, ‘Do you like art?’ And I said, defensively, ‘Yeah, do you like art?’ And without missing a beat, he goes, ‘It's the reason to wake up in the morning. It's why I live and breathe.’ And to me, that's why we do it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“...At times, I've had panic attacks. It's just so much stress, but you do it, because you love it so much. I love games so much. I love the stories we tell in games so much. It's the reason to wake up in the morning. It's why we do what we do, and despite all the negatives that come with it, sometimes the death threats and all the negativity and all those things, you just kind of dismiss those things and say, ‘Yeah, but I get to make games with the most talented people. How lucky are we?’”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/14/gettyimages-1968417204-1739567114001.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Cory Barlog. Image credit: Hannah Taylor/BAFTA via Getty Images</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Druckmann then turned a question on Barlog, pointing out Barlog’s storied career in light of the recent retirement of his colleague Ted Price. “When is it enough?...When is this compulsion enough? When have you proven yourself enough?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barlog gave a lengthy answer that got <em>real </em>real:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Is it ever enough? The short answer's, no, it's never enough. It is the voice in your head driving you more, and more, and more, and more…You struggle, you struggle, you work, you work. And it feels thankless, and you're not being heard. Or the thing you're doing doesn't resonate. Then you reach that point where this mountain you've been looking at it, you've been dreaming about, you've been aspiring to. Finally, you reach the summit of this mountain. And it's like the most amazing and horrible thing all at the exact same time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Is it ever enough? The short answer's, no, it's never enough.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because when you get to the top, this demon of obsession inside of your head doesn't shut up and let you appreciate the moment, the smell of the air, the sound of this sort of successful silence, that you've persevered, you've struggled, you've worked so hard to get all this. And so many people came together, and used this collective creative brain space to give birth to something that was only an idea, or a concept. And just enjoy, and revel, and see that you accomplished this thing, and you are at the top of the mountain. No. The demon just looks and goes, ‘There's another mountain over there that's a lot taller.’ Okay, well what next? You don't even often take that time. And I don't want to believe that it is intentional. It is this weird, I think silent, not so silent part of your individual makeup. The reason you're in this is because you can't stop. You're driving yourself forward, and to your detriment, to everyone else giving you the advice to stop, and pace, and you don't.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Druckmann echoed this sentiment, but softer, ending on an anecdote about Naughty Dog’s Jason Rubin. Upon his departure from the company, Druckmann remembers Rubin telling him that him leaving would create a space for everyone else to rise up behind him. “I think about those opportunities. Eventually when I am done doing this, it will create a bunch of opportunities for people. So for me, it's like I'm slowly rising up. I'm getting less involved on the day-to-day stuff, like on this project that I'm on…And eventually I think I'll just be able to remove myself. I don't know how long that will take, but I think about it. And I think about the opportunities I will create for next people to take on this stress, and take on their ideas, and be vulnerable and do all those things.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barlog quipped back, concluding the talk: “Very convincing. I’m going to retire.”
