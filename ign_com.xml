Jayson Rothwell will write the screenplay, although there are no plot details yet. Nor is there a release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the Sega side, Toru Nakahara, who worked on the Sonic movies, is a producer, and Sega America and Europe CEO Shuji Utsumi will oversee the film.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">OutRun began life in 1986 as a graphically impressive arcade driving game designed by Sega developer legend Yu Suzuki. It’s seen numerous versions and ports over the years, with a proper sequel released in 2003, but has been somewhat dormant in recent times. The most recent release came in 2009 with Sumo Digital's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/outrun-online-arcade">OutRun Online Arcade</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega, however, has dipped into its back catalogue for inspiration, with new Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, Golden Axe, Virtua Fighter, and Shinobi games all in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has also pushed adaptations of its coveted IP. The Sonic movies are of course hugely popular, and an adaptation of Like a Dragon: Yakuza launched last year on Amazon. Hollywood is keen for more video game films, with The Super Mario Bros. Movie and the recently released A Minecraft Movie breaking records.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what sort of film OutRun will be, perhaps Bay and Sweeney invisage a Fast &amp; Furious-style driving and action flick.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The series is best known for its deep narratives, excellent turn-based combat, and beloved characters. However, it's hard not to argue that the Persona franchise has grown as much as it has thanks to its music. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to purchasing video game soundtracks, what better way to enjoy them than on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-bluetooth-record-players">vinyl</a>? Many of the Persona soundtracks were quite hard to obtain on vinyl previously, whether due to high prices or limited availability. Now, however, iam8bit and Atlus have teamed up once more to create brand-new, moderately priced releases that you can now pre-order at IGN Store.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Check Out The Persona Vinyl Collection at IGN Store!</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">First up, you can pre-order the entire <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review">Persona 3 Reload</a> soundtrack on Vinyl with the 4xLP release, featuring Holographic Broken Glass Vinyl.
