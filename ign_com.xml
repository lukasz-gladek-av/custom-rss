Here’s what we have this week, courtesy of data from TCGPlayer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Loads of Energy</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/12/energy-chamber-1755005421807.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><div catalogid="cb6d924f-1950-4986-a366-5b704bdf35d2" id="226689"><div id="226689" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Energy Chamber</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you saw this coming, you might want to buy a lottery ticket, because <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKg0VV?object_uuid=be3e6e11-2de2-40bf-b7ad-92a46d21fcd6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Energy Chamber</u></a> has seen a significant price jump despite being a card that debuted 21 years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was available for a few cents, but foil versions have climbed up to almost $12. It remains to be seen if that’ll hold, but the increased value is due to its ability to generate counters in the upkeep step. That’s an ideal inclusion for the new Counter Intelligence precon, or the Final Fantasy Counter Blitz precon.</p></div><div catalogid="cb6d924f-1950-4986-a366-5b704bdf35d2" id="226690"><div id="226690" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Ragost, Deft Gastronaut</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7mmY?object_uuid=be3e6e11-2de2-40bf-b7ad-92a46d21fcd6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Ragost, Deft Gastronaut</u></a> is sticking around, now at around $15.

Chief among them are Collector Boosters and Collector Editions of Commander Decks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s how you can find them.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Happened To Magic: The Gathering x Final Fantasy Collector Boosters?</h2><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRRN6?object_uuid=f533bc8e-6d03-4156-8bd4-86a48fabeb91&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FINAL FANTASY - Collector Booster Pack<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbbGb?object_uuid=f533bc8e-6d03-4156-8bd4-86a48fabeb91&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Collector Booster Box<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Collector Boosters offer 15 cards, including 5–6 cards of rarity Rare or higher and 3 - 6 Uncommon, 3 - 5 Common, and 1 Full-Art Land card, with a total of 8 - 12 Traditional Foil cards and 0 - 3 cards with a special foil treatment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-most-expensive-cards-2025"><u>chase cards are most commonly found in Collector Boosters</u></a> has meant they sell out quickly, and now command a high price on the secondary market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Play Boosters are likely to be reprinted regularly, Collector Booster packs are going for as much as $149.99 - for <em>fifteen</em> cards.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What About Collector Commander Decks?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Commander Decks will likely see reprints, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-precons-discounted-amazon"><u>and they’re already slipping below MSRP</u></a>, but the Collector’s Editions are a “one and done” kind of deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth stressing that these don’t offer any additional cards you won’t find in the standard versions, but give every single card a foil treatment. The price for that privelege is $159.99 and up, with the Final Fantasy 7 deck closer to $500 - yikes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">But Wait!</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Believe it or not, you don’t have to sell your house to buy Magic cards. There are a whole host of more affordable, but still awesome, cards you can find on the secondary market for a few dollars each.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even some of the full-art, borderless cards are available if you know what to look for, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-most-affordable-cards"><u>we’ve got a handy list</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.
