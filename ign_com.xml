Eight players build teams and fight to be the last person standing, with their units automatically battling after being placed strategically on the game board between rounds. Riot describes TFT as “the world’s largest PC strategy game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TFT is traditionally a PvP game, but Ao Shin’s Ascent, due out September 24, is its first-ever progression-focused PvE mode. Players take on escalating PvE battles and bosses, with roguelite progression that grants permanent power in the mode’s Journey Track.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>⛰️Get ready to climb! ⛰️<br>Ao Shin’s Ascent is a timerless PvE mode with permanent power progression &amp; the all-new Guide mechanic.</p><p>Climb the mountain, save corrupted Little Legends, and push to the summit! </p><p>Launches Sept 24 for a limited time. <a href="https://t.co/489UvyRvO3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/489UvyRvO3</a></p></div>— Teamfight Tactics (@TFT) <a href="https://twitter.com/TFT/status/1964331517833781697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official info, from developer Riot Games:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>SUMMIT THE MOUNTAIN:</strong> Climb the mountain while strengthening your board, arming yourself with powerful Augments, and preparing for an ultra-powerful Boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>CRAFT YOUR PATH AND CHALLENGE:</strong> Select your difficulty, your Guide, the Boss you’ll fight, and more to make every run feel and play differently! </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>KEY MECHANIC; GUIDES:</strong> The odds aren’t stacked in your favor at the start — recruiting a selection of unlockable Guides can help turn the tides by giving you access to novel strategies and power!

This progression-based mode is our most ambitious PvE experiment yet, building on the strong global player engagement we’ve seen with Set 15, K.O. Coliseum. It marks a major step toward giving TFT players more ways to play, more ways to test themselves, and more reasons to return for the next climb.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s a comment from Michael “Skip” Scipione, Senior Game Designer for Teamfight Tactics: “With Ao Shin’s Ascent, we wanted to push TFT forward with bold new mechanics that expand on its core gameplay. Bosses evolve with shifting modifiers, and the new progression system means each run builds toward the next, letting players experiment with different approaches against an ever-changing challenge. It’s a way to expand TFT’s core mechanics while giving players new stories to create with every climb.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Teamfight Tactics: Ao Shin’s Ascent launches on September 24 at 10am Pacific Time, shortly after the release of patch 15.5. The mode will be available until the end of patch 15.6 on October 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Director Tetsuya Nomura has heard the cries for updates on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iv"><u>Kingdom Hearts 4</u></a>, and he’s happy to report that development is “progressing really smoothly.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a largely inconsequential but still welcome update for two of Square Enix’s most anticipated games that arrived during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeOWfNAuVUk&amp;t=6796s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the recent Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis second anniversary broadcast</u></a>. As reported on and translated by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-three-and-kingdom-hearts-iv-development-progressing-smoothly-tetsuya-nomura-confirms" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Gematsu</u></a>, Nomura took the opportunity to address waves of comments from fans hoping to see the team make an announcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Apparently, [co-director Motomu] Toriyama mentioned in an interview that something might be released around the second anniversary [of <em>Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis</em>],” Nomura said when addressing comments specifically related to the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series. “So that’s probably where those expectations are coming from. Right, so things are progressing really smoothly. I can’t really say more — if I suddenly went, ‘Well, actually...,’ everyone would be really surprised! [Laughs.]”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nomura goes as far as to say that the “release timing has already been decided” but stops short of clarifying when exactly Square Enix will share more. For now, he asks fans to be patient, adding that work on Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 is “moving forward according to that schedule.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RPG fans have been on the hunt for news about the next entry in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series since its last installment, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a>, launched in early 2024. We know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-in-development"><u>development started as early as June 2022</u></a>, with Square Enix saying last year that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-hoping-to-release-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-finale-by-2027"><u>its goal is to see it launch by 2027</u></a>. Excitement for the third and final chapter in the trilogy grew even more when the team revealed that it had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-a-completed-story-at-square-enix"><u>completed its story earlier this year</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Development for Kingdom Hearts 4, meanwhile, is progressing in a similarly positive direction, though Nomura says even less about when any further updates may arrive on this front.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And this has also come up in the comments here and there,” Nomura added, “but <em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em> is likewise steadily moving forward according to schedule, so please look forward to it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingdom Hearts 4 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-and-kingdom-hearts-missing-link-announced-at-the-series-20th-anniversary-event"><u>announced in 2022</u></a>, and updates have been distressingly few and far between since. It wasn’t until May 2025, not even four months ago, that Square Enix was willing to share a substantial update, and even then, all fans had to hold onto was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-finally-breaks-silence-on-kingdom-hearts-4-shares-screenshots-says-its-dedicated-to-making-this-an-experience-that-lives-up-to-your-expectations"><u>a handful of new screenshots</u></a> and <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1922819231965696436" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a short message from the team</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Hearts 4 Screenshots May 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve seen how excited you are, and we are truly grateful from the bottom of our hearts," Square Enix said at the time. “We are equally excited and can’t wait to share more about Kingdom Hearts IV when the time is right. Until then, we appreciate your patience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no telling when exactly we can expect to hear any additional updates on Kingdom Hearts 4 or Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3. In the meantime, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-release-date-gameplay-trailer-news"><u>everything we know about the former here</u></a>.

Players who picked up their copies upon the launch of Fallout 76 in late 2018, however, were surprised when the package included a cheap, <em>nylon</em> bag instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It led to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/03/fallout-76s-200-power-armor-edition-shipped-with-bag-of-cheaper-quality-than-promised"><u>quite the uproar from the Fallout community</u></a>, which wasn’t enthusiastic about the idea that Bethesda may have pulled a fast one on the group of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/08/27/fallout-76-power-armor-edition-sells-out-bethesda-says-more-wont-be-made"><u>dedicated fans who paid $200 for the special release</u></a> with only a small amount of in-game currency to show for it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">To heck with this guy in particular.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're merrily strolling your way through Hollow Knight: Silksong right now, not a care in the world, you may want to brace yourself. Because aside from Silksong's usual slate of super-tough bosses that'll have you corpse running over and over again, there's one very early miniboss enemy that's causing a lot of players a whole heap of trouble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Warning: Very minor spoilers for an early-game miniboss in The Marrow appear below. Don't read on if you don't want to know anything about any of the game's enemies.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The miniboss in question is considered so minor by the game that it doesn't appear with a name on-screen, making it tough to Google a guide when you get stuck on him. But his name is Skarrgard, and he's a bulky red bug enemy wielding a big piece of bone as a weapon. You can find him waiting in a cave on the east side of The Marrow, just above the prison.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Skarrgard seems inocuous when you first approach him, just like a slightly tougher regular enemy. But this guy really has some folks on tilt. He's got three attacks: one where he disappears underground and pops up for an attack, a jump attack, and one where he swings his bone around. He's got some real range on that bone weapon, and because the tunnel is so tiny, most of his moves are very hard, if not impossible, to jump over. What's more, his attacks hit for <em>two whole masks of damage</em> rather than just one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two ways to beat Skarrgard, the easy way and the hard way. The hard way is to keep practicing and eventually defeat him (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/How_to_Defeat_the_Skull_Ant_Miniboss_Early">see our red axe ant mini boss thing strategy guide for exactly how to do beat him early</a>). You can lure him down the narrow tunnel a bit so he can't do his jump attack more, and if you run past him whenever he goes underground, you can sort of bounce him back and forth in the center of the room, taking careful swings, and eventually bring him down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I recommend the easy way, which is to come back later. You'll eventually get a dash ability that makes it <em>much</em> easier to avoid his hits, and it seems like you're meant to have that ability before challenging Skarrgard for real. Even if you're tempted by a juicy reward for killing him early, maybe don't bother? The reward for fighting him is that it unlocks access to a new area, and if you're fighting him early you probably have plenty else to explore that isn't hidden behind a giant, bone-swinging bug man.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Either way, good luck with this guy. For many, he's significantly tougher than any of Silksong's early actual bosses, so don't feel discouraged if you die to him a lot before you finally score a win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight: Silksong is out now, and we're <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong">hard at work on our Wiki guides</a> of everything you might possibly want to know as you start your adventures in Pharloom. We've also got a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-review">review-in-progress covering our thoughts so far</a> that we'll update with a score as soon as we've finished the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

You can't buy a product anymore,” Hines said. “When you talk about a subscription that relies on content, if you don't figure out how to balance the needs of the service and the people running the service with the people who are providing the content – without which your subscription is worth jack s*** – then you have a real problem.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That tension is hurting a lot of people, including the content creators themselves, because they're fitting into an ecosystem that is not properly valuing and rewarding what they're making.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Gamers have discussed the viability of platforms like Game Pass since its launch in 2017. While a service flooded with hundreds of games for subscribers to play sounds like a dream come true for players, how the developers behind these games receive support has been hazy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Game Pass <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-history-subscription-service"><u>pushed forward into the early 2020s</u></a> and PlayStation eventually established its own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-plus-ps-now-spartacus-subscription-tiers-price-ps3-xbox-game-pass-release-date"><u>PlayStation Plus-centered competitor</u></a>, more question marks popped up.

Today, Hines adds that the pressure of an ongoing gaming subscription service is affecting the very developers it needs to exist in the first place. It’s a reliance on this model that he feels is “hurting a lot of people.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You need to properly acknowledge, compensate and recognize what it takes to create that content and not just make a game, but make a product,” he elaborated. “That tension is hurting a lot of people, including the content creators themselves, because they're fitting into an ecosystem that is not properly valuing and rewarding what they're making.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two Bethesda studios – Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks – were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda"><u>shut down in May 2024</u></a>, though the latter was eventually <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-ip-and-tango-gameworks-acquired-by-krafton-from-xbox-studio-will-no-longer-be-shut-down"><u>saved after PUBG publisher Krafton acquired it from Xbox</u></a>.
