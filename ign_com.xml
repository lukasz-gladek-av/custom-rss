But according to Microsoft’s gaming chief Phil Spencer, there are no “red lines” in its first-party lineup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has so-far used older games released over a year ago for its multiplatform push as opposed to brand new games, but that will soon change with the release of Indiana Jones. Microsoft will launch MachineGames' hotly anticipated Xbox game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-finally-gets-a-release-date-for-xbox-and-playstation-gamescom-2024"><u>on PS5</u></a> just a few months after it launches on Xbox and PC this December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the latest first-party Xbox game to make the jump to a rival console, following the release of Obsidian’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pentiment"><u>Pentiment</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grounded"><u>Grounded</u></a>, Tango Gameworks’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hi-fi-rush"><u>Hi-Fi Rush</u></a>, and Rare’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sea-of-thieves"><u>Sea of Thieves</u></a> earlier in 2024. In June, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-confirmed-for-ps5-xbox-games-showcase-2024"><u>Microsoft announced Id Software's upcoming Doom: The Dark Ages will also launch on PS5</u></a> next year.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/13/gettyimages-2183768916-1731502030266.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer. Photo by Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer has said Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business — with the pressure now on to deliver following its eye-watering $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We run a business,” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5">Spencer said in August</a>. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s pretty clear at this point that Xbox console exclusives are no longer a priority for Microsoft’s gaming business, but are there some Xbox games that are considered so sacred that they will never launch on PlayStation?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer said every Xbox game is up for grabs when it comes to making the multiplatform jump. “I do not see sort of red lines in our portfolio that say ‘thou must not,’” he said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo on PlayStation would perhaps be the biggest Xbox game to go multiplatform so far, given its association with the console over the years. Last month, tech experts said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-halo-games-moving-to-unreal-engine-as-developer-343-industries-officially-changes-its-name"><u>Halo’s move to Unreal Engine 5</u></a> would make it easier for developer Halo Studios, née 343 Industries, to take Xbox’s flagship first-person shooter multi-platform, including a launch on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s too early to make any sort of decision on the next version of Halo, Bloomberg quoted Spencer as saying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As former Xbox boss Peter Moore recently told IGN, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore"><u>Microsoft will be debating whether to bring Halo to PlayStation as we speak</u></a>. Perhaps a multiplatform release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> or even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-infinite">Halo: Infinite</a> would be more likely in the short term, with Microsoft yet to indicate when the next Halo game will come out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Victor J.

The high graphics preset is what GSC calls recommended, and provides 60fps gameplay at 1440p.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For that high graphics preset, you’ll need a Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti / RTX 4070 or AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT GPU and 32GB of RAM. Low and medium require 16GB of RAM and less powerful GPUs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All graphics presets, however, require 160GB of SSD storage, which is a significant footprint worth bearing in mind if you’re planning on playing.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/13/gcm7s-wweaerrys-1731500123682.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Stalker 2's PC system requirements.

The Pokémon Company refused to give a clear answer.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/13/img-5221-1731499315556.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon TCG Pocket's Booster Pack Carousel. Image credit: IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"While Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket draws inspiration from the experience of opening physical Pokémon TCG booster packs, we are unable to share specifics at this time," it said vaguely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But some players claim to already have hard proof that the choice in Pokémon TCG Pocket is all an illusion, with the Wonder Pick system being at the heart of such evidence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This additional method of obtaining cards lets players pick one of five cards at random, with the choices coming directly from another player's pack. If a player opens one containing a Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Charizard ex</a>, and Blane, for example, there's a chance a friend of that player, or even a complete random, will see this pack in their Wonder Pick section.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They can then choose to open this pack and be presented with the Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard, Charizard ex, and Blane, but each card is flipped around and players pick just one at random.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kOx_xHGujN4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PokéNinaa</a> shared a clip of her opening a pack while a friend checked their Wonder Pick from her. The moment PokéNinaa selected Open a Pack, and was presented with the carousel of boosters presenting a choice, her Wonder Pick appeared on her friend's account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wonder Pick contained a pack PokéNinaa hadn't open previously, and contained Pyukumuku, Blitzle, Slowpoke, Kabutops, and Melmetal. She then picked a booster pack from her myriad options and was presented with Pyukumuku, Blitzle, Slowpoke, Kabutops, and Melmetal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oher players have shared the same findings with Wonder Picks, leading to a general belief among the Pokémon TCG Pocket community that pack choices don't actually matter. It certainly appears to be the case, especially with The Pokémon Company refusing to say anything to the contrary, but there's a chance this could be an unintended bug or similarly unintended mechanic that will disappear once the game grows older than a couple of weeks.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Genetic Apex</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived in October on iOS and Android as a digital version of the beloved trading card game.
