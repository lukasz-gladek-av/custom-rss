It’s unclear what other elements will return for Mega Man: Dual Override, with the footage mostly promising vibrant visuals and a promise to warp onto PC, Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox consoles in 2027.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Mega Man returns in 2027 with a brand-new entry in the classic action platforming series!" a description from Capcom says. "Override challenges and blast down legions of robots while springboarding across a new array of futuristic frontiers!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With its release date as much as two years away, it shouldn't come as a surprise to hear that we know little else about Mega Man Dual Override at the moment. However, Capcom is giving die-hard fans the chance learn more about what some are already calling Mega Man 12 with the introduction of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqfLH-9Jsj0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robot Master Design Contest</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The contest, which calls on fans to submit unique robot designs, will result in six winners, including one grand prize winner whose design will be turned into an enemy for Mega Man to fight.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Two and a half years after its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phantom-blade-0-announced-at-playstation-showcase">reveal at a PlayStation showcase</a>, Phantom Blade Zero now has a release date. It's September 9, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This news came alongside a brand new trailer for the game, which showed off more of the game's story and combat. We get a look at Phantom Blade's mysterious metal masked antagonist stealing a baby and doing some real flashy sword moves, followed by plenty of shots of the protagonist, seemingly a wanted man. He's got some pretty swanky moves himself, highlighting further how cool Phantom Blade's combat promises to be. There's also a young woman who gives the hero a good luck charm, then turns into a weird hollow monster or something. Lots going on here.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We've seen Phantom Blade a number of times since its original announcement, both in the form of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pc-and-ps5-action-rpg-phantom-blade-zero-gets-slick-trailer-but-still-no-release-date">trailers</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phantom-blade-zero-plays-more-like-ninja-gaiden-than-dark-souls">hands-on previews</a>. In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phantom-blade-zero-is-a-delightfully-punishing-action-rpg">most recent look at it this past October</a>, we found the game to be delightfully difficult, with our previewer saying, "It never felt cheap; it just demanded more from me. In just over an hour of play, I was easily ten times the player I was when I started. It’s a feeling of achievement that is reserved for the very best action games on the planet. If the rest is anything like what I played at TGS, I feel like there’s a real chance that Phantom Blade 0 might be one of those games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Phantom Blade Zero is a wuxia action RPG by Chinese studio S-Game that follows Soul, an assassin framed for a murder trying to uncover the truth of what happened. It's coming out in September for PC and PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at The Game Awards <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

And indeed, the game is set after the Empire's fall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Star Wars: Galactic Racer is a runs-based, high-stakes reinvention of racing born in the lawless Outer Rim of the Star Wars galaxy," an official blurb reads. "With the Empire gone and the galaxy rebuilding, The Galactic League is formed: an underground, unsanctioned circuit where syndicates bankroll chaos and champions are forged. "No Force. No prophecy. Just skill, strategy, and the will to rise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced tonight at The Game Awards 2025, the project will be published by Secret Mode, the newly-independent publisher that previously handled Still Wakes the Deep. As for a release date, we only know it's coming in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer of well-received top-down action game The Ascent has revealed its next game and a shift in perspective to first-person.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neon Giant announced No Law at The Game Awards 2025 with a trailer that showed the move to first-person and a distinct Cyberpunk style. Indeed, at first glance, No Law looks a bit like CD Projekt’s own Cyberpunk 2077, although there are key differences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Law is an open world first-person shooter role-playing game with immersive sim elements, due out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S published by PUBG company Krafton. A release window has yet to be announced.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s set in a cyber-noire called Port Desire, and sees the player assume the role of Grey Harker, an ex-military veteran who left his war-torn life behind for a much more peaceful existence tending his plants. Unfortunately for him, trouble comes knocking, and he must lean on his black ops instincts to survive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neon Giant said to expect a rich story drenched in neon, colorful characters, and big choices to make. If you play through multiple times you’ll find alternate paths and new outcomes. You can mix things up with gameplay, too, focusing on stealth or going in guns blazing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Law is a single-player only game, with no multiplayer, and it has nothing to do with The Ascent, Neon Giant insisted. This is a new fictional world, and from the trailer you can see it’s a more grounded cyberpunk aesthetic, compared to the more sci-fi, alien-packed world of The Ascent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

It's not a sequel per se, but it's clearly full of that game's DNA. It stars Rahul Kohli as Arjun Devraj, a man searching for answers on a strange, shifting planet. Creative director Gregory Louden called Saros the "ultimate evolution" of the Housemarque gameplay-first experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/returnal-follow-up-saros-lands-march-2026-ps5-release-date-alongside-first-look-at-gameplay">a bit more of Saros in September</a> at another State of Play, showing off new features such as "Second Chance" (essentially a free revive) and some of Arjun's weapons and capabilities, and more of Saros' setting, the hostile planet Carcosa.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/returnal-review">gave Returnal an 8/10 when it came out</a>, saying that "its roguelike runs are too long and it needs a way to save in the middle of them, but Returnal's third-person shooter action, clever story, and atmosphere are excellent."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at The Game Awards today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
