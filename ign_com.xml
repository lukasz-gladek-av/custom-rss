One of our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-reviewed-games-of-2024">favorite games of 2024</a>, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, got an astonishing price drop for PS5 during this year's sale that's still live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, the game is <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7bjPE?object_uuid=693fc74c-e685-4875-8efd-44dd98f9a4dd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0C7RP9T1G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">marked down to just $14.97</a>.

Writer Phil Hornshaw said, "Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown captures not only what made games such as The Sands of Time so good, but it irons out a lot of the little issues that plagued the 3D games in this series by opting for a 2D perspective – and owning it." He continues on to say it's, "a worthy successor to the best of the Prince of Persia legacy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has a few more game deals live that are worth taking advantage of.

The Xbox wireless controller in Carbon Black, Robot White, or Electric Volt is on sale for $34.99. Shock Blue, Pulse Red, and Deep Pink are on sale for $39.99. For any of these options, make sure you apply coupon code "<strong>BFCMXBOX</strong>" in your shopping cart. These controllers are compatible with Xbox Series X and S consoles as well as your PC.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Xbox Controllers Starting at $34.99</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Aesthetics aside, these Xbox wireless controllers are identical to the one that's bundled with the Xbox Series X and S console. Standard features include textured grips, hybrid D-pad, button mapping with the Xbox app, a 3.5mm audio jack that works with any wired headset, and a Share button to upload screenshots and video.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The controller supports both Xbox wireless and Bluetooth connectivity. That means you can use it for your PC or mobile device. In fact, we think this is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-controller">the best PC controller</a> you can get. If your PC doesn't have Bluetooth, you can still use it in wired mode with a USB Type-C cable or go out and buy a Bluetooth or <a href="https://zdcs.link/68q2q?object_uuid=83caf33c-4b36-4b8c-aae0-5ab740d4e479&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox wireless adapter</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Want Something More Unique?</h2><div catalogid="5fb1e184-2360-4acd-b4d4-15fc3dd712a5" id="212090"><div id="212090" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Xbox Wireless Controller</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want a color scheme that's sure to grab yours and other people's attentions, check out the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrprVG?object_uuid=83caf33c-4b36-4b8c-aae0-5ab740d4e479&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ghost Cipher Limited Edition</a> Xbox Series X|S wireless controller. It's down to $45 with free shipping at Amazon and Target. The Ghost Cipher Edition is an absolutely gorgeous controller, with a translucent clear top case, rubberized ash gray grips, metallic bronze triggers and D-pad, and a solid white back. The interior components are colored silver to match the overall theme.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Will the Deals Change for Cyber Monday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In my experience, many of the same deals we saw on Black Friday will return for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/cyber-monday">Cyber Monday 2024</a>, including deals that were sold out or expired. Retailers usually release their hottest selling items in batches so that every sale event has at least some inventory reserved. That said, I also expect plenty of new, never before seen deals. Traditionally, Black Friday was known as the "retail holiday," where the best deals were found in-store, and Cyber Monday was known as the "online holiday," where the best deals were online only. Although today the lines have blurred, it is still true that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">many online only retailers still consider Cyber Monday the sale event of the year instead of Black Friday</a>. Expect some amazing sales to come out of online-only sites like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, Lenovo and several online-only deals from traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. In fact, Amazon has taken the preemptive and already switched over to Cyber Monday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
