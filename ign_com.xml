            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> just got a big balance patch, and even if you're not someone who's great at parsing patch notes, you might want to tune into this one, because basically every character that's been widely regarded as terrible for months now got a big buff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 1.03.2 is simply billed as "Balance Adjustments and Feature Updates" but includes a very, very long list of Nightfarer, Relic, Equipment, Sorcery, Incantations, and other adjustments that should prove a major boon especially to a few Nightfarers that desperately needed some love: Raider, Guardian, Executor, and Revenant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've shared the patch notes below, but here's a quick summary for each of these four characters. Guardian, whose role is generally to "tank" bosses, guard hits, and keep enemy attention so their teammates can wail on them, got a buff to damage negation and to his Guard Boost ability. Raider, a big slow heavy attacker, has historically been a little<em> too </em>slow in attacking to be really viable, so he got a big boost to attack speed. Revenant, historically just weak all around if very fun to play, got a big attack power boost to her summoned spirits. And Executor, a speedy melee attacker who plays a bit like Wolf in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, got buffs to seemingly everything: damage, stamina, damage negation, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The community, especially those who like to main those four Nightfarers, are especially thrilled. Several of these guys, especially Raider and Revenant, have been struggling for a while now, and their weaknesses were becoming even more evident next to the two newly-added Nightfarers in the Forsaken Hollows DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those aren't the only changes, just the biggest character-related ones. There have been a ton of tweaks and bug fixes to everything from how many of certain items can be bought in shops to how much FP certain spells cost to cast. There were also, quietly, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1qdoatt/30_weapons_id_slots_added/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30 new weapon ID slots added to the game</a>, as someone has pointed out, though it's unclear what those are for or even if they'll ever be used. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightreign players are still going strong almost a year after the game first came out, with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-its-first-dlc-next-month">new DLC having dropped in December</a> adding a new map, two new Nightfarers, new bosses, and more.

Strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck (S.P.E.C.I.A.L).</blockquote><blockquote>The series will not only test dwellers’ core attributes, but also their loyalty and alliances. It’s a game of power dynamics, popularity and social strategy which will ultimately result in a huge cash prize, but do you have what it takes to be the most S.P.E.C.I.A.L?.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s produced by Studio Lambert, the company that’s also behind The Traitors and Squid Game: The Challenge.
