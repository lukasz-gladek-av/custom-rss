            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new island just came to Fortnite that features a digital reimagining of Qatar’s capital city, Doha, as well as Hamad International Airport and a Qatar Airways aircraft. Called QVerse Island, it’s meant to give travelers an immersive way to experience the sights of the city and its airport. There are lots of minigames, a glimpse at some of the city’s unique architecture, and a hidden golden ticket that you can find for a chance to win a free Qatar Airways flight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can reach QVerse Island within Fortnite by searching for “QVerse” or using code 6020-0265-6735. When you arrive on the island, you’ll pull up to Hamad International Airport and get a look at the skyline of Doha with re-creations of its real-life skyscrapers. You’ll be greeted by Sama, Qatar Airways’ digital cabin crew member, who will give you five quests to complete.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/qverse-island-5-1765238045451.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After you’ve talked to her, you’re free to explore the city and do things in whatever order you choose. Right off the bat, you’ll see floating coins that give you 10 gold each. You can spend that gold at the airport vending machines for things like faster running speed, a jetpack that lets you double jump, or consumable items. You can also look for a hidden door that takes you inside the Business Class cabin of a Qatar Airways aircraft, where you’ll join other Fortnite characters as passengers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you exit the airport and make your way to the street, you’ll see you can summon a car with one button press, making traversal of the city quick and easy. Your HUD will have icons for the island’s biggest attractions, which is also where you can complete the quests Sama gave you. These are some of real-life Qatar’s most recognizable landmarks, like the National Museum of Qatar, West Bay, Katara Towers, and The Pearl Island. And QVerse Island has a persistent day/night cycle, so you can watch the sunset around these locations and see the whole city light up at night.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/qverse-island-4-1765238079743.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Each location has a minigame associated with it. At the National Museum of Qatar, you’re given a scavenger hunt to find five lost artifacts that lie scattered around the city. At West Bay, you can use your summoned car to complete a time trial race. At Katara Towers, you’ll need to cross between the towers, high in the air, while a rotating bar tries to knock you off. And at The Pearl Island, you can take on a parkour obstacle course that runs across the rooftops of the city.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you’re exploring, you’ll notice a timer counting down to the next departure. Once the countdown finishes, you’ll be transported to a multiplayer minigame with other people currently on the island. There are four minigames in all: Wild Wheels Safari, Neon City Drop, Jumpus Maximus, and Home Run Rush. For all four, the last person standing wins.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/qverse-island-2-1765238121119.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Wild Wheels Safari, you drive cars around a desert arena while floor tiles gradually fall away. If you fall into a hole, you’re eliminated. Neon City Drop is a similar concept, but you’re on foot and the floor is made up of brightly colored panels that fall away over time. Jumpus Maximus puts you on a giant spinning wheel in the air while rotating bars of different heights try to knock you off. And Home Run Rush gives everyone a superpowered baseball bat that can launch other players out of the stadium.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In between all the fun and games, you can explore QVerse Island to find the golden ticket. You’ll get an on-screen alert letting you know in what area of the map it just spawned, and then it’s up to you to find it. It only stays in one place for a few minutes, so you need to hurry before it moves again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you find it, take a screenshot of your in-game character with it. Then post that photo to Instagram, Facebook, or X/Twitter with the hashtag #FlyWithQR, follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/qatarairways/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Qatar Airways on Instagram</a>, and you’ll be entered in a drawing. A winning entry will be randomly selected, and that person will win a Qatar Airways flight ticket. There will be a new drawing each week and the contest will run for 10 weeks. If you don’t win one week, you can try again the next.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/28/12398-fortnite-add-logos-to-images14-1769625524256.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">QVerse Island is available to explore now, and between February 7–20, gaming content creators around the world will join in on the fun, too. So be sure to check that out. Who knows who you’ll get to face off against in all those minigames? To keep up with the latest news and updates from Qatar Airways, you can follow them on Instagram, Facebook, or X/Twitter.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/new-fortnite-island-created-by-qatar-airways-gives-you-a-chance-to-win-weekly-flight-tickets]]></content:encoded>

"Wow, totally unexpected," <a href="https://x.com/dark1x/status/2019454335483036142" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> Digital Foundry veteran and game preservation fan John Linneman in response. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Late last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-dev-says-nintendo-has-cheaper-cartridges-coming-as-alternative-to-game-key-cards-then-backtracks-but-either-way-its-title-will-now-be-a-proper-physical-release">one Switch 2 developer initially suggested that Nintendo was preparing to make more sizes of Game Cartridge available</a> for manufacturers to ship titles on, rather than relying on Game-Key cards. However, the developer then scrubbed most of this information from the internet, and implied it was unable to announce anything that Nintendo itself had not confirmed officially. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda's other three titles getting physical launches on Switch 2 this year will not be on Game Cartridges, or even Game-Key cards. Instead, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> will all have physical editions that are "code-in-a-box," Bethesda has said. Of course, all of these games will be available via digital download too, via the Switch 2's eShop. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-switch-2-release-dates-leak-just-before-nintendo-direct">As announced (and leaked) earlier today</a>, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will launch digitally and physically on May 12. The game's DLC, The Order of Giants, will also be available download separately on that date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition launches digitally on February 24 and physically on April 28. Skyrim Anniversary Edition is available digitally already, and will come in a box on April 28. Finally, Oblivion Remastered has a vague "2026" launch window for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For much more, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-everything-announced-updating-live">everything else announced in today's Nintendo Partner Direct</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/mouse-pi-for-hire-inside-mouses-wild-cartoon-arsenal-ign-first</link>
            <guid>1427428</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Odds are, if Mouse: P.I. for Hire caught your eye, it's because of its unique, hand-drawn, black-and-white 1930s-era "rubber hose" animation style. But it's aiming to be a lot more than just a pretty face. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mouse-pi-for-hire-might-fill-the-animated-void-cuphead-left-behind">We played Mouse last year</a> – and we'll be doing so again as part of this month's exclusive IGN First coverage – but today we're taking a deeper dive into its wild cartoon arsenal and its boomer shooter-inspired combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers at Fumi Games told us, "The core combat gameplay revolves around an 'Always Be Moving' approach, encouraging players to stay constantly on the move to survive." Complicating that will be environmental hazards, like freeze, turpentine, fire, and explosive barrels that can either be used against you or used by you. But ammo and health are scattered about, encouraging further exploration of the environment. And you won't be a tank; just a few hits can put hero Jack Pepper in a serious world of hurt.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, an assortment of core abilities and unlockable ones will help you Always Be Moving, such as a slide, dash, double jump, pipe crawl, kick, wall run, and wall climb – along with your multipurpose tail that, over the course of the campaign, can be used for lockpicking, helicoptering, and as a grappling hook. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Power-ups, too, will spice up the moment-to-moment gameplay, like Spinach (think: Popeye), Coffee (activates Cuphead-like finger guns that shoot rapidly), Chili Peppers (damage bonus + rate of fire bonus + fire damage), and Cheese (health powerup that can be activated anytime you want).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mouse: P.I. for Hire - Weapon Gifs</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But let's get to the stars of the combat show: the weapons (See a bunch of them in the gif gallery above). There are a whopping eleven of them, starting with your fists if you run out of ammo – but you'll probably never use them if given any other choice. Moving up from there, the Micer pistol is what you'd expect, though it does have a burst-shot alt-fire. Your Boomstick, meanwhile, packs a short-range punch – with a hold charge/pump fire as an alt. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things get more interesting and unique with the Devarnisher, which melts the skin off your foes, Roger Rabbit-style, courtesy of the balls of turpentine it fires. Its alt-fire is a larger blob that explodes to affect more enemies. The James Gun is a Tommy gun that stops enemies from attacking and has a spray fire for an alt. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Kiss Kiss is a double-barrelled shotgun that adds fire damage thanks to its exploding shells. The alt fire on this one is a larger, area-of-effect explosion. The Loose Cannon, meanwhile, really leans into Mouse's cartoon framework; it's a literal cannon like you'd find on a pirate ship that has knockback effects as well as doing big damage. In alt-fire mode it launches a charged-up burst shot. The Jar Head, on the other hand, fires waves of psionic power that stun and eventually kill enemies – and it carries an AoE. Its beam-attack alt is particularly potent if you aim at the opponent's head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last of the arsenal starts with the Portable Freezer, firing a cold beam that slows and eventually freezes foes in their tracks, allowing you to shatter them. The alt-fire spits speedy snowballs. I'm eager to try the Hellrazor, a chainsaw that pummels enemies with fire damage if they get hit with the wave. Its alt-fire is a traditional chainsaw that you do not want to be caught on the business end of.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, the D-namite can take out certain walls and floors in addition to blasting the bad guys to bits.  All told, I'm eager to try out all of these toys. Circle March 19 on your calendar, as that's when Mouse: P.I. for Hire will be released on PC, PlayStation platforms, Xbox platforms, and Nintendo Switch platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our semi-retired interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Closed beta end of February.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has finally announced Guerrilla’s Horizon live service multiplayer game, Horizon Hunters Gathering. It’s due out for PlayStation 5 and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A “small-scale” closed playtest is due at the end of February, which you can sign up for via the PlayStation Beta Program. Expect crossplay and cross-progression. There's no release date yet, nor is there word on whether it's free-to-play or a premium game. The debut trailer, which includes gameplay, is below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can see from the trailer and screenshots, Horizon Hunters Gathering has a cartooney art style, which is in contrast to the photrealistic visuals of the mainline Horizon series. Clearly, Sony and Guerrilla are trying to create a more lighthearted experience with Hunters Gathering, with the Zero Dawn and Forbidden West more serious offerings. There are strong Monster Hunter vibes, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/05/announcing-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, game director Arjan Bak said that in Horizon Hunters Gathering, you fight deadly machines in tactical three-player co-op action and adapt your Hunter for intense missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Combat is tactical, reactive, and deeply skill-based, building on the tactical precision of the Horizon games while embracing the dynamics of team play," Bak said. "The foundation of Horizon Hunters Gathering centers around challenging and replayable hunts."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bak confirmed two game modes: Machine Incursion, which is described as "a high-intensity mission" where waves of machines pour out from underground gateways, led by a "formidable boss"; and Cauldron Descent, a longer, multi-stage trial in which "ever-changing rooms push Hunters to their limits, from brutal machine encounters to hidden doors that promise power and reward for teams prepared to open them." Both modes wil be available in the upcoming closed playtest.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a roster of Hunters to play as, each with distinct melee or ranged playstyles and weapons. Bak said there's also a rogue-lite perk system to craft the build you want. Story wise, there's a narrative campaign "which will introduce new mysteries, characters, and threats, but we’re keeping it under wraps for now," Bak said. "What we can say is that Hunters Gathering is fully canon and its story doesn’t stop at launch!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The social hub is the name of the game: Hunters Gathering. It's "a vibrant social hub where players can connect, prepare, and celebrate victories together. Here, you can customize your Hunters, visit vendors, upgrade gear, and team up for your next adventure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horizon Hunters Gathering isn't the only multiplayer game set in the Horizon universe. Bizarrely, NCSoft and Sony are working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-interview-with-ncsoft-is-aloy-in-the-game-how-will-it-work-on-pc-and-what-about-those-stylized-characters">Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game designed for mobile devices, but also playable on PC. NCSoft is said to be working closely with Guerrilla to craft the world, but this is very much an NCSoft-developed game.
