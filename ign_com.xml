Normally this game is listed for $49.99, but it's currently down to $39.99 so you can save $10 on it.

It's a game that "hopefully will be the gold standard Sega holds itself to when it decides to bring back other Sonic games from the past."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for even more Nintendo Switch games on sale, you're in luck.
