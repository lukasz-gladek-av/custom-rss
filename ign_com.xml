With the recent release of Nintendo Switch 2, many players are jumping into the Nintendo Switch ecosystem for the first time, and there are dozens of amazing games waiting for them. There is no bigger Nintendo franchise than Super Mario, and the Nintendo Switch received <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-mario-games-on-nintendo-switch">many of the plumber's best entries to date</a>. Today, you can save on select Mario games like Super Mario Odyssey, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a>, and more. It's not every day that Nintendo games go on sale, especially from the Super Mario series, so don't miss your chance to save with these limited summer deals.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Deals on Mario Games for the Switch Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury brought one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/editors-choice/games/wii-u">best Wii U games</a> to Switch, and it's better than ever with a brand-new expansion. The base game has 12 different worlds to explore, with both local and online co-op available for up to four players. New to this version of the game is Bowser's Fury, an entirely unique experience that features 100 different Cat Shines to collect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even at $41.99, Super Mario Odyssey is well worth the price of admission. It's still arguably the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-super-mario-games">best Mario game</a> to date, featuring a giant sandbox to explore, hundreds of collectibles, and an unbelievable soundtrack. For 3D platformer fans, Odyssey is nothing short of a masterpiece, and it's a game you can replay time and time again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> is another game that was given a second life on Nintendo Switch, having first released on Nintendo 3DS in 2013 as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/21/luigis-mansion-dark-moon-review">Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon</a>. Finally, there's also the Ubisoft-developed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-review">Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope</a>. This sequel to Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle improves on nearly everything from its predecessor, with all sorts of humor and chaotic battles awaiting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're buying for your Nintendo Switch console, the eShop will be your best bet. However, if you wish to purchase a key to either gift to a friend or redeem on your console, Humble Bundle has the same Mario games on sale for similar prices.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Steam Summer Sale Is Also Live Now</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to Nintendo's sale, Steam has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-summer-sale-best-pc-game-deals">also launched its annual summer sale</a> on PC games. If you're looking to find some discounts outside of Nintendo, this is one of the best times of the year to do so. Below is a quick roundup of some of the best discounts in that sale as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/fast-fusion-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fast-fusion-review.1230519/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Following in the jet trail of futuristic racing games like F-Zero and Wipeout, Fast Fusion’s blistering speed has all the hallmarks of what has made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/fast-racing"><u>the Fast series</u></a> so fun since its 2011 debut. Every muscle in my body tensed up as I blazed through its handful of sci-fi courses, boosting my way to the finish line while using the new jumping mechanic to find shortcuts. As one of only a very small handful of current <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review"><u>Nintendo Switch 2</u></a> exclusives, this is a dazzling technical showcase for the power of Nintendo’s newly minted system – but annoying progression choices and minimally inventive changes to a well-worn formula dull some of Fast Fusion’s shine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If I had a dollar for every racing series that added the ability to jump as part of its arrival on Switch 2, I’d only be two bucks richer, but it’s still weird that it happened twice. That jump option is also just about the only thing Fast Fusion and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review"><u>Mario Kart World</u></a> have in common: where the latter takes things in a bold new direction with its open world, here developer Shin’en sticks to what it’s done well since Fast Racing League on Wii. There are a few new bells and whistles to mess with as you tear through its fifteen courses ( three of which were added in its first update on June 26), but this flavor of hypersonic speed will largely be very familiar to anyone who has played past entries.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fast Fusion Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of F-Zero or Wipeout will also know the drill: Fast Fusion is set in a distant future where the only speed is fast and every road is dangerous. High-tech racing machines careen through obstacle-laden courses at blinding speeds. The Fast series sets itself apart with a unique boost system, where driving over boost pads or through other elements of the course will give you an extra push as long as you switch your vehicle to the corresponding orange or blue color. Making that swap only takes the press of a button and rewards you with a satisfying burst of speed. Fast Fusion knows how good it feels to go faster than the speed of sound, and it leans into it as its highly detailed, staggeringly impressive environments melt into a blur as you carve through them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also collect orbs to fill up an independent boost meter, and switching as you weave between tight turns before boosting through a straightaway to shave nanoseconds off your time adds just enough to focus on without becoming overbearing. But that has always been true of the Fast formula, and Fast Fusion’s jump button breaks from tradition in a smart but ultimately not too impactful way. Shin’en used this change to add more complexity to its courses with alternate paths stacked on top of each other, but I wish the Munich-based studio had leaned into the change even more, as it doesn’t amount to much more than adding small shortcuts and an extra way to dodge some obstacles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are still fun, but I feel like there’s just a bit too much rigidity in how and where you can use the jump to put yourself ahead. It has a ton of range, and you can cover some massive gaps with the right timing, but I never felt rewarded by pushing these mechanics to the absolute limit or mastering them beyond jumping where it felt natural or obvious.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is easily one of the most impressive-looking Switch 2 games available right now.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The mechanical changes from 2017’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review"><u>Fast RMX</u></a> on the original Switch to Fast Fusion mirror the similarly incremental jump in graphical power between these hardware generations, leaning into one or two specific improvements rather than attempting a complete overhaul. This is easily one of the most impressive-looking Switch 2 games available right now, with incredible lighting and gorgeously smooth visuals while playing in 4K docked, but it’s missing some of the initial wow factor that Fast RMX had. Don’t get me wrong, it still looks stunning, but the generational jump just isn’t nearly as exciting or surprising. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, Fast Fusion does at least offer a decent selection of different graphics settings, making it easy to favor framerate, graphical quality, or a balance of both. I usually went for the second-best quality setting that promised 4K output and some high-fidelity lighting while maintaining a consistent 60 frames-per-second, but then opted for a higher framerate choice when playing in splitscreen. I love that Shin’en decided to include this option, really letting me juice my Switch 2 for every last drop of processing power it has.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like Formula 1 or NASCAR, futuristic corporations have a mechanical horse in the race. Instead of racing bounty hunters and samurai clashing on the track, you’re controlling faceless cars made or sponsored by different manufacturers. That sterile, far-flung futuristic vibe has the same somewhat empty, tech-demo-like feeling you see in those videos of Unreal Engine fan mockups where a beloved character runs around a grey box and the comments are begging some publisher to, “Please hire this man.” But Fast Fusion moves so quickly that you hardly have any time to pay attention to those basic-looking spiky balls rolling around the course unless you’re doing your best to steer around them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Separated by standard racing stats like top speed, acceleration, and boost, Fast Fusion’s garage has a great selection of vehicle configurations that cater to tons of different playstyles. Maybe you’ll aim for a high boost stat, which rewards you for precisely switching between blue and orange when driving over boost pads or through color-coded zones. Alternatively, a high acceleration stat makes it easier to get your zero-G legs, allowing you to catch up to the herd more quickly as you contend with Fast Fusion’s somewhat punishing wipeouts. I usually went for a blend of high top speed and boost once I got used to each course, dodging obstacles and nailing hairpin turns while optimizing routes that allowed me to boost as much as possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finding that perfect build isn’t easy at first because you start with a paltry three vehicles, and are forced to use the in-game currency won by completing races to expand your stable of zero-gravity racers – and eventually fuse them together. Fusing vehicles results in goofy corporate merger names and better vehicles with improved stats. You’re all but required to unlock higher-grade vehicles and fuse them to compete at the highest speeds and difficulties Fast Fusion will throw at you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each fusion is nebulously graded on a lettering system, which I still haven’t completely deciphered even after a dozen hours of racing. But as far as I can tell, it rewards saving up cash to unlock the most expensive vehicles you can and kit-bashing two high-ticket rides together more than anything else. Frustratingly, fusing racing machines removes the option to use either of the original, pre-fusion vehicles. I get this from a flavor perspective, but it doesn’t make sense within the context of an arcade-y racing game where you want to unlock many different options. Fusing and de-fusing cost in-game currency, making its artificial scarcity all the more annoying; this wouldn’t be as much of a problem if you didn’t also need to use that currency to unlock new cups to compete in. To make things even worse, Fast Fusion forces you to unlock the second, third, and fourth cups in each speed class, which doubles as a difficulty setting. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What it lacks in quantity, it makes up for in quality.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I understand that Fast Fusion isn’t meant to be as forgiving or easy to pick up as a kart racer; gating higher difficulties behind reaching the winners’ podium in every cup would make sense. But obscuring cups I’ve already completed by making me unlock them at every difficulty – while also making me buy nearly every car and then additionally pay to fuse them into better ones – unnecessarily stalls Fast Fusion’s economy. It’s like putting training wheels on a Harley.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Side modes can at least make for fun alternate ways to earn extra cash beyond just repeating the same cup over and over again, like the sudden death-style Hero Mode where your vehicle’s boost and health are linked. That’s neat, but I wish the challenges offered in these other modes had a little bit more going on. Instead, they’re mostly just slight tweaks to a normal race with no change to the courses themselves, which doesn’t alleviate the repetitive grind of unlocking everything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to 2015’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review"><u>Fast Racing Neo</u></a>, Fast Fusion is smaller – but what it lacks in quantity, it makes up for in quality. Most courses offer clever designs that had me white-knuckling my controller, from a fun series of shortcuts on Yama Crest to dodging tornadoes on Tempesta. This laser-sharp focus on great levels is probably the best and most interesting part of Fast Fusion. Every time I’ve booted it up, I’ve found a new, satisfying way to shave a few seconds off of a lap I thought I’d mastered. Boost orbs make for compelling breadcrumbs in that pursuit, encouraging you to find new ways to approach a turn or hinting at a hidden path or more efficient way to handle an obstacle. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/fast-fusion-review]]></content:encoded>

Many collectors and longtime players have been on the hunt for the hottest printings of their favorite new cards, with some getting up to four versions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/magic/final-fantasy?Language=English&amp;productLineName=magic&amp;q=surge+foil&amp;direct=true&amp;view=grid&amp;ProductTypeName=Cards&amp;page=1&amp;setName=final-fantasy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surge Foils</a>, which appear in other MTG Universes Beyond sets like Fallout and Warhammer 40K, are a unique style of foiling that is significantly <em>prettier </em>than their regular foil counterparts. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL; DR: 10 Most Valuable MTG Final Fantasy Surge Foils</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The market prices for some of these are obviously a little bit insane, but I expect they'll go down a bit once the hype dies down. Though, that could be a while. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, the base printing of Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER is sitting at a <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/630950/magic-final-fantasy-sephiroth-fabled-soldier?Language=English&amp;direct=true&amp;page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">market price of $37.76 at TCGPlayer</a>, so if you're looking for a copy for Commander and not trying to break the bank, just stick with the base version - they're the same card at the end of the day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Make sure you know the difference in foiling; I opened a <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/631023/magic-final-fantasy-noctis-prince-of-lucis-borderless?page=1&amp;Language=English" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Noctis, Prince of Lucis</a> borderless foil thinking it was a Surge Foil (they have the same art) and went to sell it at a vendor, only to be disappointed at the $3 offer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in the old days of Magic (like ten years ago), single card prices were based mostly on their age, availability, and playability. For awhile, cards like <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/100191/magic-magic-origins-jace-vryns-prodigy?Language=English&amp;direct=true&amp;page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jace, Vryn's Prodigy</a> were $100+ extreme outliers due to its power and prominence in that Standard format. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with Universes Beyond sets, casual Magic fans buying into the game to chase these gorgeous treatments have driven up prices. Jace is now sitting around $4 since it's been a victim of power creep, but I'm not sure these Final Fantasy Surge Foils will follow the same trend. Time will tell. Whatever the case, let's have a look at these money cards. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">10.

Clive, Ifrit's Dominant</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223654"><div id="223654" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Clive, Ifrit's Dominant</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ben Starr's performance as Clive was one of the best parts of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, and his MTG counterpart captures his essence well.

I can see this finding a home in some lifegain Commander decks, but not much else, and her design is pretty spot-on to her video game counterpart. Find one as low as $67.34 if you're ok with Japanese. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">6.

However, despite the powerful ability, the cost to get him rolling is high even by Commander's standards. Still, the transformed side is a great representation of the game's final boss. He's sitting at $179.54 market price, and can go for as low as $140. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">4. Lightning, Army of One</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223649"><div id="223649" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lightning, Army of One</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we're talkin'. I'm not much of a red or white player, but I can't deny that Lightning, Army of One has the potential to be broken in most formats. Pick her up for $260.93 market, or for as low as $173 for a Japanese printing. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">3. Yuna, Hope of Spira</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223648"><div id="223648" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Yuna, Hope of Spira</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently at a market value of $275.20, Yuna, Hope of Spira is a creature I believe has a lot of potential. If I were a Standard player running the Zur Domain deck, I'd do my best to find a spot for Yuna. Find one as low as $235.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">2. Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223647"><div id="223647" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a card that gets its value through fashion and function. He's one of the most recognizable video game characters of all time, and his card is pretty great to boot. Doing his best <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/34444/magic-worldwake-stoneforge-mystic?Language=English&amp;page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stoneforge Mystic</a> impression, Cloud is an auto-include in any white Voltron Commander strategy. The downside is he's worth $387.49 market value, and as "low" as $260 for a Japanese version. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bonus: Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">These ten cards aren't the only Final Fantasy Surge Foils available. You can pick up a handful of other fan-favorite characters for a fraction of the cost compared to cards on this list. I adore Final Fantasy IV as much as I do VI, so I'm happy Cecil and Golbez aren't too pricey. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">1.

Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER (who is my most recent Commander deck project) has extremely powerful abilities, and is now a game-changer in Pioneer Sacrifice decks. But like I said earlier, if you're just trying to build decks, buy the base version. You can find this Surge Foil for as low as $674 or $399.99 for a Japanese printing. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where Can I Find Final Fantasy Surge Foils?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy Surge Foils can only be found in Collector Boosters or in the Final Fantasy Commander Collector's Edition decks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or perhaps, collectors will instead be most interested in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-secret-lair"><u>new Final Fantasy x Secret Lair drops</u></a>, instead. It’s been a busy year for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-lair-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Wizards of the Coast’s limited-time mini-sets</a>, and while the company sold out of all three Final Fantasy drops in record time (leaving many disappointed), you can <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn3lV?object_uuid=988b599d-6553-49e5-a375-e0db2835fd99&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">still get them via third-party sellers</a>... if you're willing to pay the inflated costs, that is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a trio of Final Fantasy Secret Lair sets, Weapons, Grimoire, and Game Over, each offering unique art and names for Magic: The Gathering cards. Everything is available in standard and foil, alongside the Japanese variants as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, since they've sold out, you won’t find Secret Lair drops at the same price as you’d find them directly from Wizards of the Coast (<strong>standard $30 nonfoil, $40 rainbow foil</strong>), with most being listed anywhere between <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn3lV?object_uuid=988b599d-6553-49e5-a375-e0db2835fd99&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>$80-$150 or above</strong></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a huge markup, so if you're looking to buy, be sure you're 100% informed of what you're paying for.
