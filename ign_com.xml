In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/09/xbox-developer-direct-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Microsoft said fans “will get an inside look at a selection of highly anticipated games coming to Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Game Pass players this year.” That confirms a focus on 2025 games only.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect developers to offer an in-depth look at their upcoming titles. Compulsion Games will show off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, Sandfall Interactive will showcase <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and id Software will reveal more on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft also teased that it will “visit a surprise location to see another studio’s brand new game.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/09/announce-hero-219a8909f679e8a1d470-1736432409413.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Microsoft will announce a brand new game at the Developer Direct. But what is it?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What is that brand new game? There’s a lot of speculation right now that Bethesda may be ready to reveal the much-rumored <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster</a>, which was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document">listed in documents accidentally published</a> as part of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) versus Microsoft trial over the buyout of Activision Blizzard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, nor Doom: The Dark Ages have release dates yet, so perhaps we'll get those during the Developer Direct. Either way, Microsoft is set to firm up its 2025 lineup of games at the show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
