            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is walking away from making new content from its MMO, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/new-world-aeternum">New World</a>, amid huge layoffs affecting 14,000 roles at the company. Now, there is concern over the status of its The Lord of the Rings MMO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, October 28, Amazon confirmed cuts affecting an eye-watering 14,000 roles. It’s one of the biggest round of layoffs the tech giant has ever seen, and comes at a time when other companies in the tech sector, such as Microsoft and Meta, have made similarly huge cuts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also comes at a time when Amazon is performing well. So why are they happening? AI, basically. In <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-workforce-reduction" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a note to employees</a>, Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon, said:</p><blockquote>Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. Across our businesses, we're delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this all mean for Amazon’s gaming business? According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, nothing good. There are “significant” cuts coming to Amazon’s video game operation, which will reduce development work and layoff staff mainly in its Irvine and San Diego offices.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The New World changes are a part of that, and while the game will remain online during 2026, this is basically the beginning of the end for once hugely popular MMO. Let’s remember, New World was a rare hit for Amazon in the video game space, and followed multiple flops that resulted in game and studio closures. The MMO set in an alternate 1600s America saw huge player numbers on Steam, with a whopping 913,634 peak concurrents on Valve's platform back in 2021. Player numbers have significantly declined since that peak, however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloomberg said Amazon is cutting back especially on MMOs, but will continue to develop Amazon Games Montreal’s strategy March of Giants, its new Tomb Raider game in the works at Crystal Dynamics, and "casual and AI-focused games" for its cloud gaming service Luna. UK studio Maverick Games will continue to work on its racing game, too. Amazon Games also continues to publish externally developed games such as Lost Ark and Throne &amp; Liberty in western markets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is also working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">an in-house The Lord of the Rings MMO</a>, although we haven’t heard much about it since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-mmo-coming-from-new-world-developer-amazon-games">it was announced in 2023</a>. In August last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-still-seeking-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-christoph-hartmann-interview">Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann told IGN</a> the company had 10 games in development and was negotiating "a couple more." These include Tomb Raider and The Lord of the Rings MMO, as well as the new driving game from the former developers behind Forza Horizon.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Tomb Raider Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On The Lord of the Rings MMO, however, Hartmann insisted it was still early days. "We're still trying to find the hook, find that idea of what it is because we don't just want to go and do the same thing over," Hartmann said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While it's tempting sometimes with an existing IP, that's not the point of doing it. You've got to find a fresh twist, and we're still, I think, in that period where we really want to find out what could be the hook, what could be the thing which is different to all the other games out there. So it's a little bit early.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Amazon for an update on The Lord of the Rings MMO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also plenty of questions around Tomb Raider, which has been caught up in the mire around the Embracer Group. Hartmann mostly waved off those concerns, saying that developer Crystal Dynamics is "fairly sheltered from everything going on with Embracer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"People obviously look at what the parent company is doing, but it never impacted on resources, never led to any changes on management for them, so they're fine. I mean, doing a new Tomb Raider, the bar is so high. The longer you go, the expectation goes higher, so it's a huge, huge task, but things are progressing. I mean, there's some really great ideas here," Hartmann said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Obviously, we're not going to share any with you even if we would love to, but things are going well, things are moving forward. And from what I could tell, Crystal was pretty sheltered, because also when you look before...they went through a couple of ownership changes anyway before, it's not brand new for them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-more-following-perfect-dark-cancelation">Crystal Dynamics recently laid off a number of workers following Microsoft’s cancelation of the Perfect Dark reboot</a>. At the time, the studio insisted Tomb Raider was still in development and unaffected by the decision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crystal Dynamics was originally brought in to revitalize Perfect Dark after struggles getting the project moving with former co-developer, Certain Affinity. Crystal was later acquired by the Embracer Group in 2022, at which time the studio was revealed to have 273 employees across its Austin, Bellevue, and San Mateo offices. Crystal laid off 10 people in 2023, and laid off 17 more people earlier this year. It's unclear how many remain now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I get there is a debate about that…"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a> director Naoki Hamaguchi is once again championing the infamous "yellow paint" to guide players, saying "there is definitely a need" for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using yellow paint on ledges and walls to indicates a traversable area in a video game has been a hot topic among players ever since its rise in popularity in the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/13/uncharted-drakes-fortune-review"><u>Uncharted on PlayStation 3</u></a>. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth uses this tactic too, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sparks-yellow-paint-debate-once-again"><u>players sharing their thoughts on it</u></a> and leaving Hamaguchi himself surprised about the debate it stirred at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/oh-no-the-yellow-paint-debate-is-back-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-says-there-is-definitely-a-need-for-that-kind-of-thing-and-the-only-real-question-is-about-how-its-done/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesRadar+</u></a>, Hamaguchi said he understood there are some people who don't want or need the yellow paint, but insisted that it was necessary.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I get there is a debate about that, whether that fits with that world or not, whether some people want it, some people don't," Hamaguchi said. "I think as a game, there is definitely a need for that kind of thing in a lot of ways. I think obviously different developers experiment, try different things about what works best, what fits best, the right way of doing that in their game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The need to guide players around from from a gameplay perspective and show them what can be done, what they need to do, there is definitely times where that is needed," he added. "So I think obviously there is more of a debate about how it's done, what level and what works. And there'll still be people who say, 'No, that doesn't fit at all. We don't like that.' That's fine, but I think there is definitely a need there, and it's something that is definitely worth looking at."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the yellow paint debate kicked off with Rebirth last year, some said they didn't like how in-your-face the hand-holding was not just in Final Fantasy 7 Remake, but modern video games. Others, however, pointed out that it could be helpful, and was an important accessibility feature. Developers, too, weighed in, with some highlighting how in playtests and focus groups, players sometimes struggle to work out where to go, get frustrated, and quit playing altogether. Because of this, somewhat obvious and sometimes unrealistic visual clues are needed to help point players in the right direction. And some have pointed out that video games have featured visual clues for exploration and progression for decades now.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">With discussion around the yellow paint in FF7R, who remembers the options red/green arrows plus giant pointer available in the original FF7? <a href="https://t.co/qMLnKh3rGw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/qMLnKh3rGw</a></p>— John Linneman @dark1x.bsky.social (@dark1x) <a href="https://twitter.com/dark1x/status/1756686944178676036?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Based on Hamaguchi's comments, perhaps fans can expect the yellow paint to return for Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3. Speaking of which, Square Enix said last year that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-hoping-to-release-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-finale-by-2027"><u>its goal was to see the finale launch by 2027</u></a>.

Hamaguchi said it had not been "pre-determined yet" despite the success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33"><u>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33,</u></a> which boasts traditional JRPG-inspired turn-based combat and recently confirmed sales of <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1975924077496852782" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>5 million copies in five months</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
