But this is no <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a>. Indeed, it is no <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-iii">Mafia III</a>. Tellingly, 2K President David Ismailer said of Mafia: The Old Country: "We think there’s a large audience for compelling stories that don’t require massive time commitments.” It felt like a PSA more than a promo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on these comments, Mafia: The Old Country will be a relatively short affair. There is no multiplayer mode, so the story is the entire package. How long will it be? Some are speculating anything from five to 15 hours. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, there are some complaints in the reaction across the internet, mostly from those who were hoping for a Mafia game more along the lines of a GTA than a, say, shorter Uncharted-style game. But The Old Country was never going to be that sort of game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December, I <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-compare-mafia-the-old-country-to-gta-6-dev-says-theyre-not-as-similar-as-youd-think"><u>interviewed Hangar 13 President Nick Baynes and game director Alex Cox about all things Mafia: The Old Country</u></a>, and the prospect of running up against GTA 6, which was still due out fall 2025 at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the interview, the pair dismissed comparisons to GTA 6, insisting Mafia: The Old Country shouldn’t be considered an open-world game at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rather, the pair explained, Mafia: The Old Country is more like Mafia 1 and 2 than it is the open-world Mafia 3. It is a “linear, narrative-driven” game, a “focused package” that offers a “cinematic experience.” You might find yourself driving around an authentic representation of 1900s Sicily in Mafia: The Old Country, or even riding around on horseback a bit like that other Rockstar game, Red Dead Redemption 2, but the similarities to Rockstar games stop there.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mafia: The Old Country May 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, while there are the perhaps inevitable complaints about the scope of The Old Country, I’ve seen positivity about the experience on offer. Many are saying they’re more interested in a high quality, cheaper, shorter story-driven Mafia game than a bloated open-world game filled with repetitive mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, there seems to be a growing call for more of these cheaper, manageable games, with Sandfall’s well-received <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which has sold an impressive 2 million copies despite being available day-one on Game Pass, held up as a potential trend-setter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes as game prices are becoming more expensive, with both Nintendo and Microsoft hitting $80. In a market when Mario Kart World costs $80, a $50 Mafia: The Old Country looks like a bargain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think setting the price at $50 is the move,” said IGN reader BabyGroot1 in response to the Mafia news. “Look at Clair Obscur sales.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yea, I think there could be a lot of fence-sitters that see $70-80 and wait for a game to be on sale around $30,” added Automating_The_Game. “But at $50 they're like f*** it, getting it now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a similar sentiment across social media and reddit. "I hate putting things on a number scale, but if this is one of those games that are like a good 10-12 hour, 8/10 experience I feel like we have to support it as best as possible,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1khtohv/mafia_the_old_country_is_a_focused_experience/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said 99DGE of Mafia</a>. “$50 when publishers are pushing for $80 is so fascinating that we need to reward and vote with our wallets if it’s worth it (that is of course, we can afford it given the economic climate).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was probably going to pass on this as I just don't have it in me for most open world games anymore, but hearing that it's linear, story focused, and priced at $50? I'm on board day one now,” said ElJacko170.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'd rather have a short Mafia game for $50 than one with a needlessly empty open world with almost nothing to do in them like all the previous Mafia games,” said everythingsc0mputer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If they're not gonna add side quests or side activities for you to do like the previous Mafia games, then might as well keep it short and linear.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For all this positivity online, for publisher 2K and developer Hangar 13 it will be <em>sales</em> of Mafia: The Old Country that determine its and the franchise’s future. The game will have a sales target it needs to hit in order for the project to be declared successful, and social media and forum posts do not generate revenue. Hard sales do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes will be on Mafia: The Old Country to see if the success of Clair Obscur really is the start of something sustainable for the video game industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
