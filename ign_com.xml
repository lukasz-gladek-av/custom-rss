            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Reincarnation, Redemption, Return.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix is planning to "share more updates than ever before" on its Final Fantasy 7 Remake project this year, according to game director Naoki Hamaguchi.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a tweet posted by Hamaguchi following today's Nintendo Switch Partner Direct, during which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-this-year">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth received a June release date for Switch 2 and Xbox consoles</a>. The post, which Hamaguchi wrote in both Japanese and English, reads as follows:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’ve announced that FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH will launch on June 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With the addition of Switch 2 and Xbox, the game will be released as a full multi‑platform title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This year, we plan to share more updates on the FINAL FANTASY VII Remake Project than ever before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We look forward to celebrating together with even more players around the world."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We’ve announced that FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH will launch on June 3.<br>With the addition of Switch 2 and Xbox, the game will be released as a full multi‑platform title.<br>This year, we plan to share more updates on the FINAL FANTASY VII Remake Project than ever before.<br>We look… <a href="https://t.co/GFImeiPiC7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/GFImeiPiC7</a> <a href="https://t.co/f0TaiDHlhJ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/f0TaiDHlhJ</a></p>— 浜口直樹 /FFVII REBIRTH launches on Switch2&amp;Xbox Jun 3 (@nhamaguc) <a href="https://twitter.com/nhamaguc/status/2019428998875590885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 5, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">This is exciting news for Remake fans, who have been on the edge of their seats for the last few years, waiting for news of the third game in the trilogy, which we have yet to see at all. Though Hamaguchi didn't outright say it, this feels like a tease for a reveal this year. Rebirth left the story on one heck of a cliffhanger, with players left doubting whether the game's most famous twist really took place or not. The third game has a lot of work to do to land the plot plane set up by Remake and Rebirth, and it will be interesting to see how Square Enix does it. Fans have already been speculating as to what Part 3 will be called, following the "Remake" and "Rebirth" titles as well as "Reunion" on the recent Crisis Core remake. Popular suggestions include Reincarnation, Revival, Reawakening, Redemption, and Return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 7 Remake first launched in 2020. At the time we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-review">gave it an 8/10</a>, saying that it "breathes exciting new life into a classic while standing as a great RPG all its own." The game was originally a PS4 exclusive, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-announced-ps5-upgrade-details-revealed">came to PS5 in its fancy DLC-filled form with Final Fantasy 7 Remake: Intergrade</a>, later to PC and Nintendo Switch, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-review-update">Nintendo Switch 2 as well just last month</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth was also excellent, with us <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">giving it a 9/10</a> and saying it "impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion, both as a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenges and an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long."

Further clips show dinosaurs getting pelted with beach balls, repeatedly flattened and set on fire by various objects, electrocuted by a tripwire,  rammed by a minecart and yanked off by a robot arm. Honestly, it's enough to make you feel sorry for them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As well as hairy velociraptors, other Zino species include one that looks like a vampire bat, and another hairy creature that looks a cross between a dragon and that thing from The Neverending Story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A life-or-death struggle begins deep below Tokyo, where clear thinking and split-second decisions could make all the difference," reads an official blurb. "You play as Anne, a survivor who finds herself in a network of subterranean caverns overrun by Zino – mysterious creatures that resemble dinosaurs. Use stealth, strategy, quick thinking and unwavering determination to escape the prehistoric world alive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most interesting thing about the game is your ability to share control with up to three other players across Switch and Switch 2 consoles via GameShare. Here, control of Anne's movement, actions, abilities and even the game's camera can be portioned out to a group.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokyo Scramble launches exclusively for Switch 2 on February 11 via the Nintendo eShop.
