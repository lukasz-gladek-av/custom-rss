Set on the mysterious planet of Tau Ceti IV, Marathon will see players inhabit the bodies of Runners, cybernetic mercenaries who have been designed to survive the planet’s harsh environments. While exploring the lost colony that once inhabited the surface, players will search for valuable loot, including new weapons and gear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the initial reveal, however, we've seen very little else. We did get a development update video in October<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-shooter-marathon-is-on-track-but-too-early-in-development-to-show"><u> that shed light on Marathon's mechanics</u></a>, but the studio stressed how early in development the game was. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, however, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week">abrupt cancelation</a> of live-service shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord"><u>Concord</u></a>, Sony is rethinking its focus on live-service games. In November 2023, Sony president Hiroki Totoki revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-commits-to-launch-just-six-of-playstations-12-live-service-games-by-march-2026"><u>the company was committed to launching just six of the 12 live service games it was working on</u></a> by March 2026, with the shift signaling the cancelation of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward"><u>The Last of Us multiplayer game</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie itself is not without controversy, too.
