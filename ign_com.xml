For that final the top ten The Hunt: Mega Edition competitors will be invited to Roblox HQ for their shot at the jackpot. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The full list of 25 different Roblox experiences that make up The Hunt: Mega Edition Event are:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A Dusty Trip</li><li>Arsenal</li><li>Basketball Legends</li><li>Bayside High School</li><li>Blade League</li><li>Clip It</li><li>Car Crushers 2</li><li>Chained [2 Player Obby]</li><li>Drive World</li><li>Eat the World</li><li>Fisch</li><li>Hell's Kitchen</li><li>Infection Gunfight</li><li>It Girl</li><li>Metro Life</li><li>Natural Disaster Survival</li><li>Pet Simulator 99</li><li>PRESSURE</li><li>Regretevator</li><li>RIVALS</li><li>SpongeBob Tower Defense</li><li>Tower Defense Simulator</li><li>Untitled Boxing Game</li><li>Untitled Tag Game</li><li>World Zero</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">That's quite the variety, meaning to get to the big prize players will need to show their skills in games like life sim Bayside High School, cook up a storm as Gordon Ramsay's next executive chef in Hell's Kitchen and survive zombie FPS Infection Gunfight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only catch is to win the money you need to be 13 years-old or over, but even if you out of the running for the cash there are still special ultra-rare digital items created exclusively for The Hunt: Mega Edition to win. For all the terms and conditions head on over to the official <a href="https://www.roblox.com/the-hunt-mega-edition" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hunt: Mega Edition site.</a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is IGN's Managing Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-transmission-march-2025-everything-announced-and-revealed-including-silent-hill-f<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Silent Hill f looks to be a terrifying yet beautiful trip to 1960s Japan.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami's latest Silent Hill Transmission has arrived and it was focused completely on Silent Hill f, the upcoming entry in the beloved horror franchise that will take players to 1960s Japan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-revealed-as-a-new-game-set-in-1960s-japan">Silent Hill f was</a> was first announced in 2022 and was described as a game that looks to take place in a "beautiful, therefore terrifying” world. It was also confirmed Silent Hill f was being written by Ryukisshi07, the acclaimed Japanese visual novel writer behind the Higurashi and Umineko series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After almost three years, we are finally learning a lot more about Silent Hill f, and you can read all about it below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Silent Hill f Aims to 'Find the Beauty in Terror' and Present Players With a Beautiful Yet Terrifying Choice in 1960s Japan</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami shared a brand-new trailer for Silent Hill f and a ton of new details, including that it will aim to "find the beauty in terror" and present players with a beautiful yet terrifying choice in 1960s Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team wasn't ready to spoil what the decision would be, but it did unveil a bit of the story, and we'll leave it to Konami to set the stage;</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Shimizu Hinkao was living her life as an ordinary teenager," the official description reads. "That is, until her town is suddenly shrouded in fog and begins to change in a horrific way. Now, she must explore a town she no longer recognizes while solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and doing everything she can to survive... in order to face the ultimate decision that she must make. This is a tale about a beautiful yet terrifying choice."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new game will be an original story that will be a great place for new players to jump in, but there will be certain Easter Eggs waiting for series veterans. Konami also discussed a few more details on the game, including that it will take place in the fictional Japanese town of Ebisugaoka - which is based on a real place called Kanayama, Gero, in the Gifu Prefecture. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, creature &amp; character designer kera presented a message that should excite fans, as it teases what horrors await them in Silent Hill f.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I love the Silent Hill series, and it's been a big influence on me," Kera said. "In particular, I am constantly remembering Silent Hill 2, and the messages on the walls, the music, and the monster designs. So, when it came to Silent Hill f, and bringing the setting to Japan, we had to come up with something that felt just a little different, and I had to really think about how to get that feeling. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The monster designs were the hardest. I had to consider everything that's come in Silent Hill before, and figure out how to take this game in a different direction, but still be Silent Hill. It might not be the exact same blood-smeared, rusting scenery, but I sincerely hope you'll enjoy our vision and the world we've created."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Music will also be a very important part of Silent Hill f, and the team is bringing together long-time Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka and Kensuke Inage (Dynasty Warriors series and more) to create music for both the Fog World and Otherworld, respectively. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I have composed music for an unsettling yet beautiful world that uses imagery from shrines, blending ancient Japanese court music with ambient echoes," Inage said. "I wove in various techniques that will connect the player to the protragonist's agony, internal conflict, fear, and other emotions."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we didn't get a release date, it was confirmed that Silent Hill f will be released on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Have a tip for us?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-x-first-hands-on-preview-the-new-dual-front-mode-reinvigorates-the-10-year-old-fps<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I was in high school, I would stay up ‘til all kinds of ungodly hours of the night playing PC games. I even stayed up five days straight once, just to get to the end of Baldur’s Gate II ‘Throne of Bhaal,’ but what fascinated me about PC games most was how inventive they could be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One that struck my imagination powerfully was Red Faction, which caught my eye because it had some of the hallmarks of DOOM (a high-tech, first-person shooter set on Mars, you say?) yet it added an essential wrinkle; terrain deformation. Red Faction is set in the mines of Mars, and I could fire explosive weapons at walls, creating holes or destroying them, and even tunneling through rock to circumvent checkpoints. It was all about charting your own course and finding your own path to accomplish your goals. It was incredible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, not a lot has been done with that idea in the intervening years, but when Rainbow Six Siege came out, the ability to freely climb and rappel up and down buildings, and shoot through or destroy walls and ceilings sent a delightful little tickle through my Red Faction-loving brain.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Siege began as a far more focused (and less exploratory) affair than the old Volition shooter, that (and quite a bit more) is about to change with the arrival of the upcoming Siege X update. Apart from gameplay, graphical, auditory, and UI enhancements, it introduces what is shaping up to be a fantastic new permanent multiplayer mode: Dual Front. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Dual Front, a predetermined seasonal Operator pool will dictate who you can play, and team sizes are bumped up to six per side. Instead of spawning directly inside (or outside) one target area, there are three large areas to choose from, each with its own objective, so your team of six will need to split up to focus on both defending and attacking different locations simultaneously. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the scope has expanded, much of the great core gameplay remains the same. When a match starts, each team will spawn in their squad HQ and one of two locations in your team’s sector will start a countdown to a Defend mission. The     is true for your opponents, so each team will need to defend one spot while attacking another. How you handle that, and where you decide to go, is up to you.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Rainbow Six Siege X: Dual Front Mode Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s more, there is a neutral zone in between the mirrored zones held by each team, and extra objectives will appear there. Completing those objectives, such as rescuing a hostage and getting them to an extraction point, will give your team a big boost in the back-and-forth struggle for supremacy, so even if you fail to defend your first location or attack the enemy base, victory is still possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Dual Front expands the contested space so significantly, I was moving between attacking and defending to suit the team's needs, creating a more free flowing experience with way more variation between matches than your standard Siege match. What results is a fluid, chaotic mess I had a blast with.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Dual Front Mode is, so far, a fluid, chaotic mess I had a blast with.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The seasonal Operator pools will be updated every month, and because your squad will need to do a little bit of everything, you’ll have access to both Attacker and Defender Operators on the character select screen. When you die during a match, you’ll quickly respawn and re-select your Operator, so changing strategies on the fly to counter your enemies is a central (and delightfully fun) part of the game now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Several times during my preview, it looked like my current (attacking) team was in a great spot, so I would rush across the map to help my other beleaguered comrades who were fighting for their lives to defend our own base objective. Sometimes, everything was as it seemed: I arrived in time, and our team brought home a victory. Other times, I got separated from my team only for them to be ambushed by reinforcements. Each match was tense, because in maps as large as Dual Front’s, it’s difficult to know where the enemy is until they become a capital “p” Problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of navigating larger areas, I should mention some of the new gameplay additions. You can now rappel around corners of buildings and even sprint while rappelling, so it’s easier to poke around and find ways to get inside structures. New fire extinguishers create concussive blasts and visual obfuscation when destroyed, gas pipes can be shot or damaged to create jets of fire before exploding and scattering fire around on the ground, and metal detectors can be disabled temporarily or permanently. Overall, it’s more fun to play in the space, and there is a lot more space to play in on Dual Front’s mirrored map.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Siege X also marks a shift in monetization. After the update, Siege will adopt a free-to-play model, and for casual versus competitive stuff, here’s the skinny: casual and onboarding playlists, unranked quickplay, and Dual Front are all free, and will grant access to up to 26 Operators and skins. Siege Cup and Ranked modes will be pay-to-unlock, and grant access to all 50 Operators. So if you are jumping in as a casual player, there are no barriers to entry, but new players who want to get more serious on the competitive side will need to fork over some cash. If you already have Siege, don’t worry; you will keep everything you have, and retain access to all modes (and as an added bonus, Siege players will get a badge showing off the year they started and a little bonus for each year of Siege they played).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some other updates in the Siege X package include five modernized maps (Clubhouse, Chalet, Bank, Kafe, and Border), enhanced visuals, audio, first-person shadows, new menus, better player onboarding, the ability to inspect weapons, and a lot more. The dev team has also committed to introduce a new Operator (or remastering an existing one) each season, and a bunch more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But all those enhancements pale in comparison to Dual Front, which is on track to become my favorite mode for Siege, and once Siege X launches, it’s likely to be the only mode I’ll play as Siege marks its upcoming tenth birthday in an incredibly fun way.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In fact, there are so many to choose from that we’ve had to separate them into two guides. In this buying guide, we will go through the several families of board games.

You and your fellow players embark on missions that involve a lot of communication to win. The games each have several pathways that can be taken depending on which roles, expansions, and campaigns you employ. These also make terrific <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board games</a> for when you don't have a group on hand to spend an hour-plus playing a board game.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Want to skip the blurbs and go straight to the various games and expansions? Scroll through the catalog above. If you're interested in the nitty gritty of how all the items relate to one another and to the broad Arkham Horror universe in general, read on below.</p><p id="under-the-dark-waves"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Under the Dark Waves">Arkham<strong> Horror: The Board Game</strong></h2></p><div catalogid="6ff7128b-7dd9-420d-8d49-c99f0802f33f" id="216673"><div id="216673" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror (3rd Edition)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Arkham Horror is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a> in which player teams work collectively against different sorts of terrors. You can take the journey through Arkham as one of six investigators to solve mysteries and defeat horrific beasts. The game has several campaigns to explore, and given the sizable luck component, whereby you have to roll to see if you pass certain objectives and bosses, along with the chance of chaos and occult trickery, well, the games are highly replayable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But be warned: this is not an easy game. It takes a bit of time to set up and to teach to your group. The gameplay itself can last for multiple hours, or can be done fairly quickly if you and your ensemble of investigator partners aren’t lucky. (If you or your mates lose and there are fewer players than six, you can select another investigator to play as, but you’ll start over with that one, losing any additional stats that you’ve gained along the way. Dying kinda sucks, to be honest.) My first adventure with friends on the easiest campaign was disastrous. I’ve played it as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a> (yep, you can also do that here, too), but that didn’t go well, either. When you complete that first winning game, your whole party will cheer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Arkahm Horror: The Board Game Expansions</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are three expansions for the Arkham Horror: The Board Game. Each unlocks a different layer of depth to the base game.</p></div><p id="under-the-dark-waves"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Under the Dark Waves">Arkham Horror: <strong>Under the Dark Waves Expansion</strong></h3></p><div catalogid="6ff7128b-7dd9-420d-8d49-c99f0802f33f" id="216674"><div id="216674" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: Under Dark Waves Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The largest of the expansions is Under the Dark Waves. As the name suggests, this expansion is about the horrors that exist under the water. This big expansion brings eight new investigators on board for four new scenarios. It takes you out of the city and into the sea. </p></div><p id="secrets-of-the-order"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Secrets of the Order">Arkham Horror: <strong>Secrets of the Order Expansion</strong></h3></p><div catalogid="6ff7128b-7dd9-420d-8d49-c99f0802f33f" id="216675"><div id="216675" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: Secrets of The Order Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a medium-sized expansion that includes three new scenarios and three more investigators to travel through Arkham. Secrets of the Order opens up another neighborhood, so you'll explore French Hill while being mindful of the ghosts and monsters that may make your visit the opposite of a quaint French getaway.</p></div><p id="the-dead-of-night-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="The Dead of Night Expansion">Arkham Horror: The Dead of Night Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="6ff7128b-7dd9-420d-8d49-c99f0802f33f" id="216676"><div id="216676" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Dead of Night Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Dead of Night is a smaller box expansion with a smaller price point to match. It has two more scenarios to add to your base game, plus four more investigators to help you navigate the horrors in the dead of the night. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Other Arkham Horror Board Games</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few other board games that act as their own separate Arkham universes. The games are not directly connected to Arkham Horror, so you don't need that base game to play them. Each of these games allows you and your friends to experience a different, stand-alone adventure within Arkham, using characters you may recognize from other iterations. Some of these titles are big enough to have expansions of their own.</p></div><p id="elder-sign"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Elder Sign">Elder Sign</h2></p><div catalogid="6ff7128b-7dd9-420d-8d49-c99f0802f33f" id="216677"><div id="216677" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Elder Sign</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Elder Sign was one of the first games in the Arkham Files franchise. It's a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dice-rolling-board-games">dice-rolling board game</a> that can be played by one to eight players. Of all the games in the Arkham Files, it’s the most accessible chance game. It is a separate standalone game with six physical companion expansions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay is primarily governed by dice. While it’s not entirely like Yahtzee with monsters, rolling dice is the core driver of the game. You’ll have to roll dice to complete tasks and to work through six encounters. You roll dice depending on the stats of your chosen investigator to fight monsters, find clues, and work toward solving the mystery before time runs out.</p></div><p id="elder-sign-expansions"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Elder Sign Expansions">Elder<strong> Sign Expansions</strong></h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elder Sign has six expansions: Unseen Forces, Gates of Arkham, Omens of Ice, Grave Consequences, Omens of the Deep, and Omens of the Pharaoh. Grave Consequences is a standalone deck and can be played with or without the core game. The last expansion was released in 2018. It is currently unknown if there will be any more.</p><p id="mansions-of-madness"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mansions of Madness">Mansions of Madness (2nd Edition)</h2></p><div catalogid="6ff7128b-7dd9-420d-8d49-c99f0802f33f" id="216684"><div id="216684" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mansions of Madness (2nd Edition)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is an app-driven <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">dungeon crawler board game</a> take on the universe. The second edition is a standalone game that exists in the same universe as Eldrich Horror and Elder Sign. You can play it with one to five players using an app to help you through the narrative. The app guides you through setting up and playing the game. Narrative, roll results, and play direction can all be done in the app. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, I dug playing with the combination of the tactical pieces and the app. And if you have to pause the game experience, the app allows you to come back later to finish where you left off. You’ll still have to set up your physical board game pieces when you play again, however, so you may want to take a picture to remember where everything should be.</p></div><p id="mansions-of-madness-expansions"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mansions of Madness Expansions">Mansions of Madness<strong> Expansions</strong></h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two expansions for Mansions of Madness. Both of them are cooperative games that are guided by the app.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mansions of Madness: Path of The Serpent Expansion</h3><div catalogid="6ff7128b-7dd9-420d-8d49-c99f0802f33f" id="216685"><div id="216685" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mansions of Madness: Path of The Serpent Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This expansion takes you to the depths of the jungle, where serpents and other Lovecraftian horrors will bring peril and pain to your adventure. Like the original, it is guided by an app, and you do need the base game to play it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mansions of Madness: Beyond the Threshold Expansion</h3></div><div catalogid="6ff7128b-7dd9-420d-8d49-c99f0802f33f" id="216686"><div id="216686" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mansions of Madness: Beyond the Threshold Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This expansion is significantly cheaper than the other one above. Beyond the Threshold opens two new investigators, two new scenarios, and an insanity gameplay element. Its low price point makes it the most accessible expansion to add to your game.</p></div><p id="unfathomable"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Unfathomable">Unfathomable</h2></p><div catalogid="6ff7128b-7dd9-420d-8d49-c99f0802f33f" id="216687"><div id="216687" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unfathomable</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfathomable is about escaping a sea of monsters on a boat. It can be played with three to six players, though it’s best suited for groups of five or six. This game has a social deduction component, making it an immersive experience for larger groups. Someone is designated to be a traitor, and you won’t know who. It has Battlestar Galactica vibes to it, but in a Lovecraftian mythos atmosphere. Sessions take multiple hours while you navigate the game trying to figure out who among you is there to help and who wants you dead, while simultaneously trying to escape alive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfathomable is a completely different experience than other games in the Arkham catalogue, making it sort of a love-it-or-hate-it type of deal. If you like Battlestar Galactica or other social deduction games, this may be a good option to explore.</p></div><p id="unfathomable-from-the-abyss-expansi"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Unfathomable: From the Abyss Expansi">Unfathomable: From the Abyss Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="6ff7128b-7dd9-420d-8d49-c99f0802f33f" id="216688"><div id="216688" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unfathomable: From the Abyss Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This expansion introduces new prelude cards that offer varied starting conditions, as well as three new monstrous horrors (Shoggoth, the Drowned Spirit, and the Grasping Tendril), plus new skills, items, and boon cards.</p></div><p id="eldritch-horror"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Eldritch Horror">Eldritch Horror</h2></p><div catalogid="6ff7128b-7dd9-420d-8d49-c99f0802f33f" id="216689"><div id="216689" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Eldritch Horror</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Edrich Horror is a different, more worldly experience than the Arkham Horror board game. While Arkham Horror primarily exists in neighborhoods within the city proper (and the sea), Edrich Horror has players navigating cooperatively around the globe to complete objectives. Some have said that Eldrich Horror is like a sequel to a movie. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some things have been changed and adjusted in Eldrich Horror that make it more accessible to beginner and mid-range gamers. It involves a far quicker setup than Arkham Horror does, which is an immediate plus for gamers who want to get things out and get playing quickly. Eldrich Horror also has simpler rules than Arkham Horror, making the "teach" a bit more entry-level-friendly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, Eldrich Horror is more about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a> and solving puzzles. Its first in the series was released in 2013.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Eldritch Horor Expansions</h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are eight expansions possible to play in Eldrich Horror. Those expansions are Forsaken Lore, Mountains of Madness, Strange Remnants, Under the Pyramids, Signs of Carcosa, The Dreamlands, Cities in Ruin, and Masks of Nyarlathotep.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Other Ways to Play</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a couple of other ways you can play in the Arkham universe outside of these standard board games. You can play a couple of the board games online.

I recommend trying the starter set first. Once you’ve gotten a feel for the rules and the game, you can choose to grab the rulebook to start your own journey.</p><p id="arkham-horror-ttrpg-starter-set"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Arkham Horror: TTRPG Starter Set">Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game - Hungering Abyss Starter Set</h3></p><div catalogid="6ff7128b-7dd9-420d-8d49-c99f0802f33f" id="216698"><div id="216698" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game - Hungering Abyss Starter Set</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The core starter set is super accessible for beginning players.

It’s a single-player game that some might find similar to the Mansions of Madness board game expansion. Unfortunately, it only plays as a solo game. If you're open to solo treks into this universe, you can get this digital adventure <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/840210/Arkham_Horror_Mothers_Embrace/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/arkham-horror-mothers-embrace-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Switch</a> for an MSRP of $19.99. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Solo or not, the digital version has gotten mixed reviews. IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arkham-horror-mothers-embrace-review">Arkham Horror: Mother's Embrace review</a> scored it a 5 due to lacking story execution. It fumbles with some heavy topics, which may deter some players from enjoying the Lovecraftian mythos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is also a digital version of Elder Sign available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/257670/Elder_Sign_Omens/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> and mobile platforms. Elder Sign: Omens was released in 2011, but has received mostly positive reviews on Steam. It's quite affordable at only $5.99.</p><p id="the-bottom-line"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Bottom Line"><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are a fan of Lovecraft mythos-themed games, as I am, Arkham Horror is absolutely worth exploring. One awesome thing is that you can play several of these games solo as well as with friends. They are each different and offer a unique presentation of the Lovecraftian worlds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, these games are on the more difficult side. They have quite a bit of chance, which can drastically increase replayability as well as frustration. Setup and learning time can also take some time. You’ll find that the card games are easier to set up than the board games, even without expansions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jennifer Stavros is a contributing freelancer for IGN, covering everything from comics, games, technology, and nerd culture.
