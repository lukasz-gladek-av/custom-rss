Players can play from the comfort of their sofa on console, continue an Expedition on the move with Switch or Steam Deck, build an incredible base on their beefy PC rig, and view it in incredibly immersive Virtual Reality.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Man’s Sky now supports cross-play and cross-save between a huge number of platforms including PC, PS4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X and S, Game Pass, GOG, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, PlayStation VR 1 and 2, and PCVR.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Adding the ability to transfer saves between platforms via a server is especially difficult for No Man’s Sky, as the work involved increases with each platform supported and how long folks have already been playing for,” Hello Games continued. “Both those numbers are large for our tiny team. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of saves exploring across space, building elaborate bases and cataloging their discoveries, with incredibly detailed saves. Adding cross-save for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there the more complicated it is to move them! We also have players who played once at launch, eight years ago, suddenly loading up that save on a platform that didn’t even exist back then!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For these reasons we have secretly been introducing the technology for this update for over six months. We are now ready to start rolling cross-save out to a small number of players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From today, No Man’s Sky all players can link their different accounts together at https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save. A subset of players will be enabled to then select their saves from multiple devices on the in-game save screen. In the coming weeks all players will be invited to do so, Hello Games added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to today’s launch of PS5 Pro and No Man’s Sky’s support for the $700 mid-gen upgrade, Hello Games said users can expect PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) to provide 4K resolution at 60 frames per second. No Man's Sky is also an early supporter of 8K resolution, running at 30 frames per second.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out No Man’s Sky running on PS5 Pro in the video below:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“As well as a much sharper resolution at higher framerates, the increased power of the PS5 Pro has enabled us to ramp up the graphical quality across the board,” Hello Games explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Players on PS5 Pro will see improved lighting, with ultra quality reflections and higher quality ambient occlusion in all modes. Explore the most beautiful and detailed alien worlds No Man's Sky has to offer, for the first time on console.” All these improvements are also coming to PSVR2, Hello Games added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, the Normandy from Mass Effect returns to No Man’s Sky as part of BioWare's N7 Day celebrations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was back in 2021 that the Normandy made its first appearance in one of the first expeditions we ever ran,” Hello Games said. “The limited-time expedition starts today, runs for two weeks and culminates in players being able to claim the Normandy for their fleet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the intervening years since that event, we have welcomed a huge number of Travellers, not least a whole new cohort of Switch players and an increasingly large number of Chinese fans. Many of these new players have envied those who proudly displayed their Normandy in their frigate collection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Mass Effect fans know that this legendary freighter only appears when it is most needed! Today, and for the next two weeks, as a love-letter from one science fiction game to another, we are giving everyone another chance to encounter the Normandy in an overhauled version of the original mission and add it to their collection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Huge thanks to our friends at EA and Bioware for helping make this happen.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/no-mans-sky"><u>No Man's Sky</u></a> launched in 2016 initially for PC and PS4 before coming out on Xbox One in 2018, and PS5 and Xbox Series X and S in 2020. A Nintendo Switch version followed in 2022. Over the years, Hello Games has issued a long list of major updates that have continued to boost player numbers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, it's a busy time for Hello Games, which alongside updates for No Man’s Sky is working on its next game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/light-no-fire"><u>Light No Fire</u></a>. It's about adventure, building, survival and exploration together, set on a fantasy planet the size of Earth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Image credit: Amy Sussman/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think I am a pretty ordinary person," Miyamoto said. "If possible, I’d prefer not to work at all, but if I’m going to work, I want to do so as efficiently as possible. I’m always thinking about how to make what I’m working on a hit, because If I make a hit, this makes my next job easier. I talk about these creative dilemmas at the [new employee] seminar every year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Miyamoto expanded a little by explaining what this seminar entails, as it reflects his own philosophy for game development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Among the game developers who have just joined Nintendo, many of them often play games themselves, and their thinking is that they want to create a fancier version of the last game that they played." he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"However, I explain to them that game design is not about this. It is about looking at the things around you and putting together the aspects that you think would be interesting in a video game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's these ideas that led Miyamoto to develop some of the most beloved video games of all time such as Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario 64, and many more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is of course on the cusp of announcing its Switch successor, which Miyamoto will have been heavily involved in creating. Little is known about the console, but this week <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-officially-be-backward-compatible-with-original-switch-games">Nintendo confirmed it is backwards compatible with Switch games</a>, and Nintendo Switch Online carries forward. Expect a reveal before April 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Amy Sussman/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Discovery has admitted, contributing to a further $100 million writedown for the company’s games business in 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-multiversus-player-first-games-acquisition">Warner Bros. Games acquired MultiVersus developer Player First Games</a> in July just two months after the game relaunched on PS4, PS5, PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S following early access and open beta releases throughout 2022 and 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, and we feel that this will be great for MultiVersus overall,” Huynh said at the time. “We are working to make the MultiVersus game experience the best it can be and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, speaking in a recent financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav and Chief Financial Officer Gunnar Wiedenfels said MultiVersus' failure had added another $100 million to the $200 million writedown the company's games business had already suffered earlier this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. Games' only new game release during the third quarter of 2024 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions">Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</a>, which failed to make an impression.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"... we recognise [the games business] is substantially underperforming its potential right now," Zaslav said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wiedenfels added more detail: "We took another $100 million plus impairment due to the underperforming releases, primarily MultiVersus this quarter, bringing total writedown year-to-date to over $300 million in our games business, a key factor in this year’s studio profit decline."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a>, at the time of this article’s publication MultiVersus had just 686 concurrent players, with a 24-hour peak of 1,741 concurrent players. MultiVersus’ all-time peak of 153,433 concurrent players was set over two years ago, before the game was pulled offline and overhauled. Microsoft and Sony do not make player numbers public.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What this all means for MultiVersus remains to be seen, but earlier this year, after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">Warner Bros. admitted the failure of Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League contributed to a $200 million hit to revenue</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-reportedly-scaled-back-at-rocksteady-following-disastrous-launch">post-launch plans were reportedly scaled back,</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-lays-off-staff-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop">layoffs were reported</a>. Season 4 launches on November 12 and ends January 21, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. Games revenue declined 31% during the most recent financial quarter (July to September), primarily driven by the better performance of the prior year slate, mainly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, compared to the current year slate, Warner Bros. said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to the current quarter (October to December), Warner Bros. expects games to be flat to moderately better year-on-year, as last year’s launch of Hogwarts Legacy on Switch in November will be offset by lower costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Warner Bros. said it’s now doubling down on four games: Hogwarts Legacy (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-2-coordinating-big-picture-storytelling-with-harry-potter-tv-show-storylines">a sequel is already in the works</a>), Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC, "in particular Batman," Zaslav said. Warner Bros. recently published VR game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/batman-arkham-shadow">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> exclusively on the Meta Quest 3, and has a Wonder Woman game in the works at Monolith Productions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are focusing our development efforts on those core franchises, with proven studios to improve our success ratio," Zaslav added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
