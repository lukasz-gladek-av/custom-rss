It’s already outstripped its predecessor on Steam, where 2018's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter World</a> enjoyed a peak concurrent figure of 334,684.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s worth noting that Monster Hunter Wilds’ actual peak concurrent figure will be much higher, given neither Sony nor Microsoft report player numbers.</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is how high can that Steam concurrent figure go as Monster Hunter Wilds heads into its first weekend on sale and beyond. It seems likely it will crack the 1 million concurrents mark later today, overtaking <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> in the process. Could 2 million be possible?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Capcom is yet to announce a sales figure for Monster Hunter Wilds, all signs point to a hugely successful release. (Monster Hunter World topped 25 million sales in six years to cement its position as Capcom's best-selling title ever.) However, the game has a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam, with some reporting performance problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Monster Hunter Wilds review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Monster Hunter Wilds continues to smooth off the rougher corners of the series in smart ways, making for some extremely fun fights but also lacking any real challenge.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help get your Monster Hunter Wilds adventure started, take a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Things_Monster_Hunter_Wilds_Doesn%27t_Tell_You_-_Tips">what Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t tell you</a>, and a guide to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Weapons">all 14 weapon types</a> in the game. We’ve also got a detailed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds walkthrough</a> in progress, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Multiplayer_Guide_-_Crossplay,_Link_Parties_and_More">Monster Hunter Wilds multiplayer</a> guide to explain how to play with friends, and if you’ve played one of the open betas, here’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/How_to_Transfer_Beta_Character_Creator_Data">how to transfer your Monster Hunter Wilds Beta character</a> over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
