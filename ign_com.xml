It involves building a 100-card deck that works with a ‘Commander’, and buying a preconstructed deck is the best place to start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Wizards of the Coast did produce some ‘Starter Commander Decks’ in 2022, but they’ve been harder to find - and even tougher to get for their MSRP of 25 bucks. Thankfully, as we spotted in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-magic-the-gathering-deals-for-black-friday-2025-collector-boosters-commander-decks-and-more"><u>Magic: The Gathering Cyber Monday deals</u></a>, all five are in stock - and sitting pretty at the price they should be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are a great way to get started with Magic: The Gathering’s Commander format, and while there’s no major reprint value for collectors or longtime fans, they’re a pretty solid package.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic’s Starter Commander Decks Are In Stock For MSRP This Black Friday</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are five decks to choose from, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-of-my-favorite-magic-the-gathering-commander-decks-is-just-25-for-black-friday">and as I’ve covered previously</a>, Draconic Destruction is an easy recommendation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This red and green deck is a little slow in the early game, but grows into offering a fleet of dragons with big stats and flying to get around an opponent’s defences. Add in Atarka, World Render as your Commander, and you can give them all double strike when they attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an easy to learn, easy-to-play deck, but it’s not alone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Token Triumph is a green and white deck helmed by Emmara, Soul of the Accord. The game plan here is to build an army of tokens to overwhelm your foes, with some handy lifelink in there, too, to keep yourself in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chaos Incarnate is a red and black deck with Kardur, Doomscourge as the Commander. It’s all about getting everyone around the table to attack each other, while turning creatures dying into life loss and life gain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First Flight is all about creatures with flying, and its Commander, Isperia, Supreme Judge, can hit for big damage and will get you plenty of card draw.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Grave Danger is helmed by Gisa and Geralf, and mills cards to the graveyard before giving you the option to bring Zombies back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.<br>

Andrzej Spkowski's Witcher series is the basis for the entire phenomenon.
