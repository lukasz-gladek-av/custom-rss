            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">News of a Switch 2 version will be announced "very soon."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As Stardew Valley fans continue to wait patiently for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-eric-concerned-ape-barone-confirms-update-17-is-coming-but-he-doesnt-want-too-much-hype-at-this-point">previously announced 1.7 update</a>, creator Eric Barone (ConcernedApe) has dropped a couple small, vague, yet exciting hints about what said mysterious update might entail: a new farm type, and "more character/social stuff."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a tweet/X post from ConcernedApe, where he was asked if he could give any hints about the upcoming update. His response was pretty simple: "there will be some more character/social stuff, it's also traditional to add a new farm type. Lots more but I don't want to reveal much yet."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">there will be some more character/social stuff, it's also traditional to add a new farm type. Lots more but I don't want to reveal much yet</p>— ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001186320765583409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That's not a ton of detail, but certainly enough to spark the imagination. The new farm type was indeed to be expected. Stardew Valley started with just one style of farm map, and since its release, most major new content updates have added at least one for a total of eight different options. Each farm map centers around a different specialty, with the Standard map being fairly generic and open-ended, and other maps promoting fishing, foraging, mining, combat, multiplayer, a combination of fishing and foraging, and animal raising. Currently, this means that basically every type of playstyle is supported, so there's a lot left to wonder about when it comes to imagining what new farm type could be added. Perhaps something that encourages building NPC friendships?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The "character/social stuff" is a little more vague. This could mean anything from new scenes and events with existing characters to new characters entirely. It's really hard to say at this stage!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Popular fan requests for future Stardew Valley features include more NPCs, including more romanceable NPCs, more dialogue and world lore, but also just generally more of everything: more animals, more crops, more decorations, more clothing, more enemies to fight, dishes to cook, and so forth. ConcernedApe <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-eric-concerned-ape-barone-confirms-update-17-is-coming-but-he-doesnt-want-too-much-hype-at-this-point">hasn't really revealed anything so far about what 1.7 will contain</a>, or even when we might expect it. He's given no release date, only suggested that it's possible it doesn't come out until after Haunted Chocolatier releases. Maybe. It'll be ready when it's ready.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ConcernedApe did drop one other thing, though. When asked about a potential Nintendo Switch 2 edition, he said he's announce something "<a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001155907833753682?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very soon</a>." A Switch 2 edition <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/stardew-valley-official-nintendo-switch-2-edition-trailer-nintendo-direct">was first announced back in September</a>, and will bring mouse controls, four-player split screen multiplayer, and Game Share multiplayer to the Switch version. No release date has been given yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We re-reviewed Stardew Valley in 2024 to account for its many, many updates since launch in 2016. While our original review gave it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/25/stardew-valley-review">an impressive 8.8/10</a>, the re-review <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-review-2024">called it a 10/10 masterpiece</a>, saying, "Stardew Valley is not only the best farming game I’ve played, it is one of my favorite games of all time. That myself and others keep returning to this eight-year old gem each time it gets even the smallest update speaks to how it’s truly a masterpiece in the genre it both reinvigorated and has come to define."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But it's not enough to fund a new project.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Horses, the indie horror game that was banned from both Steam and the Epic Games Store ahead of its launch two weeks ago, has nonetheless managed to sell over 18,000 copies, says publisher Santa Ragione. However, that's not enough for the publisher to fund a new game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a press release sent today by Santa Ragione, which says Horses has generated approximately $65,000 in net revenue thanks to sales on GOG and Humble [Disclaimer: Humble and IGN are both owned and run by IGN Entertainment, a subsidiary of Ziff Davis, Inc.]. That was enough to pay royalties owed to creator Andrea Lucco Borlera, as well as pay off the loans the publisher took out to finish development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that's not enough to begin work on a new game, and it doesn't seem likely that amount will be reached despite the significant attention the game's controversy gleaned. The team members are still planning to take on other jobs and projects, with the hope that the publisher may be able to fund a new prototype in the future if sales remain steady for long enough.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"While the launch of HORSES compares very favourably to our most recent launches on Steam, Steam’s economics rely heavily on multi-year long tail sales and, for our past projects, on Steam key distribution through bundles, which has also lately been restricted for low-selling titles," the publisher said in a statement. "These structural differences are why a strong two week result on smaller storefronts does not tell us what a full Steam release could have looked like."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horses is a horror game that follows a young man who travels to a horse farm to work for several weeks during the summer, only to discover that the farm's "horses" are actually naked humans with horse masks forcibly attached over their heads. The game explores themes of complicity and what horrors people are willing to participate in, via the farmer and eventually protagonist's treatment and continued enslavement of these people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game contains a lot of disturbing imagery, including violence and sexual content, but none of that's new for either Steam or Epic. Nevertheless, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">Horses was banned from Steam two years ago</a> after the team submitted an in-progress prototype. While some suggestions were given as to the reason for the ban, no specifics were shared with the team at the time, nor was there an opportunity to appeal. Santa Ragione believes Valve may have objected to a scene present in the earlier version where a child "rode" one of the naked horses by sitting on their shoulders and being carried around. That character was aged up to an adult in the final version of the game, and there are no underaged individuals in the released version.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Horses Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With Valve unbending, Santa Ragione said at the time it may have to close its doors, due to the overwhelming necessity of a Steam release for most games to recoup development costs. The publisher put its hopes in Epic, GOG, and Humble, but at the last minute right before launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too">Epic also banned the game</a>, with Epic citing violations of its policies on "inappropriate content" and "hateful or abusive content." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both bans prompted a wave of criticism from developers and audience members, who called out the banning of the game as both censorship as well as hypocritical, given some of the other content that's allowed on Steam in particular. Santa Ragione specifically has called out Valve for having unclear policies and communication, problems that it feels essentially ensured the studio's demise.</p><blockquote>We also want to emphasize that this outcome should not distract from the broader issue at stake: the need for clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce. For every case like HORSES that becomes visible, there are many more games that are quietly banned, delisted, or trapped in indefinite review for unclear reasons, with developers too worried about retaliation or future approval to speak publicly. We are grateful to the journalists and outlets who have reported, and who will continue to report, on these cases.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Critical response to Horses has been across the board, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review">our own reviewer</a> giving it a 7/10 and calling it "an affecting first-person horror game that, despite some repetitive tasks and signposting issues, delivers a harrowing story you won’t forget in a hurry." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher Santa Ragione has a long history of both developing and publishing standout games. Its most recent successes are Mediterranea Inferno, which it published from developer Eyeguys and which won Excellence in Narrative at the 2024 Independent Games Festival, as well as nominations for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize and Nuovo Award. Saturnalia, developed in-house and released in 2022, received generally positive reviews. Both games remain available on Steam and Epic.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="title3"><svg data-cy="icon-logo" viewBox="0 0 76 24" title="IGN"><title>IGN Logo</title><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M5.38 7.65a7.85 7.85 0 0 1 2.26-2.26c.13-1.18.31-2.26.52-3.21a10.605 10.605 0 0 0-6 6c.95-.22 2.03-.39 3.21-.52M16.34 5.36v.02c.9.59 1.67 1.37 2.27 2.27 1.18.13 2.26.31 3.21.52a10.627 10.627 0 0 0-6.02-6.01c.22.95.4 2.02.54 3.2M7.64 18.62c-.9-.59-1.67-1.37-2.27-2.27h-.03c-1.19-.14-2.26-.32-3.19-.54 1.07 2.75 3.26 4.95 6.01 6.02-.22-.95-.39-2.03-.52-3.21M18.64 16.35h-.03c-.59.9-1.37 1.67-2.27 2.27v.03c-.14 1.17-.32 2.25-.54 3.19a10.59 10.59 0 0 0 6.03-6.03c-.94.22-2 .4-3.19.54M10.04 0h3.9c.85 1.85 1.2 4.59 1.3 5.52.04.22.06.43.06.63L12 9.11 8.7 6.15c0-.17.02-.35.05-.55.1-.95.43-3.75 1.29-5.61M8.7 17.83c0 .17.02.35.05.55.1.95.43 3.75 1.29 5.61h3.9c.85-1.84 1.2-4.59 1.3-5.52.04-.22.06-.43.06-.64L12 14.87l-3.3 2.96ZM6.16 8.68c-.17 0-.35.02-.55.05-.95.12-3.75.45-5.61 1.31v3.9c1.84.85 4.59 1.19 5.52 1.3.22.04.43.06.64.06L9.11 12 6.16 8.7ZM24 10.02c-1.86-.86-4.66-1.19-5.61-1.29-.2-.03-.38-.05-.55-.05l-2.96 3.3 2.96 3.3c.2 0 .41-.02.64-.06.93-.11 3.68-.45 5.52-1.3v-3.9Z"></path><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M42.83 13.9V10h10.45c1.06 0 1.93.86 1.93 1.92v4.63c0 2.38-1.91 4.36-4.33 4.36h-6.69c-4.96 0-8.97-4-8.97-8.94s4.04-8.95 8.98-8.95h10.36v4.11H44.2c-2.67 0-4.86 2.17-4.86 4.84s2.16 4.83 4.86 4.83h6.91v-2.91h-8.27ZM33.86 3h-4.07v16.02c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.15V3M74.37 3.01h-2.18v13.81s0 .08-.03.11a.29.29 0 0 1-.24.14c-.09 0-.16-.04-.25-.15L64.83 4.93a4.347 4.347 0 0 0-3.72-2.11h-.07c-2.39 0-4.32 1.93-4.32 4.32v11.88c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.17V7.14s.02-.09.04-.13a.29.29 0 0 1 .24-.14c.09 0 .18.03.24.14l6.88 12.07c.76 1.27 2.12 2.05 3.69 2.05h.07c2.39 0 4.32-1.93 4.32-4.32V4.92c0-1.05-.85-1.91-1.91-1.91"></path></svg>Recommends</h3></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-sells-over-18k-copies-pays-back-loans-and-royalties-despite-removal-from-steam-and-epic]]></content:encoded>
