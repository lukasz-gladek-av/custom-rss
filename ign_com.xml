And you don't have to get out a measuring tape and ruler to see that they're considerably bigger (<a href="https://x.com/PPNStudio/status/1956796418187784607" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>albeit still a little on the snug side for some</u></a>).</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Here are the borders of two of the larger maps coming to Battlefield 6 ðŸ‘€</p><p>The largest being â€˜Mirak Valleyâ€™</p><p>Via: 1BF <a href="https://t.co/RFCKuyKVnx" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/RFCKuyKVnx</a></p></div>â€” Battlefield Wire (@TheBFWire) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBFWire/status/1956734689655333315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/battlefield-6-large-scale-map-images-leak-comparisons-alleviate-beta-concerns" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>MP1st</u></a> has also shared renderings that an anonymous poster has uploaded to Imgur. They give us a closer look at Mirak Valley â€”  a map located in Tajikistan with mountains and a river slicing through the middle â€” and Californian map Eastwood, which is supposedly coming post-launch, but likely sometime in Season 1. Expect to see a golf course, villas, and bonus vehicles like a boat and a golf cart.
