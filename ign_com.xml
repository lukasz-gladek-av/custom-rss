It's coming out on September 4, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We learned this today via a nearly-two-minute new trailer dropped by Team Cherry, which showed a ton of new footage from the game. We see Hornet exploring, loads of new insectoid NPCs, dreary graveyards, swamps, a bustling city, new enemies (over 200, per the trailer!), new bosses (over 40!) an Ori-style escape sequence, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">First announced in 2019, the release date for the long awaited sequel was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-sequel-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch">finally shared more than six years after Silksong was announced</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally confirmed for just Nintendo Switch and PC, but eventually <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-trailer">Xbox (and Game Pass)</a> and later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-ps4-and-ps5">PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5</a>, Team Cherry has been slowly ramping up the conversation around Silksong after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-hollow-knight-silksong-news-at-e3-2021">going quiet for a long time</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/hollow-knight-silksong-gameplay-trailer">A trailer officially re-revealed the game at the Xbox Bethesda Showcase in June 2022</a>, at which point <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-release-window-next-12-months">Xbox also confirmed the game would be available sometime within the next 12 months</a>. Team Cherry didn't say anything itself, however, leaving some speculation around its release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fervor has reached a fever-pitch in recent weeks, as the game was revealed to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-we-played-it-gamescom-2025">playable at Gamescom</a>, and Geoff Keighley teased with some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-shows-up-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-with-almost-30-seconds-of-new-gameplay-as-a-treat">new footage at Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>. The community around Silksong has turned the long wait for a release date into a meme over the years, getting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake">worked up over chocolate cake recipes</a> and metaphorically "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-the-story-behind-the-insanely-long-wait-clown-meme">putting on clown makeup</a>" every time a new showcase dropped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Congrats to the Silksong lovers.
