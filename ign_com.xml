            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-roadmap-includes-free-updates-driven-by-community-feedback-and-dlc-details<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has outlined its plans for the first year of post-launch content for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows"><u>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</u></a>, including promises to add features like new game+, more difficulty settings, additional story content, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Assassin’s Creed company detailed all of its plans for 2025 in a four-and-a-half-minute roadmap update video published today. It’s a brief but enlightening video with a specific schedule for May and June as the team behind the latest stealth-action entry plots out how it will keep fans coming back with free updates throughout the year.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/30/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-1746033627143.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Assassin's Creed Shadows post-launch roadmap. Image courtesy of Ubisoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The drops begin soon with The Works of Luis Frois, the first of a few free story add-ons, which is set to drop in early May. It’ll be accompanied by a Codex update and a few quality-of-life improvements, with relatively substantial parkour additions and a photo mode update also set to arrive next month. These adjustments and more are part of what Ubisoft says is a continued effort to listen to its community and take their feedback into consideration for future Assassin’s Creed Shadows updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Your feedback has been a core focus of the team throughout development, and that’s not stopping now that Shadows is released,” community developer Daniel St. Germain explained in today’s video. “Regular title updates are coming, each with impactful additions – and changes – based on your feedback and requests, with some bug fixes to continue refining the experience across all platforms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next free Assassin’s Creed Shadows story drop will follow in June, as will more challenging difficulty settings, gameplay immersion options, an open-world alarm system, and an option to keep headgear on or off during cutscenes. These are worthwhile changes that players are already looking to see included, but more features, such as new game+ support, additional story drops, special collaborations, and more, are expected to arrive before the year is out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest item on the post-launch roadmap is the first proper Assassin’s Creed Shadows DLC expansion, Claws of Awaji, which drops at an unspecified point later in the year. It’s said to include new content, such as the Bo staff weapon and a new region for Naoe and Yasuke to explore, across its 10-hour journey. Pricing details have yet to be revealed, though it will at least be free for those who pre-ordered Assassin’s Creed Shadows before its launch last month.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin’s Creed Shadows arrived for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on March 20 and finally takes Ubisoft’s long-running stealth series to Feudal Japan. Its leap of faith managed to land it among <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-video-games-of-2025-so-far"><u>our list of the best games of 2025 so far</u></a> while also emerging as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-for-march"><u>the best-selling game of last month</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-developers-behind-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-hundred-line-recommend-playing-each-others-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Spreading the RPG love around.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There's certainly been no shortage of games in the last month or so, and it's easy for games to get lost in the proverbial avalanche. In a show of mutual admiration, though, two leads behind two RPGs, both of which launched in the same week, are promoting each others' games to fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/danganronpa-creator-says-clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-an-amazing-tribute-to-classic-jrpgs-while-his-new-game-is-a-cult-strategy-rpg-that-will-still-be-here-once-you-come-back-from-your-expedition/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>, Kazutaka Kodaka — creator of Danganronpa and co-director behind the recently released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a> — shouted out players reaching a milestone in his own game. Then, he went on to shout out another current RPG in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. "Even after you finish Expedition 33, this Japanese cult game will still be here, waiting for you!" <a href="https://x.com/kazkodaka/status/1916525336373952567" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> Kodaka.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He went on to praise Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 in a follow-up post, drawing a comparison between the two games' unique takes on their respective genres. "Expedition 33 is an amazing tribute to classic JRPG, while Hundred Line is a cult Japanese VN &amp; SRPG," said Kodaka. "Hundred Line has its own unique charm too, so why not play!!!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sandfall Interactive seemed to notice the shout-outs, and the official Expedition 33 account <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1917500503627555303" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a message</a> from creative director Guillaume Broche:</p><blockquote>"After your Expedition, check out The Hundred Line, another great turn-based RPG that was also released last week, and made with love by an awesome team. There's too many good RPGs coming out at the same time, these days!"</blockquote><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A note from Guillaume Broche, <a href="https://twitter.com/SandfallGames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@SandfallGames</a> Creative Director:</p><p>After your Expedition, check out The Hundred Line, another great turn-based RPG that was also released last week, and made with love by an awesome team.</p><p>There's too many good RPGs coming out at the same time, these… <a href="https://t.co/AmGExVxXUp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/AmGExVxXUp</a></p></div>— Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (@expedition33) <a href="https://twitter.com/expedition33/status/1917500503627555303?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Kodaka <a href="https://x.com/kazkodaka/status/1917597566218469476" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">followed up</a>, with more praise for Expedition 33:</p><blockquote>"Thank you!!!! And for those of you who finished your school life first—it’s time to head out on an expedition! Expedition 33 is the future of RPGs. With unique RPGs like these coming out at the same time, now’s the perfect time to dive in and enjoy everything the genre has to offer"</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">There are, frankly, a lot of games coming out every year. Per <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a>, over 6,000 games have hit Valve's PC platform in 2025 as of this writing. Over 18,000 released on Steam last year alone. By any metric, that's a baffling number, and even games with newsworthy creators may struggle to reach audiences in the massive flood of new things to play. Factor in ever-evolving live-service games and their content update schedules, and everything, everywhere is fighting for your time and attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In light of that, it's heartwarming to not only see two creators acknowledging and promoting each others' games, but encouraging fans to go play them afterwards. In the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/launching-a-successful-live-service-game-is-a-battle-royale-in-itself">never-ending battle for eyes and attach rates</a>, encouraging players to roll credits and move on to other experiences is noteworthy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is out now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is also out now, for PC and Nintendo Switch. If you're close to finishing one, it sounds like you might want to check out the other, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
