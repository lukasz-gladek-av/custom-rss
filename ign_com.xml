Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII Remastered are being released together in a “twin-pack” box, while Final Fantasy IX will have a box all its own. All of the games feature some modern conveniences that weren’t available in their initial release. They cost $39.99 each and are now available for preorder at various retailers.</p><p id="final-fantasy-9-switch"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Final Fantasy 9 (Switch)">Final Fantasy IX</h2></p><p id="final-fantasy-7-8-remastered"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Final Fantasy 7 &amp; 8 Remastered ">Final Fantasy VII &amp; VIII Remastered Twin Pack</h2></p><div catalogid="0493e958-f62a-434f-b66f-21a8c2137182" id="229385"><div id="229385" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy 7 &amp; 8 Remastered Twin Pack</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWEd16?object_uuid=7c2b4a9f-e2be-439b-802d-47e3217b418d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0FVGBTNHF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a> - $39.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8DpB?object_uuid=7c2b4a9f-e2be-439b-802d-47e3217b418d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at SE Store</a> - $39.99</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these games are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-final-fantasy-games-on-nintendo-switch-in-order">already available on Switch</a> (and other platforms) in digital form. But this is the first time they’ll be available in the US in physical form. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy VII was a major release in 1997, and was the first time the series debuted on a non-Nintendo platform. It follows former SOLDIER Cloud Strife as he and a team of freedom fighters battle against the evil Shinra corporation. This version of the game features 3x speed mode, the ability to turn off random encounters, and “battle enhancement mode.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy VIII Remastered is an enhanced version of a game that hit the PS1 in 1999. It follows Squall and the rest of the members of SeeD as they fight back against the sorceress Edea, who’s causing quite the global ruckus. This version of the game has various battle assist options, a 3x speed boost, and the ability to turn off random encounters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of its initial release in 2000, Final Fantasy IX was something of a throwback to the medieval-settings settings of the first six entries in the series. This game follows Zidane and a troupe of actors, who “kidnap” Princess Garnet, who secretly wanted to be kidnapped to get away from her deranged mother, the queen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The visuals have been gently revamped to look better on modern displays. It has other new features as well, including auto-save and seven game boosters, including high speed and no-encounter modes.</p></div><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">Other Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">007 First Light Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Battlefield 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-clair-obscur-expedition-33-mirror-edition-ps5-xbox-amazon-exclusive">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Mirror Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-physical-deluxe-edition-where-to-buy">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Physical Deluxe Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-where-to-buy">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (Switch, Xbox) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-8-and-9-physical-editions-for-switch-are-up-for-preorder-where-to-buy">Final Fantasy 7, 8, and 9 (Switch) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2-where-to-buy">Hades 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-switch-2-where-to-buy">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorders">Kirby Air Riders Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-where-to-buy">Mario Tennis Fever Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-where-to-buy">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-where-to-buy">Nioh 3 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch">Pokemon Legends Z-A Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-pc">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-vs-roster-expands-with-cecil-story-mode-teases-arrival-of-brand-new-character-who-hasnt-yet-appeared-anywhere-in-the-invincible-universe">Invincible VS just announced its eighth playable character: Cecil</a>. The no-nonsense director of the Global Defense Agency is a surprise addition to the roster. He lacks any superpowers, so it’s hard to imagine him lasting more than a blink of an eye against the likes of Omni-Man and co. But Invincible creator Robert Kirkman was adamant Cecil be in the game, and left it to the developers at Quarter Up to figure out how to make him work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Their answer is to lean on all the cool gadgets we see Cecil use in Invincible, which in this 3v3 tag fighting game levels the playing field somewhat. But there’s more: Invincible VS has a sizeable Story Mode in which Cecil plays a crucial role. Kirkman and Quarter Up won’t say much about it, but they describe is as a “playable episode,” so expectations are high.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In this interview with IGN, Kirkman, Invincible VS executive producer Mike Willette, art director Dan Eder, and narrative director Mike Rogers, talk as much about Story Mode as they are allowed to right now, and delve deep into how Cecil actually works in the game. Read on to find out if Invincible VS is canon to the show, details on Cecil's kit, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: It must have been an interesting challenge with Cecil. He doesn’t have any superpowers, but he’s smart and can teleport and uses a lot of weapons. So how did you go about making him work in a fighting game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Rogers:</strong> From a lore and narrative perspective, Cecil's always in control. We often see him as the man in the ear or the man watching the screen, but people forget that he's a trained agent. He knows how to get his hands dirty and he's got all the tech and all the money of the U.S. government behind him that can allow him to do that. There's just a lot of cool things that we've got in there that allow Cecil to be a really different character. We wanted him in there. There was no way we wanted to exclude him. And we saw opportunities like using his teleporter, like using Reanimen, like using The White Room, to get him in there in a unique way that people might not expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette:</strong> From a gameplay perspective, you have all these different types of archetypes, and where Cecil really fits in, in a really unique fashion in our system, is manipulating space, almost like he manipulates people, right? So the ability to put out projectiles like his Sonic Mine, that will basically just hover in space and then detonate after a few seconds. So he can put hazards, put roadblocks, put almost like a bullet hell for the opponent to try to get through. And because of our active tag system, he connects one time, he can tag in one of his assists. And so he's got a lot of utility for just manipulating the screen, getting around it, pelting the opponent from afar, making it frustrating for them, and then putting him back into our combo system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So is he a zoner, would you say?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. So his combo structure, while he does have auto combos like most of our characters, and the magic chain of light, mediums and heavies, he has a lot of utility for the mid and the long range. He can make people try to chase him down. He has a lot of boosted moves that can cause pop-up or hard knockdown. Or for his… we call it Shellhock, he goes down with a Flaxan weapon and he basically launches like a grenade, but when you boost it you can launch multiples. You can do it</p><p data-cy="paragraph">while retreating and try to fill the screen and try to just set up roadblocks, so you can kind of like reset and then continue to pelt from afar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So he can manipulate a lot more than other characters can, because he has to use these tools. He doesn't have an air dash. He doesn't have double jumps. He uses the teleportation a lot to make those old bones work.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/09/gettyimages-2197035483-1760010568385.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Robert Kirkman is heavily involved with the development of Invincible VS. Photo by Michael Buckner/Variety via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Robert, I'd love to know what your input was on this. He’s not the obvious choice for a fighting game when you look at the characters in Invincible. I'm sure fans will love that he's in there. Was he a character you were keen to see realized in a fighting game particularly? How did it come to be that he was in the game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Robert Kirkman:</strong> His presence in the game is something that's really exciting for me because it shows the versatility of what these guys are trying to accomplish with the game, by having characters that you wouldn't expect and working out how Cecil can be equally matched with all the other people that are coming into it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's really great the way they're pulling in story elements. There's a lot of character that is intact from the comics and the show that is clear in every frame of these characters. Cecil actually puts his hands in his pockets when he moves backwards, which to me was something that I thought was just absolutely brilliant. And it's just a really fun aspect of the character that's there visually as he's moving around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's definitely a wish list of characters that I wanted in the game. And Cecil was one where I thought it would be really cool and unexpected if he were to show up in the game. Never in a million years did I think they would be able to pull it off and pull it off this well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm gonna tease too much… I'm going to get in trouble, I can't say anything! But I'm very excited about this game!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Invincible VS Cecil Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I wanted to ask you about the story and the story mode. I don't know if that's something that you can talk about at this stage, but it'd be great to get some input on the narrative side of things, because I do understand that you're going big on that.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Robert Kirkman:</strong> I've been working very closely with Mike Rogers, the narrative lead, and Helen Leigh, who's one of the key writers on the series. She wrote the Adam Eve special episode with me and has done a lot of great episodes for the show. What we're really trying to do is provide an in-game experience that is like watching an episode of the television show. It’s a really cool story that uses the characters in a really exciting and authentic way, and I think goes into some directions that people are really going to be surprised by. There's a lot of unexpected twists and turns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Rogers:</strong> We wanted it to feel like a playable episode. It's this standalone narrative. In the same vein that the Adam Eve special is like a special episode, this is a special episode, too. And just getting to work with Robert and Helen and really craft something that feels right for the Invincible universe, it's been a real treat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is this canon, or is it like a What If? sort of scenario? I know it's an original story, so it's not something we've seen before. But, you know the fans will wonder how it all ties in with everything. They always do. I mean, I do! So what do we actually have here?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Robert Kirkman:</strong> It definitely fits very neatly into the narrative of the show. There's a tremendous level of care going into making sure that the characters are authentic and that everything works. Internally, there's actually a window where we're like, ‘Yeah, could fit there.’ But, you know, we're not going to talk about that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willlette:</strong> Just sit back and enjoy yourself!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/09/lineup-1760010430186.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Eight characters are now confirmed for Invincible VS.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You’ve got Cecil going up against Omni-Man, for example, which on the face of it would be impossible. But as designers of a fighting game, how do you balance everything where that can be a valid matchup, even though you would think that Omni-Man would essentially tear everyone to shreds?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette:</strong> What's so awesome about just jumping right into this universe, there's so much deep lore and personality with these characters and things to pull from, from like all that comic resource. And then you have the show. And it's kind of the rule of cool, what makes this character and what's really fun for gameplay? And then merging these ideas together. And then you get to see what archetypes do they fit within or it's like, are they rushed down? Are they a grappler, are they strikers? Are they long range? You have this kind of triangle and then you're like, ‘Oh, do they fit more along these two aspects or these two?’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then things just naturally start to fall in place, and especially within the meta that we've created of like, it's not just a single character, it's three characters that actually represent your kit. So you get to mix and match all these different things. I want to play pure keep away, or I want to have something that's a little bit more balanced where I do have a big bully who can push the corners and then I support that character with a bunch of ranged or mid-range characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So when it comes down to balance, it's really just seeing what's the essence of the character, what belongs in their kit, and then how it works within our omni tag system, how do characters play well with each other or support each other, whether it's through the assist systems and the different types of assists that they can have, or how they naturally tag into each other. You can play almost any character like a point character or have it dedicated for a very specific role. It's really play the way that you want. And again, we're just given this beautiful sandbox by Robert and company that's just like, God, we have so much great source material. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dan Eder:</strong> I will say one of the challenges of using an established IP is that you have to find the middle ground between being authentic to the IP but also making a fighting game that's gonna work. If you're authentic to the quote unquote power levels of the show, then that wouldn't be a very satisfying experience because it just wouldn't be very balanced. And if you know anything about fighting games, it’s that balance is key. We do want to allow people to be able to play with their favorite character and not be completely demolished just because the other one is so OP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I think as long as you're authentic to the character and there's some sort of plausibility of, okay, that character would use those powers, right? Then I think a lot of it comes down to pure skill of whoever is playing that character. And that's how you stay true to the source material, but also just make it stand on its own. Because I think the reality is that not everyone is going to be intimately familiar with Invincible. We don't want to make this game just for the fans. We want to make this game for people who may not be aware of Invincible, and this would be their starting point. So then that wouldn't matter as much to them. ‘Hey, why is Omni-Man so…’</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette:</strong> We're gonna turn them into fans, Dan!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dan Eder:</strong> Exactly. So I think there's a big opportunity to do our own thing, make the game stand on its own, without relying on the fandom, but also make it very pleasing for the fans. At the end of the day we're gonna have a lot of Easter eggs, we're gonna have a lot of small touches and character moments as much as we can. And I think it's gonna be an all around great experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Rogers:</strong> And Cecil was a character where we got to think about this also. Every character has a round reset in between rounds of the fight where they fly at each other, their fists smash and like, okay, if Omni-Man's fist is smashing into Cecil's, that's not gonna end well for Cecil, but he's got these Reanimen and can jump in and do that for him. He's got the teleporter that can allow him to dash around, sort of in the way he has a conversation with Nolan at the end of Season 1. And we got to interpret that and bring those into like, how do they work in a fighting game? And I think it brought an extra level of authenticity to the character. And that challenge for a character like Cecil yields more specificity, which is great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Did all you fighting game developers all over the world get together one day and decide 2026 was going to see the return of tag fighters?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette:</strong> It's the most insane thing — and it's true — that all great minds think alike! Because we haven't seen a really awesome tag battle fighting game since like Dragon Ball Fighterz, and that's like, what? Eight years now. And then before that, the gold standard was Marvel vs. Capcom. So there was this huge void. And we all approached it differently. Our competitors are different from us. And that's actually a really good thing. And it's interesting, everyone has their own take, and we really like our take. We really like the universe that we get to play in, and we like the violence of it, the brutality of the stakes that are involved, and our unique style of combat and what it means to read someone — you read your opponent and be able to have large amounts of counterplay. Yeah, it's an exciting time. 2026 is crazy!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Why was a tag fighter right for you? And then 3v3?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette:</strong> Obviously being a huge fan of the comics in the show, when I was asked like, ‘Hey, Mike,  what game do you want to do?’ I'm like, ‘I want to do an Invincible tag battle fighting game.’ There's so many factions and teams that exist within the universe, whether it's like the Teen Team or The Guardians or The Lizard League or The Order, like there's just so many. And when you watch people fight, like yeah, there's solo fights, but there's also a lot of team fighting that takes place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's been this lack of team fighter games for such a long period of time. And then this IP had lots of strengths when it came to teams and team synergy, and I always thought about the ideas of like, what happens when these characters team up and do shit together? Like when Eve and Mark fight together, how awesome is that? So we just wanted to play out those fantasies, and what better method than in a fighting game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-wanted-it-to-feel-like-a-playable-episode-robert-kirman-and-the-developers-of-invincible-vs-talk-about-its-mysterious-story-mode-and-making-cecil-work-in-a-fighting-game">IGN's interview with Kirkman and the developers at Quarter Up to find out more about how Cecil works and the Invincible VS story mode</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cecil’s announcement means we now know of eight playable characters in Invincible VS, voiced by the actors who play those characters in the hugely popular Prime Video animated series. They are Mark Grayson (Invincible), Atom Eve, Bulletproof, Thula, Rex Splode, Battle Beast, Omni-Man, and now also Cecil.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb on Cecil:</p><blockquote>A fan-favorite from the Invincible TV series and comic books, Cecil has been one of the most requested playable characters. Most often heard as a voice in Mark’s earpiece, Cecil enters the fight in Invincible VS with specialized weapons, including plasma pistols, projectile launchers and grenades to keep opponents at a distance. His ranged gameplay style is paired with tactical combat, allowing him to play cat and mouse with enemies. Want more? Cecil can also summon a limitless supply of Reanimen for backup; with access to The Hammer — a massive orbital laser — he is a devastating force on the battlefield.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Quarter Up talked more about the Invincible VS Story Mode, which is a standalone narrative set in the Invincible universe. It’s written by Invincible TV show co-executive producer and writer Helen Leigh and Invincible VS narrative director Mike Rogers, in collaboration with Kirkman. Expect over 25 minutes of bespoke animation in the Story Mode, which “plays like a special extended episode of the show,” featuring every announced playable character so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, the Story Mode teases the arrival of a brand-new character who hasn’t yet appeared anywhere in the Invincible Universe. Quarter Up wouldn’t say who, but did confirm Cecil plays a pivotal role in the story.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Invincible VS Cecil Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Invincible has always been as much about  compelling storytelling as it is about bloody beatdowns and fights you can’t tear your eyes from,” said Kirkman.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was really important to me that we capture the essence of both the comic and television series, and bring key characters into the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>[Editor's Note: If you'd like more in-depth hands-on impressions of Age of Imprisonment, check out our recent </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-has-evolved-into-an-even-better-legend-of-zelda-complement?_gl=1*1yrr7k0*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTU0OTYwNDQ0MC4xNzYwMDM0MDY1*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NjAwMzQwNjUkbzEkZzAkdDE3NjAwMzQwNjUkajYwJGwwJGgw">preview</a><em>.]</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s time to go back – way back – with Zelda in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment. Set in the ancient past, during the founding of Hyrule, this hack-and-slash action game will pit the Princess and her allies against massive armies in their war against the Demon King Ganondorf. After several trailers, multiple runs of their hands-on demo at Tokyo Game Show, and <em>probably</em> too much time going over footage frame-by-frame, I’ve come away with seven key changes from Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity that you should know before starting in Age of Imprisonment. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1) This is a True Prequel</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity had a fun story: reliving the war between The Champions and Calamity Ganon. Set 100 years before The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, it was an opportunity to spend extended time with fan favorite characters like Urbosa and Daruk, and take control of the Divine Beasts in the war. The only problem? It split off into a separate side story, making it non-canon to BoTW. That’s just fine for folks who love a good filler episode, but for those of us invested in the complex and often contradictory overarching Zelda story, that was a bit of a bummer. Fortunately for us lore Hounds, Age of Imprisonment is confirmed to be canon to the Tears of the Kingdom story. That means our adventure with Zelda, Rauru, Queen Sonia will tell us exactly how this ancient war with Ganondorf played out. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment - September 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">2) Combat is Evolving</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The hack-and-slash combat at the center of Hyrule Warriors is alive and well, and it’s evolving further thanks to all new Unique Skills. These special moves are tailored towards specific situations and let you execute an aerial attack, targeted toward leaping of flying enemies, and a straightforward thrust attack to use against charging enemies. As the name implies, these are unique to each character. Zelda, for example, can unleash a barrage of Light Arrows from her Bow of Light to bring down flyers, or use Piercing Light on charging enemies, blasting them with a beam of light fired from the tip of her sword. These are strong options that will reward making the correct decisions quickly in the heat of battle, and if used correctly will do immediate damage to the Weak-Point gauges of tougher enemies, setting you up for devastating Weak Point attacks. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Zelda and company will have a massive array of moves to fight back against Ganondorf and his army.&nbsp;</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">3) Sync Strikes are your Ace in the Hole</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelda won’t be fighting alone, and the way her allies factor into battles is evolving thanks to the new team-up attacks. This goes beyond the simple souped-up special attacks from musou games of old, as now the pairs of warriors employ unique tactics when paired together – to devastating effects. Two examples I saw in my hands-on demo were Zelda paired with Raru firing a powerful, aimable beam of pure light that tears through enemies, and Zelda with Mineru summoning Mineru’s hulking construct to use as an enemy-smashing battlemech. Whether it’s every pairing on just select compatible duos, it’s clear Zelda and company will have a massive array of moves to fight back against Ganondorf and his army. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">4) New Hardware Means New Tricks</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Age of Imprisonment is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2, which means it takes full advantage of the more powerful hardware. While I haven’t done a full stress test just yet to see how far I can push the action before the framerate breaks down, I was impressed in my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-has-evolved-into-an-even-better-legend-of-zelda-complement"><u>hands-on demo</u></a> with how well it looked and ran. Also, fighting thousands of bokoblins is more fun with a friend, and Age of Imprisonment makes that easier thanks to GameShare. The idea is pretty simple: if one player has a Switch 2 and a copy of Age of Imprisonment, then another player can be their co-op body by joining the session from their own Switch or Switch 2. Just keep in mind that the session belongs to the player doing the sharing, so once they stop playing the session ends for both players. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">5) Zonai Devices</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">So much of what made Tears of the Kingdom special was the way you could find and use Zonai devices – ancient machine parts – to aid your adventure. You can do that here too, as demonstrated when I tried out a Flame Emitter. This let me fry my enemies with an aimable stream of fire when I held it. It could also be activated and dropped on the ground to burn everything around it. I’ve thrown time bombs into the mouth of a Frox, and watched in trailers as Zelda combined the wind from a sideways fan with a Shock Emitter to create a massive electric cyclone. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">6) The World Above and Below</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Our entire demo took place in the Depths, in the area just beyond Mineru’s Lab. I didn’t get to see a map, but I do know that Age of Calamity covered the entire overworld, and the Depths spans an area just as large. That potentially doubles where levels could take place, and that’s before factoring in the Sky Islands, places we know from prior trailers where we will be fighting. Taken together, there is a lot of potential variety for where levels will take place, and it’s fair to wonder just how big Zelda’s fight in the ancient past will be. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7) Zelda and Link</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelda, despite her title role in the series, has almost always been relegated to, at best, a secondary character, and at worst an off-screen motivation for Link on his adventures. While she was the star of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, her largely non-combat role in a retro-style adventure stands in stark contrast to her place in Age of Imprisonment, wielding a sword as the lead character as the vanguard in battle. Link, meanwhile, is in the “present” many centuries after the Imprisoning War takes place. While we have seen a construct with a strikingly Link-like visage show up in trailers and character art, we know this will be rare, and for Hyrule Warriors first, a case of Zelda taking the lead while Link steps out of the spotlight. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even these seven items barely scratch the surface when it comes to what’s new in The Legend of Zelda: Age of Imprisonment, like a Korok warrior joining the fray, or an all new cast of Champions to defend Hyrule alongside Zelda. Fortunately you won’t need to wait much longer to uncover all the secrets from the great war near the founding of Hyrule. The Legend of Zelda: Age of Imprisonment launches on November 6, exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-7-key-changes-from-the-first-game]]></content:encoded>
