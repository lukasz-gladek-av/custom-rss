Known to fans around the world as ‘Pokémon Day’, 2026 will be a special 30th anniversary celebration as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To celebrate, The Pokémon Company has recently dropped a 30th Anniversary Pokémon Day TCG Collection, featuring a specially stamped foil Pikachu promo card, a metallic coin featuring the 30th anniversary logo, and three booster packs from Phantasmal Flames and Mega Evolution.</p><div id="234519"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234519" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Pokémon Day 2026 Collection</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Proving a popular set, Pokémon TCG's 30th Anniversary TCG Collection is stocked at all major retailers. However, navigating the market requires a bit of strategy; prices are still fluctuating from the original launch price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the week following its release, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a07ekA?object_uuid=e35de0ab-d25e-4849-bb7b-c223bed34345&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGplayer</u></a> reported a low sale price of $18.79, but it's currently sitting at around $26-$27 market price. That’s a decent drop from the $50 pricing we were seeing earlier in the year, even if it is still slightly more than the expected $17.99 MSRP. Still, that's a significant 58.87% drop in resale value in just a month, making this all the more affordable for fans to pick up right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking for the lowest "in-stock" price right now, direct from a major retailer, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pok%C3%A9mon-TCG-Day-2026-Collection/dp/B0G2FVLXVL/ref=sr_1_1?crid=36VQRZIV3UEAJ&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fpJDom5qEWmKC0FcSlN6VIskxWDbsXrw_vz63nbDXOnPWWrJIH7xP97VRCaDCHQoaTT0Ax7GTdN5nAlTKd8v0h9qirbSbiiEWD7eKZwOhLB-lNHalc47TcMFdCpXSBpPCg-DQ0-aLHK6CIw_iviZoheXuUpnyGVWClbf0bjytHgyS6KktRc0tr9vVcWTSni_lAL_vwiFH5wcas89RIfpjBp9RReM80I2BPu6NENeqB5DzDIyrVlAZKqGB5VFaoUy2icu9opjnW-xVdPVcgpB8oJ8vCyIA96S2gcHIWaaKbg.dCTp1x9Nb8Laf8Ks31TMSiKjSHnlOi-hH0k2yZJu17s&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=pokemon+pokemon+day+collection&amp;qid=1768584789&amp;sprefix=pokemon+pokemon+day+collection%2Caps%2C210&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=tcg-ign-20&amp;ascsubtag=06U9e7yJctIoHdAg4l1vnCG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Amazon</u></a> leads the pack at $38.99. That being said, we’ve seen them dip <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-day-2026-tcg-collection-is-back-in-stock-with-a-major-new-discount-at-amazon"><u>as low as $26.99</u></a> here before, so it’s up to you if you want to hold for that or opt for TCGplayer instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Q45Eq4?object_uuid=e35de0ab-d25e-4849-bb7b-c223bed34345&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Best Buy</u></a> is holding firm at $49.99, albeit the listing is via a third party seller, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/aR72pE?object_uuid=e35de0ab-d25e-4849-bb7b-c223bed34345&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Target</u></a> has already been cleaned out of their $17.99 stock - you can’t be surprised at this point!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re hunting for a sub-$20 pull, it’s best to keep an eye on local inventory or set up an alert for online restocks from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg"><u>reputable resellers</u></a>. Just remember - these figures are based on US retailers, so international collectors should factor in global shipping costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking to resell yourself, I’d recommend you keep looking. Given the lack of exclusive anniversary packs inside, it’s not likely the Pokémon TCG's 30th Anniversary TCG Collection will turn over a huge profit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, while the stamped foil promo card of Pikachu isn’t a unique illustration, its status as the first official 30th-anniversary product might be worth something to completionists in a few years. I’d recommend picking up two at or near MSRP if you’ve got the space - one to hold onto as an investment, one to rip.</p></div><div id="235758"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235758" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: First Partner Illustration Collection - Series 1</h3></p></div></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, the next best 30th anniversary set to keep an eye out for is the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-first-partner-illustration-collection-explainer">First Partner Illustration Collection series</a>, with the first release incoming on March 20. That will feature a Promo Booster Pack, where you can pull three of nine illustration rare-style promo cards. Each of these cards feature stunning illustrations of beloved first partner Pokémon,  such as the Kanto region's Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the 30th anniversary celebrations, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-full-release-schedule-2026"><u>one more Pokémon TCG set</u></a> to be released in the first quarter of the year - Perfect Order.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">What are the odds?</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The attorney general of New York Letitia James is suing Valve, alleging the platform illegally promotes gambling to children.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-sues-game-developer-promoting-illegal-gambling-through" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release issued by the attorney general's office today</a>, which states that following an investigation, the office of the attorney general "found that Valve’s video games, including Counter-Strike 2, Team Fortress 2, and Dota 2, enable gambling by enticing users to pay for the chance to win a rare virtual item of significant monetary value."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In Valve’s most popular game [Counter-Strike 2], the process resembles a slot machine, with an animated spinning wheel that eventually rests on a selected item. The randomly selected virtual items have no in-game functionality but can be sold online for money, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/counter-strike-skin-sells-for-over-1-million">one item reportedly being sold for more than $1 million</a>. The lawsuit alleges that Valve has made billions of dollars luring its users, many of whom are teenagers or younger, to engage in gambling in the hopes of winning expensive virtual items that they can cash in on. With this lawsuit, Attorney General James seeks to permanently stop Valve from continuing to promote illegal gambling in its games and to pay disgorgement and fines."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The lawsuit itself describes both the mechanics of how loot boxes work in all three games, as well as the ways in which users can "cash in" virtual items, either by selling them on the Steam Community Market, or by connecting their accounts to third-party marketplaces, the latter of which the attorney general's office says it found Valve "facilitates and even assists." The attorney general's office argues that Valve's loot box model is "quintessential gambling, prohibited under New York's Constitution and Penal Law." Gambling is illegal in New York with only some exceptions, which the attorney general says are all irrelevant here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question of whether loot boxes can or should be regulated as gambling has been ongoing for more than a decade, with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/loot-box-state-of-play-2024-another-trip-around-the-world-of-regulation" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different countries issuing various regulations around them over the years</a>. China, South Korea, and some other countries require companies to disclose odds on receiving certain items in very specific ways. In Australia, the presence of loot boxes automatically nets a game an M rating (not recommended for children under 15, albeit not legally restricted), and anything with simulated gambling gets an R18+ rating, meaning it cannot be sold to minors. Belgium has attempted to ban them entirely, though it is apparently struggling to enforce this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The New York lawsuit aims to permanently stop Valve from promoting gambling features in its games, make full restitution to consumers and give up all profit its made from this practice, and pay fines for violation of New York laws. If successful, this case could have significant ripple effects on the rest of the industry, as companies are forced to confirm to an increasing array of different loot box laws in different regions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Illegal gambling can be harmful and lead to serious addiction problems, especially for our young people,” said Attorney General James in a statement. “Valve has made billions of dollars by letting children and adults alike illegally gamble for the chance to win valuable virtual prizes. These features are addictive, harmful, and illegal, and my office is suing to stop Valve’s illegal conduct and protect New Yorkers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has reached out to Valve for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
