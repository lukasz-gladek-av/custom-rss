Kennedy will return as the game’s second playable protagonist. Although he has aged a bit since we last saw him, Japanese fans have been taking to social media to praise Leon’s suave, older look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Slated for a multiplatform release on February 27, 2026, Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth mainline title in Capcom’s survival horror series. It will introduce new main character Grace Ashcroft, an FBI analyst who is investigating a series of mysterious deaths that seem to be linked to Victor Gideon, a former Umbrella Corp. researcher. While it seems that Grace’s parts of the game will play more like typical survival horror, the new trailer, below, gave fans a peek at Leon’s more action-orientated zombie-battling gameplay, complete with chainsaw. “Grace’s gameplay style is based on Resident Evil 2, whereas Leon’s is based on Resident Evil 4,” director Akifumi Nakanishi revealed in a recent interview with<a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/2512124p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> Denfaminicogamer</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Leon has always had his fans, the D.S.O agent’s middle-aged incarnation is getting much praise from Japanese speaking users on X. He’s already being affectionately called <em>ikeoji </em>(literally, “hot uncle” — a cool and attractive older guy). “Leon’s gradually becoming a hot uncle” one <a href="https://x.com/haniwa_yukkuri/status/1999433332824961140?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user</u></a> mused. Sharing some screenshots, another user<a href="https://x.com/negisiogyutane/status/2000154859803488548?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> chimed in</u></a> with “Leon’s aging in a cool way.” Another user <a href="https://x.com/umesooooo/status/1999314797108822499?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>summed up</u></a>: “Resident Evil 9’s Leon is too hot. He’s 49 in this (as of 2026)? He’s so suave."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are also getting inspired to draw Leon’s new look. “Leon in Resi 9’s new trailer is too damn fine,” said one user, posting the following fan art. “He’s aging in such a wonderful way, while retaining his coolness. I’m really looking forward to meeting this Leon,” enthused <a href="https://x.com/rain_rain1192/status/1999346834343673964?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another user</u></a>. “He’s turning into a hot older guy, like Keanu Reeves!” said one <a href="https://x.com/SzbSPfoK2FCnJe4/status/1999412747344499085?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commenter</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">RE9新トレーラーのレオンが良すぎて。 <a href="https://t.co/PIkrWuylo1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/PIkrWuylo1</a></p>— □ (@dbox_2525) <a href="https://twitter.com/dbox_2525/status/1999474848154943767?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Other eagle-eyed trailer viewers have <a href="https://x.com/umesooooo/status/1999376630771499194?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>noticed</u></a> that Leon seems to have some kind of rash on his neck, prompting concerns that he has been infected. While many seem to be enjoying middle-aged Leon’s looks, <a href="https://x.com/NkVkGMw4Mt49044/status/1999455932095537519?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>others</u></a> are worried as to whether he should still be fighting off mutants at his age, with one person saying: “I love Leon, but they should let him rest.” In the previously mentioned Denfaminicogamer interview, Resident Evil Requiem’s director revealed that Leon has a “major secret” that will have significant implications (but he’s keeping quiet on what exactly that is).</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">コメントで教えてもらったけど<br>レオン..感染してるのかい？...<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%90%E3%82%A4%E3%82%AA%E3%83%8F%E3%82%B6%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%83%AC%E3%82%AF%E3%82%A4%E3%82%A8%E3%83%A0?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#バイオハザードレクイエム</a> <a href="https://t.co/6GY05WqofY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6GY05WqofY</a></p>— それいけジェットでやってみよう！ (@neko_sougo) <a href="https://twitter.com/neko_sougo/status/1999397917627736427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Legendary Japanese game developer Hideki Kamiya also weighed in on Leon’s new appearance and how some of Capcom’s beloved characters are getting long in the tooth. “Uncle Leon, at the very least, I would like for you to live happily in your old age,” Kamiya commented, sharing a timelapse of Leon’s aging face. In response, another user wrote that, although they were fine with game characters getting older, they hoped that Resident Evil and Devil May Cry characters could receive the happy ending they deserve. Replying to this, Kamiya mused: “Even if Dante became happy, won’t he always be poor?”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">レオンおじさん…せめて老後は幸せに暮らして欲しい… <a href="https://t.co/EzsvnVHp54" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/EzsvnVHp54</a></p>— 神谷英樹🍀 Hideki Kamiya🍀 (@HidekiKamiya_X) <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1999371106193703131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem’s devs have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-developers-reveal-how-much-well-play-as-leon-and-say-the-survival-horroraction-contrast-is-like-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna"><u>already revealed</u></a> that switching between playing as Grace and Leon will be like “jumping into a cold bath after a hot sauna,” such is the contrast between the tense survival horror sneaking and Leon’s no-holds-barred action. According to director Akifumi Nakanishi, there will be an almost equal split between newcomer Grace and fan favorite Leon. "Although he’s a character who carries a lot on his shoulders, we took a lot of care in refining him into an 'ikeoji',” Nakanishi concluded. "The reactions to the trailer on that front have made us happy (laughs).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.
