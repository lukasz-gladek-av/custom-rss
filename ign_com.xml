            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Play an in-game month with most of the gameplay systems in place.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Management sim Esports Manager 2026, from developer Neurona Games and publishing platform indie.io, just released a new demo on Steam that gives an in-depth look at the systems that will be present in the final game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you could probably guess from the name, the game puts you in the role of a manager of an esports organization and challenges you to lead it to victory. The demo focuses on the three key systems that define the gameplay: talent acquisition, management of staff and players, and match simulation.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/ss-8230edeea63e7deee47edfa8b1f742ed03bc67de-1920x1080-1764973274573.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can create your own organization from scratch or take control of a real esports organization, like EternalFire, Copenhagen Wolves, M80, and GamerLegion, and additional teams will be added when the game fully releases. And with the Transfer Module, you can scout, buy, and sell players, including real-life players like <a href="https://x.com/neLendirekt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@neLendirekt</u></a><u>,</u> <a href="https://x.com/BanKsEsports" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@BanKsEsports</u></a><u>,</u> <a href="https://x.com/PiNGCasts" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@PiNGCasts</u></a><u>,</u> <a href="https://x.com/bit1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@bit1</u></a>, and many more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player has ratings in several different categories. Some define their technical gaming ability, like their skill with different weapon types or how clutch they are. Others define their personality, like leadership, amicability, and loyalty. And still others define their physical attributes, like eyesight, reaction time, and endurance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll be competing with other organizations for their services, negotiating contracts and building a roster that best aligns with your current goal. Timing and market conditions will affect these negotiations, so your strategy might need to change as circumstances do. And you’ll need to balance your income, expenses, and sponsorships to keep your organization from going bankrupt.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/ss-26db38347b8fcfd4dfc17bac991af74122c430ea-1920x1080-1764973296841.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’ve built your team, you can use the Talk Module to communicate directly with your players and staff members to manage their growth, morale, and relationships. You set training plans to improve players’ skills, but you also need to keep an eye on their well-being and how they’re feeling. You don’t want to overwork them or wear them down. You’ll also need to monitor how your players and staff members feel about each other and resolve any conflicts that might come up. It’s all part of the nitty gritty of running an organization; it’s not always sunshine and rainbows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it wouldn’t be an esports team without the actual esports. Using the Simulation Module, you’ll take the team you’ve built into tournaments, where you can watch it perform in semi-3D simulated matches. Will all your hard work pay off in a tournament win? Or will it be clear you need to develop your team more? There’s no way to know until you actually see them in action. And with the Tactic Creator, you can design and test strategies that you can use during simulations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These systems make up the core gameplay loop of Esports Manager 2026, and about 70% of the final systems are present in the demo. The demo doesn’t limit the real-life amount of time you can play it, but it is limited to one in-game month. That’s plenty of time to go through the full process of creating your manager profile, choosing a team, building your roster, communicating with players, signing up for a tournament, and going through simulated matches.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/ss-56e08dc15e864c548deeb239ab7187ecf86fd4b7-1920x1080-1764973253420.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While most of the core gameplay is there, the developers have also made it clear that more is on the way. In particular, match simulations will be significantly expanded and more complex, with added options for tactical control and in-game events. And, of course, everything that’s present in the demo will be further balanced and polished between now and release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the full game, the demo is meant to be replayed to test out new strategies and experience more of what it has to offer. And it should give you a pretty accurate idea of the scope of the final game. The demo is available to download <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2749950/Esports_Manager_2026/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>on Steam</u></a> now, and if you want to get the latest updates, you can follow Esports Manager 2026 on <a href="https://x.com/EManagerGame" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Twitter</u></a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/esportsmanager" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Discord</u></a>.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/esports-manager-2026-drops-new-demo-on-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is thawing out the Infinity Blade, arguably the game's most controversial weapon ever, for an appearance in the next season of its OG battle royale mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beginning this Thursday, December 11, Fortnite OG will shift to Chapter 1 Season 7, and let players experience the game's beloved retro season where all the snow turned up and we got to fly around in planes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a brilliant season, though one that will go down in Fortnite history as one of the most divisive — as Epic Games also introduced the Mythic-quality Infinity Blade sword that was notoriously overpowered. Only one Infinity Blade spawned each match, and lobbies turned into an absolute mess over who nabbed the game-breaking item first.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I remember enjoying the brief disruption to the game's meta, which was turned on its head and has never seen anything quite like it since (perhaps for good reason). Because, after significant outcry, the Infinity Blade was made unplayable and literally frozen into its pedestal after only a few days, never to be used again — until now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games has not said when it intends to unvault the Infinity Blade, or for how long. It's possible the weapon will be offered at full strength for a brief period, or it could have been rebalanced — for now, players have been left to speculate. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/download-1765214757064.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite OG's Chapter 1 Season 7 announcement. Image credit: Epic Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, at least, players can expect everything else the original Chapter 1 Season 7 featured to arrive later this week, including items such as balloons and the ability to redeploy your glider, negating fall damage, as well as the fan-favorite X-4 Stormwing planes. Fresh areas of the map include Polar Peak — home to the Ice King, the cheery Happy Hamlet and the Frosty Flights airbase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remixed outfits include the feline-tailed Lynx (later the love interest for swole cat Meowscles), onesie-wearing character Onesie, and Fortnite's battle-scarred take on Father Christmas himself: Sergeant Winter. Is the game really giving up its opportunity to reskin The Ice King? For now, it seems so — though rumors have suggested we may be seeing more of him in the near future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is, as always, a busy time for Fortnite — which recently launched its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-seven-art-teases-lego-ninjago-fans-say-and-return-of-the-cube">big new Chapter 7 update for the game's main Battle Royale and Zero Build modes</a>. The game also recently played host to a major Kill Bill crossover, where players could watch Tarantino's new animated sequence inserted into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/kill-bill-the-whole-bloody-affair">Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</a>. And just last night, we learned that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/percy-jackson-is-headed-to-fortnite">Percy Jackson was also coming to the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
