            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Please give me a real-life Froggy Chair, PLEASE.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">If Animal Crossing: New Horizons' 3.0 update earlier this month wasn't enough for you, don't worry, there's a new hype train you can board. IKEA just recently posted a TikTok with some very familiar sights and sounds, and it has us hoping for a furniture collaboration soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-ikea-collab/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a>, the official TikTok page for IKEA France <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ikeafrance/video/7597860813692472608?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-93JTvzdyqdS" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a video</a> two days ago that very much seems to be teasing something Animal Crossing-related. In the video, a very distinctively Animal Crossing leaf floats down from the ceiling of an empty room, before a hand cursor clicks on it and turns it into furniture, cycling through four different types of IKEA furniture (two bookcases in different styles, a dresser, and a couch). The video description, via TikTok's translation from French, reads, "We still don't accept cash bells. #ikea #animalcrossing"</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@ikeafrance/video/7597860813692472608" data-video-id="7597860813692472608"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ikeafrance?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="@ikeafrance" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ikeafrance</a> On n'accepte toujours pas les clochettes en caisse. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/ikea?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="ikea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ikea</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/animalcrossing?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="animalcrossing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#animalcrossing</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/son-original-IKEA-France-7597860865366412064?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="♬ son original  - IKEA France" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ son original  - IKEA France</a> </section> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The background music, while not identifiable immediately as any specific Animal Crossing theme, certainly has the correct xylophone and according sounds going. And the sound effects of clicking and cycling between furniture are 100% straight from Animal Crossing. To me, that reads that whatever's going on here at minimum has Nintendo's blessing.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/23/screenshot-2026-01-24-09-49-28-1769201445843.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image courtesy of KBABZ</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, IKEA and Nintendo have collaborated on Animal Crossing stuff before. Five years ago, <a href="https://animalcrossingworld.com/2020/08/ikea-creates-amazing-animal-crossing-new-horizons-themed-furniture-catalog/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IKEA Taiwan recreated one of its print catalog</a> using nothing but screenshots from Animal Crossing: New Horizons. IKEA has also done proper in-game collaborations with games like The Sims in the past, so it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to see something like IKEA furniture in Animal Crossing, or Animal Crossing furniture sold at IKEA. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, I'm all on board of this means we get Blåhaj in Animal Crossing, or a real-life Froggy Chair. We'll keep our eyes peeled for any sort of official confirmation.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, we're still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-big-30-update-just-dropped-a-day-early">having plenty of fun with the big 3.0 update</a> and all the fun new stuff that's been added...well, almost all of it. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/12-player-animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-a-nightmare-because-nintendo-handles-online-functionality-in-the-most-ridiculous-way-possible">12-player co-op seems pretty fraught</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Queen’s Blood fans, it's time to celebrate. The addictive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a> card game is making a “powered-up” comeback for the final chapter in Square Enix’s remake trilogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-queens-blood-interview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Polygon</u></a> spoke with director Naoki Hamaguchi about the progress of development on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3</u></a> and touched on the topic of one of the more popular virtual pastimes of 2024. He says he plans to double down on the card game when its next installment finally launches, promising to “expand” what was seen with its Rebirth launch.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Queen’s Blood is a very popular and beloved minigame, and I believe a lot of people are still wanting something like that,” Hamaguchi said. “I want to expand on Queen’s Blood so that we are enhancing it, and giving you a more powered-up version of it when you see that third installment… Queen’s Blood is still going to be available in the third installment. We just want to expand on it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The director declines to share exactly what a spruced-up version of Queen’s Blood will look like, but it’s easy to imagine an expansion of new cards and new side-quests shaking up the gameplay. However, Hamaguchi’s comments suggest players may be in for a somewhat substantial upgrade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hamaguchi adds that the original Final Fantasy 7 mini-game featuring snowboarding is also coming back for Remake Part 3. He teases that “it’s not going to be just a simple snowboarding minigame,” adding that it will be incorporated into the story and its themes, but stops short of providing more details.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy is jam-packed with a variety of mini-games to keep Cloud and company’s fight against Sephiroth from getting too serious, but most fans are just looking forward to seeing how the retelling will finally finish its story. Hamaguchi and the rest of the Square Enix team is far from ready to share a release date, but he says development is at least “coming along very smoothly.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have set a schedule for ourselves, and I believe we are tracking on time for the milestones we have set,” Hamaguchi adds. “So I’m really thankful for the development team and I have so much respect for them working on this project. I believe that at this point the game is playable, technically, but we are still trying to polish it so it is at a quality where we can deliver it to our players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a round of positive updates for Final Fantasy Remake Part 3, which arrives just shy of the two-year anniversary of the launch of Rebirth.
