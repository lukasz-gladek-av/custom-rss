Perhaps, then, we’ll see it at this week’s Indie World Showcase, just announced by Nintendo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Indie World Showcase is set for this Thursday, August 7 at 6am PT / 2pm UK time, Nintendo announced. Expect 15 minutes of new announcements and updates on indie games coming to Nintendo Switch 2 and the OG Nintendo Switch.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1952716473656385840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The showcase comes hot on the heels of last month's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-everything-announced">Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase</a>, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-react-in-uproar-after-the-games-latest-nintendo-direct-no-show">Silksong’s infamous fanbase struggled to cope with</a> after yet another no-show.

It’s done the Partner Direct, and now this Indie showcase is confirmed. What about a proper Nintendo Direct? Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Kirby Air Riders — both still down for 2025 — aren't going to promote themselves. And how about that 3D Mario game, Nintendo?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
