This tool unleashes a herd of flaming horses that "charge forward, leaving a burning trail behind them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’ve always wanted a burning tool that works like Altan’s Bracelets, and the year of the fire horse provided the perfect creative spark," the team teased. "Plus, when you talk about Persian culture, you have to talk about the horse!

The "Breathless" update is slated to arrive with a public beta at the end of March, promising a "quicker and more intense" experience. This includes a rework of the game's first hour, tighter pacing and improvements to when and how you unlock new game content and new mechanics, as well as changes to bosses' difficulty.

As you can guess from its title, this update means making the whole experience quicker and more intense, leaving you... breathless!</blockquote><blockquote>We have done a big rework of the pacing of the <strong>first hour,</strong> including when and how you will unlock new game content and new mechanics, as well as the bosses’ difficulty. Reworks of the level design of the first few biomes will also highlight our iconic wall-run move and make each biome <strong>quicker and tougher</strong>.</blockquote><blockquote>For <strong>veteran </strong>players who have been looking forward to new toys to play with, don't worry, we've got you covered! First up, we're introducing a new element - <strong>freeze </strong>– which is coming with a new weapon, the slingshot!</blockquote><blockquote>Next on the list is the <strong>arenas </strong>– zones that lock you in, and the only way out is to defeat wave after wave of enemies!</blockquote><blockquote>Most importantly, <strong>weapon affixes </strong>are coming too!! These affixes will make each weapon that appears in your run much more interesting and varied, giving you some difficult choices to take...</blockquote><blockquote><strong>End Game Update</strong></blockquote><blockquote>That's it for the first update, let's quickly talk about the <strong>second one!</strong></blockquote><blockquote>We're planning for it to land in early May, and some of the content may change, but we know what we'd like to do... It will focus on the End Game, plus bringing more challenges like Speed Run mode and Daily Awakening.</blockquote><blockquote>You'll be able to really test your skill and push the limit with this update coming! Speed, precision, and strategy—show us what you've got.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>From 2025 to 2026</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Looking back on 2025</strong>, it was a big year for The Rogue Prince of Persia. We finally graduated from Early Access and increased the game’s <strong>Steam review score from 70%</strong> upon Early Access release to 88% so far with your support and help!</blockquote><blockquote>Of course, we're not just on Steam, we’ve also successfully brought the game to Switch, Xbox, and Playstation! Right now, we are almost at the point of having<strong> 1 million people</strong> who've played our game!</blockquote><blockquote>Even though we are only in the second month of 2026, the game has already achieved something else: we have been included in the <strong>Bafta awards longlist and gained 4 nominations at the french game awards ceremony PEGASUS</strong>, including best game. We’re crossing all the fingers and toes we have until March.</blockquote><blockquote>Following the awards season, <strong>vinyl and physical collector editions</strong> are also on the way! We believe it will be a great year for the rogue prince of persia, and we can’t wait to make this game better with you guys in 2026!</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure"><u>Ubisoft began this year by announcing a sizable company restructure, resulting in the cancelation of six games</u></a>, including its Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake, and a delay to a further seven titles.

"A cancelation so close to release can be particularly devastating for younger team members who don't have decades of past shipped titles on their resumé," he said. "It's tough to suddenly absorb that the past four years of hard work you were proud of, and looking forward to seeing out in the world as your new calling card, will now never see daylight."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
