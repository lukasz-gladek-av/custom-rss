            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has added a number of new games to Xbox Game Pass today as part of a major shakeup that has seen the Ultimate tier increase in price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As IGN has reported, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-rises-to-30-a-month-microsoft-adds-more-day-one-games-and-throws-in-fortnite-crew-and-ubisoft-classics-to-help-justify-the-cost">Microsoft has hiked the price of Ultimate from $19.99 to $29.99 a month</a>, while renaming and upgrading the other tiers. As part of the justification for the price rise, Microsoft added Ubisoft+ Classics for the first time ever to Ultimate, and the games that are part of that subscription are now a part of Ultimate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, Warner Bros.’ smash hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> is now available across Ultimate and the new Premium tier (which replaces Standard), but it’s not in the new Essential tier (which replaces Core).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Premium gets more than 40 new games available today, including Blizzard’s action role-playing game Diablo 4 and the aforementioned Hogwarts Legacy. Microsoft said Premium gets new Xbox-published games within a year of their launch, but, interestingly, that excludes Call of Duty titles. So don't expect to play Black Ops 7 day one as a Premium subscriber when it comes out this November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Essential, meanwhile, is a curated catalog of over 50 games playable on both console and PC. The Essential library is now fully playable on PC, featuring games like Hades, Cities: Skylines – Remastered, Stardew Valley, and Warhammer 40,000: Darktide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the full
