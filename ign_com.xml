            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-meat-boy">Super Meat Boy</a>, the hard-as-nails platforming classic where dying dozens of times per level comes as standard, has now been played from start to finish in a perfect run. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been 15 years since Super Meat Boy originally released for Xbox 360, and it has taken all of those 15 years for someone to pull off this frankly astonishing feat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Step up <a href="https://youtu.be/zb7bnhmqT3s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shredberg</a>, a Nintendo speedrunner with a particular soft spot for Super Meat Boy, who livestreamed his deathless completion of the game just before the end of 2025. The achievement quickly drew congratulations from Edmund McMillen, the game's co-creator, who dubbed shredberg as "awesome" for being the one who finally managed it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For anyone who's played and struggled with Super Meat Boy over the years, particularly its later levels which simply look impossible when you first see them, it's hard to not watch the full <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7bnhmqT3s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> of shredberg's run and be impressed at the calm way he leaps, slops and slides around each level just pixels away from sawblades, meat grinders and explosions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Let's go," shredberg said calmly, upon completing Super Meat Boy's final level after more than 2000 attempts and over 1000 hours of gameplay. "Let's go dude! I cannot believe it, I've been doing this too long. I got to go to work tomorrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'll be honest, I'm not going to say I wasn't nervous, because I was very nervous at the end there... but I was way more nervous just in Dark Cotton," he continued, referencing an earlier level. "Once I got past Dark Hell 2, I was relatively fine. I got super nervous whenever I had any minor slip-up."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 25 Xbox 360 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm going to be emailing everyone," shredberg added. "Kotaku, IGN, CNN, Chef's Illustrated, they're all going to hear about it. I will unironically email IGN."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the years, Super Meat Boy has launched on every major console from Nintendo Switch to PlayStation Vita, though no one else has managed this feat — something many players thought was impossible. A sequel to the game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-meat-boy-forever">Super Meat Boy Forever</a>, launched in 2020. Next up for the series is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-meat-boy-3d">Super Meat Boy 3D</a>, due for launch early this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And for shredberg? The second he completed his run, one viewer had a suggestion for what he should play next. "I have to play Silksong now?" shredberg said, reading the inevitable comment. "Yeah... I'm so glad it's over. Not even in a 'this wasn't even fun' kinda way, because it was. But, man."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
