"A small example is we had an internal hypothesis that far more people would put their console into rest mode than fully shut it down each time between their play sessions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As it turned out, it was actually about 50/50 between the two options for all our players. So, what that meant was for about 50% of our users, when they booted up, if they were in the US, they were landing on our Explore page. Those outside the U.S. would land on the page for the last game that they have played."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Welcome Hub was therefore developed long after the PS5's release for these players who do not use rest mode, something Sony didn't believe necessary until it looked into these stats. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/big-ps5-update-adds-welcome-hub-party-share-and-more-new-features">It arrived in September and essentially lets players customize their homescreen</a> with different widgets and bits of useful information.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pokemon-center-declares-2025-is-the-year-of-eevee<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Forget Year of Luigi. 2025 is the Year of Eevee. At least, according to The Pokémon Center, the official merch arm of The Pokémon Company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/2025-is-the-year-of-eevee-at-the-pokemon-center" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced today</a> via the official Pokémon website, which christened the year by announcing an array of Eevee-themed merchandise such as plush toys and Eeveelution statuettes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, the "Year of Eevee" thus far appears only to impact The Pokémon Center, the official merchandise store for Pokémon. So it's entirely possible this is purely a marketing thing to sell more Eevee plush, and won't impact anything else.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/06/pokemon-center-169-1736187150484.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">2025 is the Year of Eevee according to The Pokémon Center. Image credit: The Pokémon Company.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's <em>also</em> possible this celebration ends up extending to other parts of Pokémon. For instance, we know for a fact that a new Pokémon game is planned for later this year: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. We don't have a ton of information about the game so far, apart from its setting (Lumiose City) and its placement in the "Pokémon Legends" series alongside <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>. A Year of Eevee could portend exciting things for Z-A... dare I predict, a new Eeveelution? There hasn't been one of those since Sylveon was added in Pokémon X and Y (where Lumiose City was introduced) over a decade ago. We're long overdue for a new variation. Unfortunately, we probably can't expect an entirely Eevee-focused game. We've already basically had one of those in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/12/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-and-eevee-review">Pokémon Let's Go! Pikachu and Eevee</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it's worth noting that the Eevee theming has already invaded the Pokémon TCG via the recent Prismatic Evolution expansion. The <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/01/prismatic-evolutions-set-guide-full-card-list-secret-rares-cut-cards-products-and-more" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new expansion</a>, which releases next week, centers around Terastal Pokémon like in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, but notably includes some absolutely gorgeous Eeveelution cards and even features a Terastal on the cover. Every Eeveelution is included in the set in multiple forms, including an Umbreon that <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/whats-the-ceiling-on-pokemons-new-tera-type-moonbreon/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some are predicting</a> will be very, very coveted by collectors.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/06/umbreon-ex-sir-1736186128191.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A new Umbreon ex card is already being <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/602681/pokemon-japan-sv8a-terastal-fest-ex-umbreon-ex-217187">listed online</a> for absurd amounts of money for a single card.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, I'm really hoping this means we'll see some exciting Eevee-themed updates to other games. Pokémon's been juggling quite a few ongoing games lately, including Pokémon Sleep, Pokémon  Unite, Pokémon Masters EX, and of course Pokémon Go. Between all of those, surely there will be room for some interesting Eevee-themed updates over the next year to tie into the merch plays. We'll have to see how far The Pokémon Company chooses to take things while we eagerly away for more news about Pokémon Legends Z-A. Don't forget, Pokémon Day is on February 27!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social.

Those looking for a cheaper option are out of luck, however, as the $6,999 price tag is the cheapest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This gets fans the Pro edition, while the Premium costs $9,699 and the Limited Edition, capped at 740 machines total as an ode to the 1974 release date of D&amp;D, costs $12,999.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Tyrant's Eye</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Tyrant's Eye, at all editions, features a story where players must defeat the Dragon Queen Tiamat and, in true D&amp;D fashion, features different story paths depending on randomly decided outcomes. A star-studded voice cast contributes to the pinball machine, including the aforementioned emo singer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Critical Role's Matthew Mercer, Laura Bailey, and Marisha Ray all appear too, alongside Michael Dorn, Kevin Smith, Luke Gygax, Chris Prynoski, Brendon Small, Anthony Carboni, and Mica Burton. Way's inclusion is perhaps not completely random, as he is a known fan of the tabletop role-playing game and has been for years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Enjoy mysterious and exciting features by navigating through hidden passageways, experience an electromagnet-powered gelatinous cube that freezes the pinball, and explore dynamic dungeon levels that are accessed through a disappearing playfield trap door," the official synopsis reads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Other features include Fizmo’s store that allows players to acquire unique items, a treasure chest that unleashes mimic monsters, and more secrets to uncover." It also includes "the most advanced animatronic mech in pinball" in the form of Rath the red dragon, which "intelligently reacts to player action with multi-axis motion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those able to nab the limited edition can, alongside bragging rights, also enjoy the interactive speaker expression lighting system with D&amp;D sound effects, an exclusive red design, and an autograph from designer Brian Eddy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image Credit: Stern Pinball</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
