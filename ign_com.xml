Nintendo opted to release the game at a price point of $79.99, but you can pick it up for $71.99 at Woot. Mario Kart World features a brand-new open world design that interconnects each of the 30 tracks. A battle royale-like mode called Knockout Tour is hugely popular among players, as it offers a racing experience unlike anything we've seen in Mario Kart before.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch 2 Available at Walmart &amp; Target</h2></div><div catalogid="b6924989-d312-445b-871c-20c712a50785" id="225854"><div id="225854" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 Console + Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> has been quite challenging to find if you didn't secure one at launch, both Target and Walmart have the highly popular console in stock. This is the Mario Kart World bundle, too, which packs in a digital copy of Mario Kart World for $50. The Nintendo Switch 2 is an upgrade to Nintendo Switch in almost every way possible, featuring a 1080p display with a 120Hz refresh rate, improved Joy-Con, and much more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth for $34.99</h2></div><div catalogid="b6924989-d312-445b-871c-20c712a50785" id="225853"><div id="225853" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth - PS5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> was my favorite game of 2024, and it's available for just $34.99 at Woot this weekend. This is the lowest I've seen the PS5 copies so far, and I cannot recommend picking it up enough. Cloud and the rest of the party leave Midgar to step into the open world of Gaia for the very first time, and there is well over 100 hours of content available for you to complete.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pre-Orders are Live for the LEGO Game Boy</h2></div><div catalogid="b6924989-d312-445b-871c-20c712a50785" id="225848"><div id="225848" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Game Boy</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, Nintendo and LEGO <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-game-boy-set-revealed">unveiled the new LEGO Game Boy set</a>.

If you haven't had the chance to check this one out yet, Amazon has copies available for only $34.99. This is by far the definitive way to experience this classic, and now is the perfect time to catch up before Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake this Fall.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save on Breath of the Wild &amp; Tears of the Kingdom for Switch 2</h2></div><div id="225852" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="b6924989-d312-445b-871c-20c712a50785"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Switch 2 Edition</h3></p></div><div catalogid="b6924989-d312-445b-871c-20c712a50785" id="225851"><div id="225851" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Switch 2 Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Woot also has both The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom for Nintendo Switch 2 on sale. These editions pack in both the original game on Nintendo Switch in addition to the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade.
