Indeed, their statement ends with the suggestion that "all the media attention this has received will do something to convince investors" that Shenmue 4 should be made.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I just wanted to set the record straight for all those who think it might still be half real," JustAFan1 wrote. "It's not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I know many of you will want to hang me for dashing your hopes, but know this was not done out of malice, but love for Shenmue. I realize I went about it the wrong way, and I apologize for that. But I hope all the media attention this has received will do something to convince investors that Shenmue is very much alive and profitable if approached correctly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As proof that they were the creator of the video, JustAFan1 posted a link to a new version of the trailer with additional music and footage, along with a lengthier apology statement in both English and Japanese. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I want to be absolutely clear: I am merely a fan of the series and have absolutely no professional or personal affiliation with Ys Net, nor have I ever had any," this statement reads. "The creation and release of the trailer, which presented itself as an official piece of promotional material recorded behind the scenes, was a lapse in judgment. I take full responsibility for this action."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shenmue 3 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">JustAFan1's statement continues by confirming that the fake trailer's story elements were made using publicly available lore and common fan theories about where the Shenmue series might progress in future, with nothing that specifically reflected any real development that may or may not be underway within Ys Net. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While my intent was centered on a positive outcome, the method I chose to achieve it was misleading and unprofessional. I deeply regret creating and sharing information that was not factual, and I understand the negative impact this misinformation had.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The sole purpose behind creating the 'Shenmue 4' trailer was to demonstrate the sustained and substantial market demand and community enthusiasm for this beloved series," the video statement concludes. "I meant no harm to Ys Net, its brand, or its loyal fans. My motivation was to champion the series and help encourage its continuation, not to mislead or create distress."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction to the statement has been mostly supportive, with many agreeing that the trailer had created fresh buzz for the franchise amid hope for confirmation of a new game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nah, you're good," fan hyo_razuki replied. "I knew it was fake from the beginning but it was fun and you generated some enthusiasm for Shenmue, so no biggie, no need to apologize."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of now, it's unknown if a fourth major Shenmue game will ever get made, though the franchise's fans certainly hope it happens. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yu-suzuki-talks-shenmue-4-air-twister-and-40-years-of-game-development">Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki told IGN in 2023 that he wanted to create a fourth game at some point</a>, though he is currently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shenmue-3-enhanced-announced-as-most-refined-version-of-ryo-hazukis-epic-journey">still working on an enhanced version of Shenmue 3</a>. This, Suzuki hopes, will win the game a warmer reception across a wider set of platforms, after a middling response to Shenmue 3 at the game's initial launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead is working on a roguelite mode, the studio’s boss has revealed, although there's no guarantee it will actually come out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead CCO and Helldivers 2 creative director, Johan Pilestedt, responded to a fan on social media <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1998824312401187274" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to say</a> “we have a prototype of a roguelite mode — it changes the game fundamentally!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That casual reveal has already set fans of the explosive co-op action shooter into overdrive imagining how a roguelite mode would work in the game, which revolves around open and shut missions restricted by time limits.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Going to be us defending the Evac from endless patrols but the bird never shows up,” suggested one fan. “Wave complete. Choose a booster to add: Reinforcement budget, flexible budget, discount budget (reinforcing multiple teammates takes up only one call in),” suggested another. And here’s another take: “I think it would be cool to add that… a mission that has no helldiver limit, or no time limit with a limited amount of reinforcements… and just defend a fort from wave after wave of enemies, and we get rewarded based off of how many waves of enemies we can eliminate before time runs out, or the amount of reinforcements runs out…”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth pointing out that Pilestedt has only so far confirmed that a prototype for this mode has been built, so it may never come to fruition. But given Pilestedt mentioned it in a post on social media — already viewed over 120,000 times — you’d like to think the developers are confident it will eventually see the light of day.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Helldivers 2: Python Commandos Premium Warbond Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Clearly, Arrowhead will continue to update the game for some time to come. Helldivers 2 is just coming off its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-patch-500-arrives-with-an-incoming-message-from-high-command-thats-already-got-players-worried"><u>big 5.0.0 patch</u></a> as well as its jungle-themed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-finally-getting-a-minigun-and-other-fan-requested-weapons-as-part-of-the-jungle-themed-python-commandos-warbond"><u>Python Commandos Warbond</u></a>, which adds a number of fan-requested weapons including a minigun. In September, the studio’s CEO confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/think-runescape-arrowhead-ceo-rules-out-helldivers-3-will-keep-updating-helldivers-2-for-as-long-as-it-can-go">Helldivers 3 is not in any plan developer Arrowhead has right now</a>, saying that instead it wants Helldivers 2 to keep going for years and years, like veteran MMO RuneScape. And then there’s the Helldivers 2 movie, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-ceo-responds-to-call-for-the-helldivers-movie-director-to-play-the-game-at-least-once">which is picking up steam</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a subsequent tweet, Pilestedt posted a picture of a meeting with the Helldivers 2 directors to discuss the game's next four arcs, which one fan joked would take a few years to work through. Of course there will be plenty more coming to the game in between.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative Assembly has confirmed it has a new Total War video game set to be announced at The Game Awards, but what is it? Warhammer 40,000 fans think they know — and one eagle-eyed viewer even spotted what looks like concrete evidence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sega-owned strategy specialist behind Total War: Warhammer (the fantasy version of Games Workshop's much-loved tabletop setting) is rumored to be working on a Warhammer 40,000 and a Star Wars take on its long-running Total War series, and it looks like the Warhammer 40,000 game will finally get announced at The Game Awards tonight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Redditor Knavbot took to the Total War subreddit to point to a blink-and-you’ll miss it reference to 40K in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-announced-at-creative-assemblys-total-war-25th-anniversary-showcase">Creative Assembly’s recent showcase livestream</a> (the one where the developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/total-war-medieval-3-announced-as-the-rebirth-of-historical-total-war-new-total-war-game-to-be-revealed-at-the-game-awards">announced Total War: Medieval 3</a>). I really do mean blink-and-you'll miss it because the files labeled 40k are incredibly hard to spot. I had to slow the video right down at the 32:42 mark and freeze-frame to see them, but yes, they are there:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/11/screenshot-2025-12-11-105045-1765451587355.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">40k file names in Creative Assembly's showcase video. Image credit: Creative Assembly / YouTube.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are the relevant file names in the video:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>40k_outfield_sheet_01_base_colour</li><li>40k_outfield_sheet_01_material_map</li><li>40k_outfield_sheet_01_normal</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">This apparent 40k leak appeared during the part of the showcase where Creative Assembly talked about its new game engine, which will help bring its games to consoles for the first time. Assuming this is all leading to a Total War: Warhammer 40,000 announcement, we can assume the game will release for PC as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, the announcement won’t come as much of a surprise for many Warhammer 40,000 fans given the sheer volume of rumors floating around Creative Assembly and the Games Workshop community in recent months. But until the game is announced, we should point out that the Total War reveal at The Game Awards could be something else entirely.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000 video game leaks have a history of coming from file names shown in videos.
