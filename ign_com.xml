            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo will discontinue its Switch Game Vouchers scheme, which currently allows Nintendo Switch Online subscribers to buy Switch 1 games at a discount.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Detailing its plans in a lengthy <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Nintendo-Switch-Game-Vouchers-FAQ-1560656.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ page</a> published today, the company said Switch Game Vouchers would be ditched as of January 30, 2026 — meaning fans still have six months should they still wish to buy more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">No reason has been given for the scheme's ending, though it follows Nintendo's decision not to allow vouchers to be redeemed for Switch 2 software, and after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-isnt-the-only-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-costs-80-some-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-do-as-well">the launch of Nintendo's first-ever $80 game</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers were first introduced in 2019, and offer a flat purchase price for two Nintendo Switch games bought within a 12-month period. In the UK, this price is set at £84, meaning you pay an average of £42 for a game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This typically represents an £8 saving per game from the standard £50 Switch game RRP — and an even greater saving on the select games that Nintendo prices at £60: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And while Nintendo has not extended the scheme to Switch 2 games, fans have realised they can still use vouchers to buy the original, Switch 1 versions of games with paid Switch 2 upgrades, such as Zelda: Breath of the Wild, offering a cheaper method of obtaining those too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, Switch 2 owners can currently buy a pair of Switch Game Vouchers and redeem them to play cross-generational games such as Metroid Prime: Beyond, or the upcoming Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which is due for launch in October. Z-A is priced at the usual £50 for Switch 1, or £60 for its Switch 2 Edition. Buy it using a Game Voucher,  and you can still get the £8 saving for Z-A's Switch 1 edition, before simply paying the £10 upgrade fee to access the Switch 2 Edition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As ever, Switch Game Vouchers must be redeemed within 12 months after purchase, though Nintendo has said that additional Switch titles will continue to be added to the Game Voucher catalogue throughout 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa recently suggested that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-game-development-risks-increasing-due-to-higher-game-prices-and-rising-production-costs-suggests-shorter-development-periods-as-one-solution">the company was now exploring shorter game development cycles for some projects</a> to help keep its costs down, and avoid pricing games too highly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Absolutely no horsing around.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Japanese developer Cygames <a href="https://umamusume.jp/visitingstables_guidelines/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>published a list of rules</u></a> for fans wanting to visit the real-life horses behind the characters in its anime racehorse-girl management game Umamusume: Pretty Derby, which got a <a href="https://umamusume.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>long-awaited global release</u></a> this June.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, anime racehorse-girl management game, you heard that right. In the world of Umamusume: Pretty Derby, racehorses are reborn as cute anime girls, complete with equine ears and tails. The franchise started off in 2018 as an anime, followed by a Japan-only release of the mobile game in 2021. In the game, players can talk to, train and manage horse-girls like Special Week and Mejiro McQueen, sharing in their triumphs and losses. As a result, the Umamusume franchise has inspired a cult following, and apparently many fans have become interested in the real-life Japanese racehorses behind their favorite characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, in their enthusiasm, it seems that some fans may have caused distress to their favorites and their owners in real life. As previously reported by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/umamusume-pretty-derby-devs-urge-fans-to-not-pester-real-life-racehorses-3224393/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Dexerto</u></a>, Cygames shared guidelines for those who want to visit real-life racehorses in Japan, reminding people that you can’t just rock up to a ranch and that horses are easily startled by loud noises and camera flashes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 9-point guideline was created by the <a href="https://uma-furusato.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Racehorse's Hometown Information Center</u></a>. The first two points urge would-be visitors to check with the center for tour availability and to confirm tour times before visiting. The rules also remind visitors to follow the instructions of ranch staff at all times, to refrain from smoking on-site, and not to enter stables or pastures without permission. The rest of the rules are centered on the horses’ wellbeing — don’t make loud noises and refrain from touching, feeding or taking flash photography of the horses.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/10/image005-1752142593002.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Umamusume: Pretty Derby's English language launch has exploded.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Cygames has been fostering strong connections to the Japanese horse racing world — it often shows up alongside and provides support for racehorse-related exhibits at events in Japan, and has donated to the Retired Racehorse Association of Japan (source: <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20240304-27999/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>). As part of promotions for the mobile game’s global, English-language release, Cygames looked stateside, <a href="https://www.cygames.co.jp/en/news/id-24322" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>partnering with the Kentucky Derby</u></a> back in May and setting up a booth where people could play the demo of Umamusume Pretty Derby.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are interested in seeing what all the fuss is about, Umamusume: Pretty Derby is available now in English via Steam, Google Play, and the Apple App store. All three seasons of the anime are currently on Crunchyroll.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.
