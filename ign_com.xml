Even if you don't recognize the name, you'll recognize his work – Amano is the artist behind the iconic artwork for the Final Fantasy series. This is no coincidence, as the team behind Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and most notably the Studio Co-Founder, François Meurisse, confirmed in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-builds-on-a-heritage-of-jrpgs-like-final-fantasy-7-8-9-and-10-but-its-also-inspired-by-sekiro-and-taking-pieces-from-deckbuilders/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a> that they were heavily inspired by the Final Fantasy franchise when creating Expedition 33.

The problem is with cheaper cards is the lower transfer speeds, which add up on more demanding games. Getting a Samsung P9 ensures 800MB/s, with Samsung having a great reputation for storage products in general.</p></div><p id="asrock-steel-legend-radeon-rx-9070-x"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="ASRock Steel Legend Radeon RX 9070 X">ASRock Steel Legend Radeon RX 9070 XT</h2></p><div catalogid="217899fe-95e3-424b-9754-79344b27a39a" id="230281"><div id="230281" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>16GB GDDR6 PCI Express 5.0 x16</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>ASRock Steel Legend Radeon RX 9070 XT</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Want something that performs around the same as a RTX 5070Ti without the price tag to go with it? AMD is slowly clawing back its GPU market share by targeting mid-range gamers, but the RX 9070 XT is a brilliant graphics card. Whilst I can run something like Oblivion Remastered at 4K 60FPS all day long on it, I get a lot more joy from it playing at 1440P and getting twice the frame rate instead. This is well worth the money if you're in the market for a new GPU.</p></div><p id="ibuypower-y40-pro-rtx-5080-gaming-pc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="iBuypower Y40 Pro RTX 5080 Gaming PC">iBuypower Y40 Pro RTX 5080 Gaming PC</h2></p><div catalogid="217899fe-95e3-424b-9754-79344b27a39a" id="230282"><div id="230282" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>AMD Ryzen 9 7900X, 32GB DDR5 RAM, 2TB M.2 SSD</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>iBuypower Y40 Pro RTX 5080 Gaming PC</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">RTX 5080 has claimed it place as the sweet spot on the Nvidia 5000 series GPU lineup. It'll play anything in 4K with dedicated ray tracing support, and has DLSS4 technology to insert AI frames and resolution upgrades to fall back on. Ryzen 9 7900X is also a solid processor to back up the 5080, with a max turbo of 5.6GHz and rocking 12 cores, 24 threads and 64mb of L2 cache. Long story short? It's a cracking rig for under $2,000.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Up To 50% off Pokémon TCG</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might want to check if your <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwZN0?object_uuid=09d4a5f3-ba44-4b7c-a7fc-f05441c52d8e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AMEX</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/av3OE0?object_uuid=09d4a5f3-ba44-4b7c-a7fc-f05441c52d8e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Discovery</a> is eligible for up to 50% off Pokémon TCG on Amazon right now.
