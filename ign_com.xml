            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-direct-acknowledges-long-standing-meme-by-repeatedly-throwing-penguin-off-cliffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Mario Kart World Direct, we got a closer look at a number of new tracks, features, and racers, including Penguin. We've known Penguin was in the game since its reveal last week, but today's Direct decided to feature this blue cutie in a very meme-specific way...by repeatedly throwing him off cliffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This happened not once, but <em>twice</em> during the Direct, as fans have pointed out on social media. On one occasion, Penguin simply misjudges a curve and sails neatly off over an icy landscape:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Even Nintendo is deliberately dropping blue penguins off of icy ledges.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioKartWorld?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarioKartWorld</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioKartWorldDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarioKartWorldDirect</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nintendo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Nintendo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Switch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Switch2</a> <a href="https://t.co/0eMsUE24Jz" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/0eMsUE24Jz</a></p>â€” Jonathan Leung (@VGMaps) <a href="https://twitter.com/VGMaps/status/1912876504939180190?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">But in a second, even more on the nose move, a Penguin in Free Roam drives straight off a cliff into the sea below while music from Super Mario 64 toodles away in the background:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">29 years later and we still chucking penguins off of cliffs like in Mario 64<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioKartWorld?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarioKartWorld</a> <a href="https://t.co/7klPg5rZkM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/7klPg5rZkM</a></p>â€” ðŸ”¥FireShadow64ðŸ”¥(DROP THE PRICE) (@FireShadow64) <a href="https://twitter.com/FireShadow64/status/1912862828089770470?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">If you're confused as to why this is noteworthy, allow me to draw your attention to a long-standing community meme of Penguin from Super Mario 64. In Super Mario 64, players discovered years ago that it was possible to collect a Power Star from Mother Penguin by returning Baby Penguin to her, then to take Baby Penguin after the star appears and take them away again...or even drop them off a cliff:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bit has been memed into fame for over a decade by the Mario community, so it's extremely funny to see Nintendo acknowledge it even if it's in a somewhat subtle, plausible-deniability kind of way. Is this a horrendous thing to do? Society still hasn't come down cleanly on one side or another of the Penguin-cliff debate. At least Mario Kart World gives Penguin a nice little water vehicle so they can just keep going once they've landed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's Mario Kart Nintendo Direct wasn't exactly the font of new information many were hoping it would be, but we still got word on some interesting new stuff: more new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-direct-reveals-new-and-returning-courses-even-more-characters">characters, courses</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-coolest-new-features-explained-items-tricks-food-modes-and-more">items, and features</a>, as well as a close look (courtesy of Penguin and others) of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-free-roam-mode-is-an-open-world-road-trip-you-can-take-with-friends">new open world Free Roam</a> mode, which will let players drive around anywhere in the world without restraint.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-direct-everything-announced-for-the-switch-2-launch-title">everything announced right here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/snowbreak-containment-zone-update-adds-new-events-and-gameplay-enhancements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The free-to-play 3D waifu sci-fi RPG shooter Snowbreak: Containment Zone just dropped its latest update, and it adds lots of new content. There are new characters, skins, gameplay modes, and even more on the horizon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If youâ€™re not familiar with Snowbreak, itâ€™s a third-person RPG shooter on PC and mobile that takes place in a world where giant beings known as Titans suddenly appear in heavily populated areas. They cause untold destruction and leave a toxic substance known as Titagen in their wake. Leaders joined together to form the Heimdall Force, a paramilitary unit whose mission is to fight back against these Titans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as the Adjutant of the Heimdall Force, and your job is to recruit and lead a squad of female super soldiers. Known as Manifestations, these soldiers awakened to their powers after the first arrival of the Titans, and the strongest among them are even able to use Titagen in combat without the ill effects normally associated with it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/fight-1744401193210.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The story is told in chapters, with each chapter further broken down into stages. In each combat stage, you form a squad of three characters, each of whom have their own unique skills. You only control one character on the battlefield at a time, and using their skills drains energy, which slowly refills over time. So you need to strategically swap between each of your characters to make the best use of their abilities without fully draining their energy. As you progress, you can build relationships with members of your squad by giving them gifts or deploying them in combat. As their affinity for you grows, youâ€™ll get to know them better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest update adds a new story scenario called Abyssal Dawn, which will have you investigating an incident with the two characters who are also new additions in the update: Nerida and Nita - Pulse.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/nerida-1744401232522.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nerida is self-demanding, often solitary, and can be stern with others but not to you. She likes sweet snacks, plushies, and ancient marine life models, and sheâ€™s obsessed with deep-sea documentaries and jellyfish care. Sheâ€™s equipped with a Chaos-type assault rifle, and her role is the primary damage dealer of your squad. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">She excels with both single-target and area-of-effect attacks and can build up the Internal Injury effect on enemies with both her Standard Skill and Ultimate, which summons a jellyfish that provides AoE damage buffs and stays on the field even if you switch to another character. You can then switch back to her to use her Standard Skill, which deals big burst damage by consuming the Internal Injury effect youâ€™ve built up.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/nita-pulse-1744401268347.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nita - Pulse is casual yet perceptive, driven by money but protective of the vulnerable. While sheâ€™s on the battlefield, she keeps her eyes peeled for items of value and likes to pocket them, like Titagen objects. She wields a Thermal-type shotgun and brings a new QTE combat mechanic with her. Successfully chain QTE inputs together during her Standard Skill to deal increased damage, and if you fully complete the chain, she unleashes a final powerful strike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nita - Pulse is free to acquire for all players, available now by completing the Pulse Puzzles event. Sheâ€™ll also be available for free as a login reward during the Nitaâ€™s Invitation event that starts May 1. If you participate in that event, youâ€™ll also be able to earn Nitaâ€™s fully modified exclusive weapon, maxed Auctus Drive (her version of a Manifestation), and signature fixed-talent Logistics squad. So in one event, you can max out her full build at no cost.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/nitas-invitation-event-1744401305118.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If youâ€™re wondering what the Pulse Puzzles event is, thatâ€™s another new addition with the latest update. As the name implies, itâ€™ll have you solve puzzles across various parts of the game. Itâ€™s a chance to relax and better understand Nita, and it will be permanently available, so you can do it at your own pace. To get to know Nita even more, thereâ€™s also a new interactable scene with her called Grove of Secrets thatâ€™s available from now until May 29.<br>
</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/nita-sylvan-spirit-1744401345665.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nita - Pulse and Nerida were both introduced alongside additional skins. Nitaâ€™s transforms her into a white-haired forest nymph, and Neridaâ€™s features interchangeable parts, including footwear and stockings, similar to the customization options available for Vidya. But theyâ€™re not the only ones getting new looks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The update added new outfits for Katya, Fenny, and Bubu. Katya was introduced a year ago and is known for her unique appearance and characteristics. Fenny has been in the game since launch and become a fan favorite, and Bubu is a character from last yearâ€™s traditional-themed event.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/katya-1744401375399.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Thereâ€™s also a new hide-and-seek gameplay mode called Letâ€™s Go, Heimdall! for 15 players at a time, where three seekers try to find 12 hiders. On the horizon is the much-anticipated Emotional Purge mode, which adds cover-based shooting gameplay. Itâ€™ll first be available on April 28 and will be further refined in future updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in addition to her new costume, Bubu is also getting a new dorm room at your home base. That also adds new interactable furniture in the form of her Tranquil Desk Set.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/tranquil-desk-set-1744401487995.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Those are the highlights of this update, but thereâ€™s even more thatâ€™s been added. Youâ€™ll just have to play it to see it all. Snowbreak: Containment Zone is available to download for free right now on Steam, iOS, and Android, and itâ€™s cross-platform, so your progress is shared across all platforms.
