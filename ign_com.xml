            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Any game built around gacha mechanics needs to have a certain hook to keep things interesting in the long term, especially if there’s potential to invest your hard-earned dollars into it. For all their systemic sins, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-review"><u>Game of Thrones: Kingsroad</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona5-the-phantom-x-review"><u>Persona 5: The Phantom X</u></a> at least piqued my interest by expanding on already-revered lore, allowing me to intertwine myself in their beloved worlds. The much more enjoyable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zenless-zone-zero-review"><u>Zenless Zone Zero</u></a>, on the other hand, pulled me in with a mix of high-octane combat, endearing character development, and Y2K flair. Arknights: Endfield is the latest competitor in this genre’s fierce attention economy, offering not only an engrossing sci-fi open world to explore, but another mechanically moreish addition: base building and automation. After approximately twenty hours of Endministrating, it’s clear there’s a lot more to uncover here beyond its sticky login loop, but crucially, I’m keen to expand my horizons in search of character motives, upgrades, and ultimately rewarding depth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Arknights: Endfield, you play as the Endministrator (or Endmin for short) who, after a 10-year absence and an unfortunate case of amnesia, returns to the world of the living to reinhabit the planet of Talos-II. Taming the wilds is no small task, though, and on top of trying to remember who you were before your big sleep, you’ll also face off against a range of evil entities, including leather-clad maurauders, shifting zoomorphic creatures, and other mythic, well-dressed baddies. It’s an intriguing premise, unfortunately told through an exposition-heavy opening with awkward stop-and-start pacing. Still, if you brave its dialogue-dense beginning, Arknights: Endfield eventually opens up, delivering visually enticing battles and a captivating atmosphere that help make up for it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Arknights: Endfield Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Your job primarily involves adventuring with your team to the surface of Talos-II to hunt for resources, solve simple environmental platforming puzzles, and eventually clear out whole areas which you can access in the metagame to build and automate machinery. To do this, you’ll use a team of up to four Operators who, under your control, fight and collect items to push the lengthy story ever onwards. Early on, you’ll have a limited pool of story-specific characters to play as, like the masked Endmin, the empathetic mission-oriented Perlica, and the spirited Chen Qianyu, though eventually you’ll be able to use a specially earned gacha currency to pull new characters, too. It’s not the most imaginative gameplay, with many of the puzzles involving finding and pressing a few buttons on a small map to find success, or trawling through the same few groups of bad guys to push through an area. Still, this is all set against a striking cyberpunk backdrop that makes it surprisingly easy to sink hours into. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can imagine, there is an eye-watering array of currencies to consider here — a painful staple of the genre. On top of the usual gacha pulling, which allows you to randomly unlock unique characters and weapons, there’s also a paid Battle Pass that rewards you with resources that can be filtered into systems that help speed up progression, that is, if you can figure them out. It’s hard to say from only the week I’ve spent with it so far whether this feels balanced or not, but I’ve not run into any significant roadblocks that would encourage me to pull out my wallet in the early game – though only time will tell, and based on what I’ve seen so far, I’m not overly confident I won’t eventually find a few.  </p><p>A lot of effort has been put into worldbuilding and character design.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While my humble crew was more than enough for me in the beginning, once I’d earned the currency needed to try out the character lottery firsthand, my feelings began to shift. In my first pull, I drew Estella, an adorable beanie-wearing warrior who compelled me with their nonchalant attitude and stylish techwear garb. Soon after that, I fell in love with Da Pan, a hungry panda whose leather jacket and belt combo gave him the aura of a dad navigating a midlife crisis. I’d like to say I stopped becoming attached to the characters as I kept pulling more. Alas, the range of unique designs, alongside their quippy one-liners, was effective enough to tug on my heartstrings. While I wouldn’t pay for currency with my own money beyond what is provided organically, I was happy to see that, if I did, developer Hypergryph has put a lot of effort into its worldbuilding and character design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It helps that a character’s personality also tends to shape how they move in battle, and throughout my time with Arknights: Endfield, the flashy combat quickly became my favourite aspect. Hits are delivered with vibrant visual payoff, so much so that even my silly mistakes looked like intentional moves. As you explore, you’ll encounter groups of various enemies camped out, like violent blobs of possessed water or sword-wielding bandits, all of which feature level indicators hovering above their heads. Once ready to engage, you run directly at them, weapons brandished, and start swiping away. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead of controlling the Edmin alone, you switch between all the members of your team in battle, applying button-mashing combos that feel engaging in motion. Each character has a dodge, a light attack, and a special attack that string together nicely, delivering well-choreographed combos. Once you knock back an enemy and start to juggle them, you can call in your compatriots to deliver electrifying blows that feel slick – the Endmin’s sword slashes away with golden strikes, while Da Pan delivers belly bounds and butt slams with his towering form. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of combat, the rest of your time is spent investing in the infrastructure of your base. Unlike the complex, automation-based gameplay of beloved factory management simulators <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/factorio-review"><u>Factorio</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/satisfactory-review"><u>Satisfactory</u></a>, Arknights: Endfield’s base building is much more tame, at least early on. And, thanks to lengthy explanations delivered by NPCs, it’s a process that ensures even the most build-averse players can learn how to create a functioning base of operations. </p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sarah's favourite sci-fi jaunts</h3></p><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/sarahathwaites/lists/sarahs-favourite-sci-fi-jaunts" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">First, you’ll plant electric pylons and connect them with relay towers to supply electricity to the area. Though soon enough, you’ll also be able to implement mining as well as machinery that can refine and process raw materials. As someone who hasn’t always enjoyed the intense, efficiency-focused approach of similar automation games, Arknights: Endfield provides a friendly alternative that’s ripe for community collaboration – something I hope develops post-launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s still so much to see before I deliver my final score, like expanding the factories, fully automating my production, and leveling up my team and gear – and that’s before I uncover the truth behind the Endmin’s amnesia. So far, though, I’ve found myself comfortable in its world, and I’m keen to get stuck in and see how far I can push before I hit an inevitably uncomfortable grind.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/arknights-endfield-review]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1411474</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite"><u>Fortnite</u></a> appears to be getting The Office content in Chapter 7 after rumors suggested Epic Games was working on a crossover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of TV and video games were thrown for a loop earlier today when Epic shared a <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/2013733381436236001?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not-so-cryptic tease</a> on social media. It’s the kind of thing that would seem completely nonsensical to the uninitiated, but those who are even peripherally aware of the NBC comedy will recognize “Build. Beets. Battle Royale.” as a reference to one of the most memorable quotes from The Office.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Build. Beets. Battle Royale. <a href="https://t.co/erCDcS0ZSS" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/erCDcS0ZSS</a></p>— Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/2013733381436236001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 20, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">A meeting between Fortnite and The Office, though never considered to be impossible, is unexpected, but some recent rumors had players believing confirmation was only a matter of time. Popular Fortnite content creator Shiina said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzUlbmE9wFE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>they heard The Office could soon show up</u></a> just last week. At the time, they suggested a rumor about “<a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/2011479573670596794?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a nostalgic duo from a live-action TV series</u></a>” was tied to the show but neglected to share more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which members of the Dunder Mifflin crew could be recreated in Epic’s battle royale mega-hit remains a mystery, but references to names like Michael Scott, Dwight Schrute, Jim Halpert, and Pam Beesly seem the most likely. It’s also unclear when exactly we’ll learn more about the potential Fortnite crossover, but some fans are already taking the tease as an opportunity to share their excitement.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/4bPhs7pSXy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/4bPhs7pSXy</a></p>— Jorge_Most (@Jorge_Most) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jorge_Most/status/2013733775599940005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 20, 2026</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/b8LFozezOn" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/b8LFozezOn</a></p>— FNAssist (@FN_Assist) <a href="https://twitter.com/FN_Assist/status/2013734371316879743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 20, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Shiina, meanwhile, has already posted an update since the Fortnite The Office tease reared its head. Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvGl6kixgSE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new video</a> comes with the suggestion that the classic workplace comedy is coming soon, with content for Regular Show and Ed, Edd n Eddy also in the works at Epic. Players may want to take all of today’s information with a grain of salt, but with Fortnite’s track record for wild crossovers in mind, it wouldn’t be much of a surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-zero-hour-live-event-draws-105-million-players-as-godzilla-king-kong-iron-man-and-kpop-demon-hunters-unite-for-avengers-endgame-style-finale"><u>launched into Chapter 7</u></a> in November with an Avenger-style team-up event.

            <guid>1411381</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Anime is awesome. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">Board games</a> are also awesome. Put the two together, and you get tabletop fun that not only shows off some of the hottest anime series out there, but can also capture the wild nature of the animated media and their associated tropes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are plenty of games that have animed-themed versions like Naruto Monopoly or Dragonball Z Yahtzee, this list instead focuses on games that use the IPs they feature as a theme rather than simply being an anime reskin, and games that do a great job in replicating the look, feel, or tropes of this beloved art form. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just as a side note before we get into the list itself, this will only feature board games and won’t go into the plethora of solid anime TCGs that exist, like Digimon and One Piece, or TTRPGs either. Those are out there, and I recommend seeking those out, too, if that is more your style.</p><p id="react-the-arts-of-war"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Re;ACT - The Arts of War">Re;ACT - The Arts of War</h2></p><div id="234233"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234233" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Re;ACT - The Arts of War</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast-paced matches with hot-looking anime characters, each with dynamic and unique mechanics? Sign me up! Re;Act from Brother Ming Games puts players in the roles of artists who've been granted powers based on their respective art forms and are pitted against one another in a 1v1 showdown. Described as “Yugioh meets chess” by the creator Ming Yang Lu, where the importance of positioning from chess crosses over with the interrupts and actions of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yu-gi-oh-tcg">Yugioh</a>, where you will declare your intentions by playing a card before allowing the opponent to play a reaction, acting akin to a trap card. From super-powered  Calligraphers to Dancers, Animators, and Painters, Re;Act: The Arts of War is shonen anime in a box and a blast to play.</p></div><p id="millennium-blades"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Millennium Blades">Millennium Blades</h2></p><div id="234398"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234398" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Millennium Blades</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Crack packs, build decks, and outfit yourself with the coolest deckbox out there in Millennium Blades – a board game about competing in a card game. Players are pro TCG players who are all vying to win the most points by doing well in the game’s three tournaments. Outside of the actual tournaments, which see you playing cards to score points, there are real-time trading and buying phases where you will trade cards with other players or the store, and buy packs of cards using Monopoly-esque money. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like the real world, the meta of the game will change as the game progresses and force you to adjust your approach and swap out cards. There are so many clever nods and homages to other games and anime that give Millennium Blades a wonderful identity, but don’t let its silliness fool you – it's a tense and highly strategic game with plenty of content, so you'll never play the same game twice. </p></div><p id="power-rangers-heroes-of-the-grid"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Power Rangers: Heroes of the Grid">Power Rangers: Heroes of the Grid</h2></p><div id="234399"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234399" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Power Rangers: Heroes of the Grid</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This may be splitting hairs a bit since TECHNICALLY,  Power Rangers, aka Super Sentai, isn’t anime, but their motif and idea can be found in plenty of anime, and Super Sentai and its sibling Kamen Rider are just as much a part of Japan's entertainment history as anime, and so Power Rangers: Heroes of the Grid is on this list. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Heroes of the Grid is a cooperative boss battler in which the Ranger players attempt to take out the chosen monster of the week and big bad like Rita Repulsa before their forces overwhelm Angel Grove. Each Ranger has a unique deck and the respective zords they play with to get the job done, and with the plethora of expansions this game has, you can use your favorite ranger teams and villains. Heroes of the Grid is a great <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">co-op board game</a> with teamwork and strategy being front and center. It's sure to delight Power Ranger fans.</p></div><p id="guilty-gear-strive-the-board-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Guilty Gear -Strive- The Board Game">Guilty Gear -Strive- The Board Game</h2></p><div id="234400"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234400" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Guilty Gear -Strive- The Board Game</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most stylish anime fighting games of the modern video game generation is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/guilty-gear">Guilty Gear series</a> by Arc System Works. The same anime flair carries over into the board game adaptation, Guilty Gear Strive: The Board Game, which was released last year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This 1v1 dueling game features 20 characters from Strive, each with their own decks to play that highlight the styles and moves from the video game counterpart. It uses the Exceed card game system, so positioning of your character is crucial in Strive with attacks requiring different spacing to pull off and rewards keeping the momentum and pressure on. Set-up is fast and matches are over quickly, making this a great <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">quick board game</a> to act as a filler between bigger ones or playing a bunch of rounds. Like we said in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/guilty-gear-strive-the-board-game-review"><u>review</u></a>, this game captures not only the look of the source material but also what we love about fighting games.

In Bento Panic, players take on the role of their favorite Straw Hat and celebrate a recent victory in the best way they know how – with a feast! Sitting in a circle, using their hands, all at once, players show a different gesture to declare their action from their turn, either pulling food tokens from the blind bag, stealing food from a neighbor, blocking a steal, or eating food. Points are scored by eating sets of food tokens, with the game only ending when Luffy wakes from his food coma a third time. Luffy’s Bento Panic makes a great <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults">party board game</a>, since everyone takes their turn at once. And like we mentioned in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-piece-luffys-bento-panic-board-game-review"><u>review</u></a>, even folks who aren’t necessarily fans of One Piece will have a good time with this one.</p></div><p id="aegis-combining-robots-second-ignit"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="AEGIS Combining Robots: Second Ignit">AEGIS Combining Robots: Second Ignition</h2></p><div id="234402"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234402" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>AEGIS Combining Robots: Second Ignition</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For nearly as long as anime has existed, super robots and combining robots have been a part of it. AEGIS Combining Robots: Second Ignition lets players assemble teams, led by powerful Commanders with special abilities, of mecha from five different classes – Assault, Evasive, Guard, Intel and Support – and duke it out to try and be the team that comes out on top. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the mechs are strong by themselves, things really heat up when they start combining, turning the game from a strategic tactics game into something reminiscent of the fights out of GunBuster or GaoGaiGear. Manage your energy and pick the right time to combine your bots and grasp victory. For folks who prefer a more cooperative approach, additional modes are included, letting you and a friend take on buffed boss bots that will put your teamwork to the test. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With 100+ mecha, each with its own skill loadout and standee, AEGIS gives you plenty of options for how to make your team, and Second Ignition is compatible with the first game, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOj1N7?object_uuid=233a3f1d-a0c4-4fc0-be24-ccfe59a63870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AEGIS: Combining Robot Strategy Game</a>, which just saw a reprint, giving you even more options.

Space Serenade is a semi-cooperative <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deck builder</a> that's reminiscent of games like Star Realms, where you play cards for their resources and effects to buy new ones to add to your deck or to try and capture your targets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of the four playable characters from the show – Spike, Ed, Faye, and Jet – comes with a set of cards special to them in addition to the generic ones that compose your starting hand. From there, it's a race to collect bounties and earn victory points to prove that you are the best bounty hunter in the galaxy. This game features plastic miniatures of your characters and cards depicting scenes from the anime, creating an authentic and fun deck builder for fans of the genre and source material.</p></div><p id="bullet-star-board-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Bullet Star Board Game">Bullet Star Board Game</h2></p><div id="234404"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234404" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bullet Star Board Game</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Adopting the shoot-’em-up genre of video games for the tabletop, the Bullet series puts you in the role of different anime-like heroes as you avoid quickly approaching bullets and survive long enough to be the last one standing. The Bullet series is a real-time, pattern-matching puzzle game, and instead of shooting at the other players, you frantically attempt to remove the incoming bullets from reaching their own life points. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the course of three-minute rounds, players blindly pull bullet tokens from their bags and spend action points to help rearrange the tokens on their boards into patterns that allow bullets to be destroyed. At the end off each round, the destroyed bullets are moved to the player on their left to be added to the mix, similar to dropping Tetris blocks on your opponent. Bullet is a fast-paced game whose real-time countdown component and puzzle-based gameplay make it a refreshing anime addition to your board game shelf. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

Exploits are in the line of fire this time, with the update said to fix glitches related to item and ammo duplication, the ability to damage other players from behind certain geometry, and a bug that let players reach out-of-bounds locations – specifically on Stella Montis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cold, labyrinthian halls of Stella Montis have already garnered a reputation for being perhaps the most cutthroat topside area Arc Raiders has to offer, and its abundance of cheaters isn’t helping. Streamers and everyday Raiders alike have reported dying to cheaters on the high-difficulty map for some time, with the out-of-bounds exploit proving to be especially problematic for months. The clip (above) showcases how the glitch has been used to steal some of the best Arc Raiders loot from players who are looking to extract back to Speranza or even just play some music.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, update 1.12.0 is here to take care of what is maybe Embark’s most infamous exploit, but it sounds like it’s more of a speed bump than a stop sign. Just as the patch made its way to players across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S, Discord users began to report they were still losing runs to Raiders behind walls in Stella Montis. The developer’s patch notes do say that “various” – and not necessarily all – out-of-bounds map locations had been addressed, but that isn’t stopping fans from expressing their disappointment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There is still a wall glitch in Stella (somewhere in the lobby area),” one Discord user said. “Embark is incapable of fixing their game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, I guess they didn’t fix wall glitches because I just got killed by 3 people inside the seed vault extract in Stella Montis,” another added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This patch notes seems like it only attracted rats into walls on Stella,” another player said.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Disattisfaction with the update seems to stem from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1808500/view/527614009105449109?l=english" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a December 11 patch</u></a>, which was said to have tackled an out-of-bounds glitch related to zipline use on Stella Montis, only for players to find themselves still dealing with cheaters weeks later. Players have also shared reports of wall exploits at Dam Battlegrounds and Spaceport, with an ongoing issue related to an unopenable door in Stella Montis adding to the pile of glitches riling up the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark shared earlier this month that out-of-bounds glitches had been added to a list of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters"><u>anti-cheat fixes it hoped to implement</u></a> “over the next few weeks,” suggesting update 1.12.0 may be just one step in a larger plan. While players have waited weeks for exploit fixes, and Stella Montis may have a few holes to fill yet, some say they’re willing to give the studio more time to get Arc Raiders into shape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t know much about game design, but I’m sure it takes a while to find and fix problems within coding,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qhx5zw/comment/o0n5ocv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user argues</u></a>. “So I think people should be happy that they’ve fixed the exploits that have been such a source of complaints for so long.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders launched October 30, 2025, for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X | S.
