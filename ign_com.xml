            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With a week to go until the official launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, fans have issued a warning over online spoilers, as datamined details from the game have begun to leak online — including word of even more new Mega Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends Z-A is due to launch on October 16 for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, but already there's evidence of early copies filtering out into the wild. And now, as of this morning, IGN has seen evidence that the game is actively being datamined to extract its secrets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To date, The Pokémon Company has revealed just a handful of the new Mega Pokémon expected to make up the game's final roster of fresh Mega species. And while an older leak had listed out many of the still-to-be-confirmed Mega Evolutions, there's evidence today that even more creatures may be included than first expected.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In response to all this, Pokémon fans have now begun signalling that anyone hoping to go into Pokémon Legends: Z-A without seeing spoilers should be mindful of where they click online over the next few days — or log off social media completely. (IGN will not be spoiling any of the new species here.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in Kalos, home of the Mega Pokémon mechanic, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-new-mega-pokmon-announced-for-pokmon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A adds the first new batch of superpowered creatures to the franchise's Mega Pokédex in over a decade</a>, although no all-new Pokémon species are expected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New Mega Evolutions include the majestic-looking Mega Dragonite — which has also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-mega-pokmon-gets-surprise-anime-appearance-months-before-debut-in-pokmon-legends-z-a">now made its Pokémon anime debut</a> — plus Mega Victreebell, Mega Hawlucha and Mega Malamar. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">New Mega Pokemon in Legends: Z-A</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Post-launch, Pokémon Legends: Z-A will unlock Mega Evolutions for each of the three fully-evolved Starter Pokémon, available via online play: Delphox, Greninja and Chesnaught. And beyond that, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-a-getting-dlc-starring-mega-raichu">you can already buy Pokémon Legends: Z-A: Mega Dimension</a>, a paid DLC which will add two new Mega Evolutions for Raichu. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-as-30-mega-dimension-dlc-pushes-price-of-owning-every-new-mega-evolution-to-100-on-nintendo-switch-2">fans have complained about the costs of obtaining every Mega Pokémon announced so far</a>, something which requires more than $100 to obtain the base game, DLC and a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How many other new Mega Evolutions will Pokémon Legends: Z-A include? We're about to find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Then boy, is today your lucky day — Night City now boasts its own take on the Wordle phenomenon, thanks to one clever modder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-can-now-serve-daily-word-puzzles-thanks-to-a-mod-called-gonkle-and-the-answers-probably-choom" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>RPS</u></a>, Gonkle delivers a daily word puzzle to your in-game device once a day. And just like the game that inspired it, you get six guesses to solve the five-letter word. As the mod description confirms, it's the same word for everyone, so "don't be a gonk, keep your streak alive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best bit, however, is not that you get two chances to play a Wordle-type game per day, but that the word list is manually curated and pulls from Cyberpunk sourcebooks, "so you'll frequently get the CHOOM etc." So if you've been looking for a way to boost your Cyberpunk lore knowledge or get better acquainted with the in-game lingo, now's your chance.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/screenshot-2025-10-10-at-10-31-29-1760088701787.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Gonkle is a Cyberpunk 2077 take on Wordle.
