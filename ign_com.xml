Today, <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2025/0130.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo announced</a> it will no longer accept “credit cards issued overseas” and “PayPal accounts opened overseas” from January 25, 2025. Nintendo said it took the decision to curb “fraudulent use."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Western Nintendo Switch owners have for years now created regional Nintendo accounts to capitalize on cheaper prices or wider availability of titles that are not in their home region. This change creates a larger barrier for anyone residing outside of Japan to buy games at the store. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are several Japan-only Switch titles that players abroad will no longer be able to access, including Tactics title Nobunaga’s Ambition: Sphere of Influence, Mecha mashup titles Super Robot Wars T and V, a Yo-Kai Watch remake, and most notably Mother 3, which remains a Japan exclusive for Nintendo Switch Online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What is curious is that this change only affects the Japanese eShop, so users of the American and European eShop will still be able to make purchases across those respective regions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll still be able to use physical Nintendo Switch cartridges from Japan as the system is not region-locked. So, unless you are looking to buy an eShop title that is download-only, you can still play Japanese games on your Nintendo Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is of course about to focus on the upcoming Switch 2, which will be detailed in an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-announced-for-april">April Direct</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Sayem is a freelancer based in the UK, covering tech &amp; hardware.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-swings-onto-steam-with-forgiving-pc-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s Marvel Spider-Man 2 swings onto PC today, January 30, and while the intrepid webslinger’s port plans have been in the works for a while, we didn’t know exactly how well it might run on PCs until now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-features-and-ray-tracing-options-detailed-out-tomorrow/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation Blog</u></a>, developer Nixxes Software shared all the fancy PC features available in the port, which has been developed to “finetune performance and fidelity across a broad range of hardware configurations."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Accompanying a new trailer, below, Spider-Man 2 on PC <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-you-wont-have-to-link-a-psn-account-to-play-some-of-its-pc-games-anymore"><u>drops the hard PSN requirement</u></a> for PC players and adds advanced raytracing features such as DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“In Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 on PC with ray reconstruction enabled, we see more detailed ray-traced reflections and better-defined ray-traced shadows, especially when viewing raytracing effects at steep angles," said Nixxes graphics programmer Menno Bil. "We also see improvements in the ray-traced interiors and less ghosting and noise in the ray-traced ambient occlusion.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also available are DLSS 3 and FSR 3.1 Upscaling and Frame generation technologies, with Intel’s XeSS upscaler also available. DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation is not supported out of the box, but using the Nvidia app you may be able to swap out to the newer transformer model to enhance DLSS 3’s Frame Generation image quality. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those looking to play using wider monitors, ultrawide support is available up to a staggering 48:9 aspect ratio, with all cinematics viewable up to 32:9. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/30/spider-man-specs-1738238762975.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Spider-Man 2 PC specs. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The requirements themselves are split between ray-traced and non-ray-traced configurations, which reveals that if you aren’t bothered about fancy reflections you can run the title at 720p and 30 FPS using a very modest older system with low-end parts like an Nvidia GTX 1650 alongside an Intel Core i3 8100 and 16 GB of RAM.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For gamers running higher-end rigs, you’ll also be able to make full use of your hardware, with the 4K 60 FPS configuration at “Ray Tracing Ultimate” requiring an RTX 4090, AMD Ryzen 7800X3D, and 32 GB of RAM.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But can Spider-Man 2 run on Steam Deck? Given the high RAM requirements and need for a relatively modern graphics card, it might be possible, but don’t hold your breath for Steam Deck verification. Spider-Man and Spider-Man: Miles Morales both had PS4 ports, which meant that the titles were a touch more scalable, whereas the previously PS5-exclusive Spider-Man 2 may demand more out of the hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, the wide number of configurations on the requirements have been praised online. One user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1id7g4t/comment/m9wy1fz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented</u></a> on Reddit: “This must be the best hardware requirements sheet I’ve seen so far." "Honestly, great job," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1id7g4t/comment/m9xjlc8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ItsMeIcebear4 added</a>. "If performance lives up to this, it'll be very well received."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sayem is a freelancer based in the UK, covering tech &amp; hardware.
