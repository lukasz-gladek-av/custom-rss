It’s a freebie that grants access to the 2012 title at no extra cost, but as many share their excitement online, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/49520/Borderlands_2/#app_reviews_hash" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Borderlands 2 Steam reviews</u></a> are telling a different story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the All Reviews section boasts a “Very Positive” rating on Steam with more than 287,000 user reviews, the more than 3,300 Recent Reviews have the second Borderlands game’s reactions labeled “Mostly Negative.” The downward trend began around May 20, 2025, with a particularly large movement of negative responses filling its reviews section today.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/05/screenshot-2025-06-05-161818-1749167697352.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Borderlands 2 Steam User Reviews. Screenshot captured by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This spike in negative Borderlands 2 reviews comes not from a gameplay update or troubled servers but instead key changes Gearbox parent company Take-Two Interactive made to <a href="https://www.take2games.com/legal/en-US/#11-responsibility" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>its Terms of Service</u></a> in February of this year. Players are using their reviews to point to a few topics, including concerns the end-user license agreement (EULA) condemns the use of mods, cheats, and VPNs. However, the primary concern being echoed across social media channels relates to fears Take-Two, 2K Games, and Gearbox are harvesting data and private information.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the best games ever made. I cannot recommend it to anyone right now due to the publisher adding spyware into an updated EULA that you have to accept to launch it,” one <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198083384906/recommended/49520/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>popular review from Steam user RyeTheTactician</u></a> says. “It's called forced arbitration and it's one of the scummiest things shady people want to normalize. I will not change it to a positive review until this is fixed, too bad, I had fun will all the Borderlands games in multiple devices, but will probably not play this or [Borderlands 4] for a long time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198142247081/recommended/49520/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Another complaint</u></a> working its way to the top of the conversation involves the wider idea of a publisher altering the terms of service for a game that launched nearly 13 years ago. Some have gone as far as to ask for refund options if they wish to decline the updated document's conditions. Others are also highlighting Borderlands 2’s status as a relatively casual video game with a focus on single-player and co-op experience. The idea is that, without a substantial, competitive multiplayer component, there should be no reason for Take-Two to fear how cheaters may impact the experience of the average Borderlands player.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>People are review-bombing the Borderlands games because Gearbox/2K made EULA changes</p><p>Looks like people are review bombing the entire **Borderlands** series because Gearbox/2K made EULA changes that can apparently gain root-level access to your machine under the guise of… <a href="https://t.co/fZwAoSr9wo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/fZwAoSr9wo</a></p></div>— Pirat_Nation 🔴 (@Pirat_Nation) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pirat_Nation/status/1924670214987206782?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two’s terms of service update can be found when booting up other 2K titles, including the original <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/729040/Borderlands_Game_of_the_Year_Enhanced/#app_reviews_hash" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Borderlands</u></a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/397540/Borderlands_3/#app_reviews_hash" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Borderlands 3</u></a>, which are currently on sale for $9.89 and $3.99, respectively, on Steam. Each title has received a different level of review bombing, with nearly all users pointing to the EULA as the cause behind their freshly added thumbs-down rating. There’s even <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/vcxzvxzcvxczadsadsqw/recommended/49520/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a specific list of grievances being copy-pasted</u></a> across the Steam reviews section for each game, which includes concerns that Take-Two is taking advantage of sensitive information such as names, email addresses, IP addresses, billing details, phone numbers, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Changing the ToS and turning games into spyware and then offering the game for free in order to then steal data from unknowing people is pretty bold,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Critikal14/recommended/49520/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam user =SilvioHammer=</u></a> alleges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many have used their reviews to specifically call out Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford, who attempted to address privacy fears with a post on X/Twitter last week. When <a href="https://x.com/Gods_Full_Armor/status/1928344562403074220" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one fan said</u></a> the EULA update had “essentially turned every Borderlands game into spyware with access to all of our information,” Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1928521510618042521" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>assured</u></a> PC fans that there are no software-level changes to the Borderlands games that should have players worried about spyware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nothing has or will change about the software,” Pitchford said at the time. “I think the publisher legal team is covering their bases, but that has nothing to do with what we’re doing. I cannot change the EULA - that’s decided at the publisher level. But I can assure that there is no spyware in the software.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah - humans are involved. It sucks to get brigaded when we’re over here making good games. Everyone should make their own decisions, though, so if running a protest because of fear over some lawyers covering their butts, I guess that’s the world we have to live in.</p>— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1928608796206653672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 31, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford's comments have been backed by other players who feel the reaction to the Take-Two's changes is a bit overblown. This includes clarification from some who say the EULA has gone largely unchanged for years, going as far as to say previous versions of the document already included several of the conditions players are voicing concern about now. It's unclear how the significant the February changes to the terms of service were, but overreaction or not, it's clear a vocal portion of the Borderlands community is no longer happy with what the agreement entails.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"People are overreacting for sure," one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/1kpj0oj/comment/msy261f/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit comment says</a>. "The EULA is hardly any different than the one before it all the way back in 2018. People are just freaking out now because some clickbaiting content creator told them to."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s currently unclear if Take-Two will update its terms of service in any way that could alleviate privacy concerns or the criticism related to mod support. For those who pick up Borderlands 2, which is available to own for free until June 8 at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET, the terms of service agreement in question pops up when you boot up the game for the first time. Those who decline it can continue to enjoy the experience but only while playing offline.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The updated terms of service will likely need to be accepted in order to play Gearbox’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4"><u>Borderlands 4</u></a> online as well. It’s set to launch September 12, 2025, for PC via the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S. A Nintendo Switch 2 version will launch at a later date.

Whether you’re looking for the extra protection a case can bring, the better ergonomics of a great controller, or a backup battery to ensure you’re never without juice, we’ve got you covered with great gear for your Switch Lite. Check out a <a href="#switch" data-cy="styled-link">detailed look at the best Nintendo Switch Lite accessories</a>, or check the shopping list below: </p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR – These are the best Nintendo Switch Lite Accessories:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch Lite is more compact with a smaller screen compared to the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-switch"><u>Switch</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-oled-review"><u>OLED model</u></a>, which means some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-accessories"><u>best Nintendo Switch accessories</u></a> aren’t compatible with this ultra-portable model. That’s why we’ve created a guide just for the Lite, so you can kit it out to be a real road warrior, and you might be able to score some awesome <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals"><u>Nintendo Switch deals</u></a> in the process.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="switch"><u><strong></strong></u></h2><p id="best-case"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best case">1. Nintendo Switch Lite Carry Case + Screen Protector</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Nintendo Switch Lite Case</h3><div catalogid="6f946ddf-b268-49ce-b3a5-c703b748fece" id="211062"><div id="211062" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch Lite Carry Case + Screen Protector</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Providing 360-degree protection with minimal bulk, this case securely zips, has space for game cartridges, and even comes with a screen protector.</p></div></div><div><div><p>360-degree protection with minimal bulk</p></div><div><p>Includes a screen protector</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Your Nintendo Switch Lite's portability is one of its chief assets, and you shouldn't have to sacrifice that to protect it when you're on the go. The Nintendo Switch Lite Carry Case + Screen protector should have you covered. It adds minimal bulk by sticking close to the dimensions of the Switch Lite itself while providing 360-degree protection. There are also some fun designs to match different Switch games, like the Animal Crossing design we’ve linked, but unfortunately, Bells aren’t an accepted currency. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-case">best Nintendo Switch cases</a> you can buy, adding simple convenience and peace of mind. It zips and unzips easily to slide your Switch Lite in nice and snug or out when you’re ready to get your game on. Though compact, the case still offers additional storage for you to carry a collection of game cartridges. Finally, with this combo, you get a screen protector, so even when you throw it in your backpack without the case, you don’t need to worry about scratching the screen. Coming in around $25, this is an excellent investment in protection. </p></div><p id="best-rugged-case"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best rugged case">2. ButterFox Switch Lite Carrying Case</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Nintendo Switch Lite Rugged Case</h3><div catalogid="6f946ddf-b268-49ce-b3a5-c703b748fece" id="211063"><div id="211063" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>ButterFox Switch Lite Carrying Case</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Bulky case offering a sturdy shell and plenty of storage space, including a mesh pocket and two storage layers for 19 game cartridges and two microSD cards.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't mind a little extra bulk while toting your Nintendo Switch Lite around, the ButterFox Switch Lite Carrying Case is an excellent option. It offers a sturdy shell with a nifty handle to protect your Switch Lite from drops and scratches and room to house all your favorite accessories. You even get a bunch of different color options to choose from. And best of all, this case is incredibly affordable, so you can snag it for under $20 and have money left over to score some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-game-deals">great game deals</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the Nintendo Switch Lite Carry Case, ButterFox provides plenty of space for storage and uses it cleverly. Two organizer layers offer slots for 19 game cartridges and two microSD cards, so you should rarely be without your favorite games. These layers double as a protective microfiber lining over the screen and a buffer to keep other accessories from pressing the Switch Lite's controls. A mesh pocket provides room to hold charging cables, earbuds, and even a modest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-portable-power-banks"><u>portable charger</u></a>, while quality zippers ensure everything remains safely tucked away in the case.  </p></div><p id="best-cover"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best cover">3. Hori DuraFlexi Protector</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Nintendo Switch Lite Cover</h3><div catalogid="6f946ddf-b268-49ce-b3a5-c703b748fece" id="211064"><div id="211064" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hori DuraFlexi Protector</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Wrapping the Switch Lite in flexible TPU that absorbs shock, the Hori DuraFlexi Protector keeps your device safe while giving you access to essential controls and ports.</p></div></div><div><p>Flexible TPU absorbs shock and protects</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Nintendo Switch is designed to be used with your TV and sometimes on the go, the Switch Lite is a true traveler. That makes it much more susceptible to damage out in the wild. The power of just a bit of plastic wrapped around the device could be the difference between making it or breaking it, literally. The Hori DuraFlexi Protector should hopefully prevent the latter from happening. It covers the Switch Lite around the sides and back in a flexible TPU that can absorb shock and protect the portable console, similar to a phone case. So, if you have butter fingers or just want to slide your Switch into a bag without hassling with a carrying case, this cover is for you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Hori DuraFlexi Protector is classy, simple with Pokemon and Animal Crossing designs available. The cover also features perfectly placed cutouts to ensure you can easily access all of the Switch Lite's ports while the sleeve is on, so when you’re juicing up, you won’t have to remove the cover. The material used even gives you a bit of extra grip. And while the impressively low price tag may raise some red flags, it's worth noting that the DuraFlexi protector is officially licensed by Nintendo.</p></div><p id="best-rugged-cover"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best rugged cover">4. Orzly Grip Case</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Nintendo Switch Lite Rugged Cover</h3><div catalogid="6f946ddf-b268-49ce-b3a5-c703b748fece" id="211065"><div id="211065" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Orzly Grip Case</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>A rugged case delivering protection from drops, extra grip for the body and thumbsticks, and a kickstand.</p></div></div><div><p>Handles improve Switch Lite’s ergonomics</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Are you one of those people prone to dropping all of your electronics? You’ll be covered, literally, with the Orzly Grip Case. This cover is rubberized and ready to put your Nintendo Switch Lite in a protective embrace, covering all around to shield it from your flimsy grip. It’ll prevent bumps and scrapes while also giving your hands more grip. And though this is an excellent rugged case, it adds just 25 grams of weight to your Switch Lite, so you won't have to stop calling it Lite just because you've tucked it into this case. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What you get from the Orzly Grip Case is far more than just protection for the console. Orzly added thicker handles to the sides, making up for the lack of ergonomics around the Switch Lite's controls. This kit also provides covers for the thumbsticks for more tactile control and less wear. There’s even some storage, so you won’t have to leave your favorite games behind, while a kickstand on the case allows you to enjoy content hands-free. Orzly makes this case in a variety of colors, and it’s super affordable, making it easy to keep your device safe and your vibe intact. </p></div><p id="best-screen-protector"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best screen protector">5. amFilm Tempered Glass Screen Protector</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Nintendo Switch Lite Screen Protector</h3><div catalogid="6f946ddf-b268-49ce-b3a5-c703b748fece" id="211066"><div id="211066" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>amFilm Tempered Glass Screen Protector</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Keep the Switch Lite’s plastic screen free from scratches and damage with this glossy, premium glass screen protector kit.</p></div></div><div><p>Installation kit included</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch Lite features a plastic screen just like its console brethren, which means it'll be very prone to scratching. You're going to want a screen protector to prevent any damage. There are a ton of Switch Lite screen protectors popping up on the market, but amFilm's Tempered Glass Screen Protector is the tried and true most trusted. It’s also a super affordable way to keep your Switch safe, costing just under $10. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This particular Switch Lite screen protector is made of tempered glass, which won't scratch nearly as easily as the plastic screen, giving your handheld the glossy, premium glass screen it should have had from the get-go. You get more than just the screen protector, as the kit offers wet wipes, a microfiber cleaning cloth, and a squeeze card to ensure the smoothest installation possible without any dust bubbles or smudges. amFilm’s Tempered Glass Screen Protector also happens to be a three-pack, so you'll have enough screen protectors to use as replacements for years to come—or if you screw up installation on the first attempt. </p></div><p id="best-grip"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best grip">6.

You can upgrade your hold with the grip from Satisfye. This attachment slides right onto your Switch Lite, adding two palm fins to give your hands something to really grab onto, while the included thumb pads add extra protection and a tactile feel. The grip also helps give your thumbs a bit more room to move, especially when reaching for the D-Pad or right thumbstick, making your entire gaming experience much more enjoyable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We loved the version of the grip from Satisfye for the full-size <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/13/satisfye-gaming-grip-for-nintendo-switch-review"><u>Nintendo Switch</u></a>, so it's nice to see a model for the smaller Switch Lite.

And sometimes, a finger isn’t always the ideal tool for the job, as they can leave oils and grease on the screen, making it harder to see over time and requiring more cleaning. Plus, your hands can get in the way of what you’re playing, especially where precision is concerned. So, if you plan to play games centered around the touch input on the Nintendo Switch Lite, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/scribblenauts-showdown"><u>Scribblenauts Showdown</u></a>, a stylus comes in handy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Adonit Mark is an affordable stylus, coming in under $10, that will register just like a finger on a touchscreen but won’t leave the same residue. This stylus features a mesh tip to hold up better over time than some of the soft, silicone-tipped styluses you might find. Its triangular shape ensures the stylus doesn’t roll away from you, while the durable aluminum body means you’ll be good to toss it in your bag or wherever. Since the Nintendo Switch Lite’s display is in charge of registering the touches, the Adonit Mark also doesn’t require any power, making it a portable partner for your Switch Lite.</p></div><p id="what-to-look-for"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What to look for">What to look for in a Nintendo Switch Lite Accessory</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most important thing you should keep in mind while shopping for Switch Lite accessories is that all accessories designed for the original Switch won’t necessarily work with Nintendo’s smaller handheld system. The Switch Lite is simply a different system that has smaller dimensions, integrated controllers, a lack of motion, and IR sensors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some cases and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-battery-cases-for-the-nintendo-switch">battery cases</a> for instance are just going to be too large. While the Switch Lite will fit, it’ll probably jumble around with all the extra space inside. The same thing goes for screen protectors unless you’re ready to cut them down with a box cutter or some kind of knife, they’re going to be too big for the Switch Lite’s smaller display.</p><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/07/nintendo-switch-lite-preorder-720x405.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, most if not all of the Labo Nintendo has released isn’t going to work with the Nintendo Switch Lite.

While you may be able to use other Labo kits like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-labo-vehicle-kit">Vehicle Kit</a>, it wouldn’t quite be the same because you can’t connect the Switch Lite to a TV.</p><p id="faq"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="FAQ">Nintendo Switch Lite Accessories FAQ</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Does the Switch support Bluetooth? </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch consoles have always supported Bluetooth pairing with controllers, but until recently, there was no support for Bluetooth audio. Luckily, if your Switch’s system version is updated to 13.0.0 or higher, Bluetooth audio should work without the need for an adapter. That means you can use the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-wireless-earbuds"><u>best wireless earbuds</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-wireless-bluetooth-headphones"><u>headphones</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-bluetooth-speakers"><u>speakers</u></a> with your Switch.

This Switch model doesn't connect to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-for-gaming"><u>gaming TVs</u></a>, so a dock and HDMI cord aren’t in the box. The Joy-Cons don’t detach either, meaning you won't find straps or a grip for them. Instead, you’ll only find a USB-C charger.
