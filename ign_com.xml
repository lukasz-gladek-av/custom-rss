And alongside arriving in the Switch 2 launch window, Agent 47 will also be donning some new, appropriately Nintendo-themed duds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On <a href="https://ioi.dk/?panel=hitman%2Fnews%2F2025%2Fsignature-edition-launching-on-nintendo-switch-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IO Interactive's site</a>, the developer confirmed Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition will go up for pre-order soon, for both digital and physical editions. A pre-order of the digital edition will get you the Signature Pack, which includes two red-and-white outfits for Agent 47, a golden wrench, and a mushroom. Mushroom effects unknown at this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Physical pre-orders, meanwhile, offer both the Signature Pack and the Quack Pack, which offers a Luigi-themed green-and-grey suit and a green rubber duck. Much like a bald guy in a red tie and suit at a Paris fashion show, nothing unusual to see here.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/02/unnamed-1-1743612341462.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/02/unnamed-1743612341462.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Less-than-subtle references aside, it's fun to see Agent 47 get some Nintendo attire. Other games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/31/heres-how-the-bayonettanintendo-costumes-were-designed">Bayonetta</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/12/e3-2017-skyrim-for-switch-includes-zelda-items-amiibo-compatibility">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a> got their own Nintendo crossover cosmetics, and Agent 47 certainly has earned a bit of Nintendo theming of his own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The World of Assassination spans a trilogy of games, as Agent 47 undertakes a number of missions to assassinate targets and complete contracts for his clientele. Starting with 2016's Hitman, the WoA trilogy runs up through Hitman III, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-3-review">IGN gave a 9</a>, saying: "Rich, rewarding, and highly replayable, Hitman 3 is one of the barcoded butcher's best appearances."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition combines all of it together into one package. This includes the main campaign, contracts mode, escalations, Elusive Target arcades, and featured live content for Hitman, Hitman 2, and Hitman 3. Also included is the Freelancer game mode, a roguelike option for those who want even more variety and options in their Hitman experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition is due to arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in June 2025. Its also available now on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, the original Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation PS VR2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's called Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD, and it's coming to the console at launch on June 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Bravely series of RPGs was begun as a spin-off of sorts of Final Fantasy back in the 3DS era, with Bravely Default: Flying Fairy being the first in the series. The games feature a unique battle mechanic where players can either opt to "Default" or defend, and store energy to then "Brave" and make multiple moves in a single turn.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bravely Default making a return is a big deal, as both Bravely Default and Bravely Second, its direct sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bravely-default-3ds-games-shutting-down-online-features-soon">had their online city-building features shut down</a> in 2023. This version appears to bring back the online features in some fashion, alongside "upgraded features and enhancements" and a number of new minigames. The exact nature of these upgrades is still up in the air, so we'll have to wait to find out exactly how much is different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch already has one Bravely game, Bravely Default 2 (not to be confused with the aforementioned Bravely Second), which came out in 2022 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bravely-default-2-review">which we gave an 8/10</a>, calling it "a long, familiar JRPG journey with excellent customizable combat and beautiful backdrops that pass the time as you work through its extended stretches of grinding."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at the Nintendo Direct today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It‚Äôs far from a release date and could absolutely be pushed, but for now, it‚Äôs the most promising update for Hollow Knight: Silksong we‚Äôve gotten in years.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally confirmed for just Nintendo Switch and PC, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-trailer"><u>Xbox (and Game Pass)</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-ps4-and-ps5"><u>PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5</u></a> versions being added later, Team Cherry has been slowly ramping up the conversation around Silksong after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-hollow-knight-silksong-news-at-e3-2021"><u>going quiet for a long time</u></a>. It was announced a whopping six years ago almost to the day, and outside of the occasional pop-up, it has laid dormant since. The studio behind the Hollow Knight follow-up did promise that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-release-window-next-12-months"><u>launch would soon arrive back in 2022</u></a>, but as the months came and went, hope began to dwindle that Hollow Knight: Silksong would ever arrive - until recently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Cherry kicked off 2025 with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake">a mysterious tease related to a chocolate cake recipe</a>, leading desperate fans to hope that a re-reveal would arrive in April. Of course, we now know that, somehow, the riddle-solving Hollow Knight fans were right to expect a reveal alongside the Switch 2 Direct. Although today‚Äôs 2025 release window promise offered little in terms of actually showing what the game has to offer, it‚Äôs at least something to mark on your calendars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Time will tell if Team Cherry will finally be able to nail down a Hollow Knight: Silksong release date before the year is out.

Over on the official Nintendo store, the company is implementing some pre-order measures to ensure bona fide Switch players are getting their pre-orders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My Nintendo Store</a>, those with a Nintendo Account can register their interest in pre-ordering a Nintendo Switch 2 system and "select accessories" from the Nintendo Store. Those who express interest will then get an invitation email once their turn in line comes up, valid for 72 hours. The catch? You'll need to have put in some time on your old Switch, and been a Switch Online member.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Invitation emails will be prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis to registrants who have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership with a minimum of 12 months of paid membership and a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours, as of April 2, 2025," according to the fine print on the site.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo also notes that invitations are "non-transferable" and will be sent to email addresses associated with the Nintendo Account that registers interest. For the system and each accessory, there will also be a one-per-account limit during the invitation period. Currently on the site, you can express interest in either a base Nintendo Switch 2 system, or the one bundled with Mario Kart World.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Orders will be shipped after purchase, and the approximate shipping date will be provided when ordering. Nintendo also specifies: "Please note that release-day delivery is not guaranteed due to processing and shipment times."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While not said outright by Nintendo, all of these measures seem dedicated towards ensuring that someone buying a Switch 2 through this process is someone who wants to purchase and play a Switch 2 for themselves, rather than flip it online.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 Console Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Scalping has been a frequent problem for new releases of sought-after products.
