            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Palworld x Terraria update has launched, bringing fishing, salvaging, bigger towns, a Pal trust mechanic and more in one of the biggest patches the game has seen since its early access release last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Update v0.6.0 adds the collaboration with Terraria, Re-Logic’s hugely popular sandbox game. It includes a unique dungeon featuring enemies from Terraria, and the ability to collect materials in the dungeon to create equipment from the world of the game. The Moon Lord, a boss from Terraria, is now a raid boss in Palworld.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the Terraria content is just one part of the update itself. Not only are there PlayStation 5 dedicated servers, but a number of new features. These include fishing, a salvage system, three new types of islands, a Pal trust mechanic, and the level cap raising from 60 to 65. All that and more is detailed in the patch notes, below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld developer Pocketpair continues to release major updates to the game even as it battles Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s patent lawsuit. And the lawsuit has affected the game. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-developer-pocketpair-says-its-being-forced-to-patch-the-game-due-to-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-companys-lawsuit"><u>Pocketpair admitted that recent patches made changes to the game that were forced upon it as a result of the ongoing litigation</u></a>. As you’d perhaps expect, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-modders-are-restoring-mechanics-pocketpair-was-forced-to-patch-out-due-to-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-companys-patent-lawsuit">modders stepped in</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC early 2024, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-massive-profits-are-too-big-for-a-studio-with-our-size-to-handle"><u>couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated</u></a>. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>signing a deal with Sony</u></a> to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP. It later launched the game on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Palworld’s huge launch, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company went down the patent route. The companies want 5 million yen (approx $32,846) each plus late payment damages, as well as an injunction against Palworld that would block its release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood"><u>IGN sat down for an extended conversation with John “Bucky” Buckley, communications director and publishing manager for Palworld developer Pocketpair</u></a>. We spoke following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusation it used generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals. He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Palworld: Tides of Terraria update 0.6.0 patch notes:</h2><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>▼Terraria Collab!<br>・Terraria Dungeon<br>⤷ A unique dungeon featuring enemies from Terraria has been added!

Prices are down, panic-buying has cooled, and both duelists and collectors are feeling the benefits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But make no mistake, there are still plenty of premium pulls hidden in Yu-Gi-Oh's 2025 releases. Between <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OGB8?object_uuid=717a15a2-9469-45a2-9fba-9030d1843033&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Supreme Darkness</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xpqW?object_uuid=717a15a2-9469-45a2-9fba-9030d1843033&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alliance Insight</a>, we've seen the final wave of Quarter Century Secret Rares. And just this past week, Starlight Rares officially returned to the TCG, turning heads and inflating wishlists overnight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, since we're halfway through 2025, I've been busy taking stock of the most valuable cards you can still pull from Yu-Gi-Oh's 2025 boosters. It's time to d-d-d-duel!</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>10. Mulcharmy Purulia</strong></h3><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223410"><div id="223410" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mulcharmy Purulia</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This reprint of Mulcharmy Purulia is pretty pricey these days, reaching around $100 right now after its printing in Maxze of the Master.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has started to level off, but it was a sharp climb just a couple of months ago.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>9. Mitsurugui Ritual </strong></h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223411"><div id="223411" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mitsurugui Ritual </h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sitting at around $90 at the time of asking, this spell card is a dream for reptile-focused decks. The Supreme Darkness Quarter Century Super Rare version has recently dropped from $120 to $90, but it’s still expensive.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>8. Maiden of White</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223412"><div id="223412" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Maiden of White</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you managed to grab the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbJWb?object_uuid=717a15a2-9469-45a2-9fba-9030d1843033&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blue-Eyes White Destiny</a> structure deck, then good news – many of its cards are pretty pricey to get these days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maiden of White is going for around $90-100 right now, with first editions climbing to the $120s.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>7.

That art is gorgeous, and it’s going for around $100 on the secondary market (although some are asking for more).</p><h3 data-cy="title3">6. Maliss P March Hare</h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223414"><div id="223414" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Maliss P March Hare</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It never takes long for Yu-Gi-Oh cards to devolve into made-up words and random letters, but this one is worth checking your packs for. In fact, it’s the most valuable Secret Rare from this year’s Alliance Insight set.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">5. Dragon Master Lords</h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223415"><div id="223415" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dragon Master Lords</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A 5000 attack and defense creature that can’t be targeted by card effects?

Rimite Dragon Ether Beryl</h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223417"><div id="223417" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Rimite Dragon Ether Beryl</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We didn’t expect this badass dragon to be called Beryl, but this isn’t one to be laughed at. It’ll set you back $150 right now for its Monster Mayhem version, and it plays very, very nicely with Blue-Eyes White Dragon decks.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">2. Dark Magician Girl the Magician's Apprentice</h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223418"><div id="223418" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dark Magician Girl the Magician's Apprentice</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve enjoyed anything Yu-Gi-Oh over the years, you’ll know this one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Dark Magician Girl the Magician's Apprentice’s core stats are hardly awe-inspiring, collectors love her (I wonder why?) so her Quarter Century Secret Rare from <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xpqW?object_uuid=717a15a2-9469-45a2-9fba-9030d1843033&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alliance Insight</a> is fetching up to $170 right now at TCGPlayer and other secondary markets like eBay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's a lot of cash considering her <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgpLw?object_uuid=717a15a2-9469-45a2-9fba-9030d1843033&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secret Rare counterpart is just under $10 market</a> right now as well, but who am I to judge?</p><h3 data-cy="title3">1. Mulcharmy Meowls</h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223419"><div id="223419" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mulcharmy Meowls</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Quarter Century Secret Rare</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sorry Dark Magician Girl the Magician's Apprentice, your artwork is no longer the cutest on this list. The most valuable card of 2025 is the truly adorable Mulcharmy Meowls, which is going for upwards of $200.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Honorable Mention: Battles of Legend: Monster Mayhem</h3></div><div catalogid="8bcb8841-1029-47df-bf52-6501242fd83e" id="223473"><div id="223473" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Battles of Legend: Monster Mayhem</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Galatea-i, the Orcust Automaton</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, it’s too soon to draw any hard conclusions for the time being. These early prices are often inflated by hype, and the market tends to shift quickly. We'll be keeping a close eye on where these cards land once the dust settles, and the other eye on Duelist's Advance.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Find Valuable Yu-Gi-Oh Cards in 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">So your best bet of owning any of the above is simply through the secondary market, and buying individual cards standalone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, if you are in it for the love of the game, and fancy fleecing out for some shiny boosters in an attempt to pull some of the rarest cards going, this is where you can buy the latest 2025 Yu-Gi-Oh booster bundles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've mentioned the highest price sold as well, alongside the current listing price at the time of publication,so you have a good idea what the market is looking like at the moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for more TCG discussion and market watch updates?

The Dying Light: Retouched update includes visual enhancements, a remastered soundtrack, and more for players across PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S.

Franchise director Tymon Smektała said this update is more about improving the original experience without altering its system requirements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When I looked online the day after [the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dying-light-official-10th-anniversary-trailer"><u>update was announced</u></a>], my heart skipped a beat. Quite a few of you were expecting a full remaster of some sort,” Smektała explained in <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/ten-years-later-still-going-strong-dying-light-retouched-update-releasing-june-26" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a new blog post</u></a>. “So, let's set the record straight: the Retouched Update is about squeezing out even more from the Dying Light you already love. It’s not a complete overhaul or remaster.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the visual enhancements players can expect include improved textures, lighting, and shadows. You might notice a wooden fence has a bit more detail or that certain metal surfaces will reflect light more realistically, for example. Techland is especially proud of how some floors and cement walls look in Dying Light: Retouched, sharing images of stone paths that feature more depth than before.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dying Light: Retouched - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the audio department, original Dying Light composer Paweł Blaszczak returned to remaster the soundtrack. The entire soundtrack has been re-recorded on tape for Retouched, with new tracks, ambient sounds, and even hit reaction audio also remastered for this week’s update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of you have been asking in the last few months about the Retouched Update — where it was, why it was taking so long,” the post continued. “The honest answer is this: we were working with 10+ year old technology. Even with all the new experience we've gained over the years, figuring out how to apply those learnings to the original Dying Light engine while keeping everything stable was a challenge.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dying Light: Retouched update is less Techland reanimating a long-forgotten corpse and more of an example of that team delivering a surprise for a game that has somehow managed to stand the test of time. Despite <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/239140/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB</u></a> listing a player peak of only 45,876, the original Dying Light has hovered around the 12,000-player mark for the last year. Those are impressive numbers for a zombie game that mostly leans on its single-player offerings, and it’s even more impressive considering <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dying-light-2-stay-human">Dying Light 2: Stay Human</a>, which launched just three years ago, usually <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/534380/charts/#1w" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>struggles to break 10,000 players</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Dying Light story will continue with the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dying-light-the-beast"><u>Dying Light: The Beast</u></a>, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-set-for-august-with-gameplay-trailer-at-summer-game-fest-2025"><u>recently pinned down a release date</u></a> of August 22, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.
