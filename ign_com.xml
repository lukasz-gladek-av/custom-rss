He told me he felt “really good about it.” Three months later, perhaps to no-one’s surprise, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">GTA 6 was delayed to May 26, 2026</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What changed in those few months? That’s what I asked Zelnick in a new interview to coincide with Take-Two’s just-published financial results. He said that as GTA 6 got closer to launch, the need for more polish “became clear.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“As we get closer to completion of a title that’s seeking perfection, the needs or lack thereof, for continued polish become clear,” Zelnick said. “In this case there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure Rockstar Games achieves its creative vision with no limitations. And I supported of course that approach.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6’s delay outside Take-Two’s current financial year into the next is a blow for the company’s numbers in the short term, but Zelnick told me he still feels really good about what he has coming up, including Gearbox’s Borderlands 4, Hangar 13’s Mafia: The Old Country, and of course new games in its NBA 2K and WWE 2K franchises.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I feel really good about how Fiscal 26 looks sitting here today,” he said. “And while of course, delays pain me — how could they not? — the most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Jason Duval Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, the obvious next question is a repeat of what I asked Zelnick back in February: how confident are you that Rockstar will hit May 26, 2026? This time around, Zelnick sounded even more certain:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think historically when we set a specific date, generally speaking, we've been very good about reaching it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That, to me, is saying GTA 6 won't be delayed without actually saying it. Never say never, of course, but now GTA 6 has an actual release date, it would be a pretty big shock if it slipped again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of GTA 6 Trailer 2 and Rockstar's accompanying info-dump has sparked all sorts of speculation about what to expect from what is sure to be the biggest video game of all time. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-some-grand-theft-auto-fans-think-liberty-city-is-a-secret-location-in-gta-6"><u>Some GTA fans even think Liberty City may end up in GTA 6 either at launch or as post-launch DLC</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out, we’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2"><u>all the details we’ve discovered so far</u></a>, a roundup of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-70-brand-new-screenshots-reveal-the-characters-and-places-of-leonida"><u>70 brand new screenshots</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-look-even-better-on-ps5-pro-experts-give-their-verdict"><u>the expert opinion on how GTA 6 will look on PS5 Pro</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

This super detailed to-scale R2-D2 set was <a href="https://www.brickeconomy.com/set/75308-1/lego-star-wars-r2-d2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retired in January 2025</a>, but you can still pick it up for $221.27 (8% off). Star Wars has a long history with LEGO, dating back to 1999, and have released everything from child-friendly playsets to massive intricate models that look great on display. This R2-D2 falls in the latter camp, and its level of detail and size are a perfect addition to any Star Wars fan's collection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although this R2-D2 build was recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-day-deals-for-may-the-4th-2025">on sale of Star Wars Day</a>, we don't expect it to be below MSRP for much longer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Retired LEGO R2-D2 Is Still Available at Amazon</h2><div catalogid="af7af8dc-4424-4653-992c-669ada19362c" id="221034"><div id="221034" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO R2-D2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This 2,315-piece set is the most detailed iteration of R2-D2 LEGO has released to date. IGN actually <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-the-lego-r2-d2-a-challenging-build-with-an-adorable-result">had the chance to build this set</a> when it first came out and we loved putting it together. Standing at over a foot tall, you can pose R2 however you like and every feature from the movies you can imagine are all present here. The third leg R2 rolls around on is retractable, the front hatches can open and close, and the periscope comes out from R2's head. LEGO takes great care to get every detail right, and this set is one of the best examples of this. Every color, wire, tube, or light on R2's body is as screen-accurate as possible, and if you're able to grab this before it's gone, it goes great with some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-lego-sets">best LEGO Star Wars sets to build in 2025</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">R2-D2's most recent on-screen appearance was in 2021 on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-book-of-boba-fett-episode-6-review">Book of Boba Fett episode 6</a>. The episode, titled "From the Desert Comes a Stranger" is one of the most notable in the show as it features the return of a CGI de-aged Luke Skywalker, the first (and last) live-action appearance of bounty hunter Cad Bane, and of course our favorite blue and white astromech droid. We gave this episode a seven, saying that it was "less concerned with its protagonist than it is The Mandalorian and the repurposing of nostalgic Star Wars elements."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Recently Retired LEGO Sets on Amazon</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Once LEGO officially retires a set, they tend to hang around at other retailers for a bit longer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/board-games-like-dungeons-and-dragons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Dungeons &amp; Dragons is an iconic brand, a brand to contend with, a brand that’s launched a million fantasy campaigns across a million unique worlds of their player’s devising. Yet for all its popularity and success there are times when every player and dungeon master has thought: isn’t it all a bit too much work? Wouldn’t it be nice if we could have all the fun exploration, and exciting combat, and satisfying looting and levelling up without having to put in quite so much effort into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-dungeons-and-dragons">world-building and rules</a> overhead?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well the answer is yes: play a board game instead. There are dozens and dozens of board games that riff on the basic premise of the fantasy quest, but a large number of them are either too abstract to truly scratch that itch, or so complex that they’re essentially a lifestyle commitment in their own right. Here is a selection of titles between those two extremes that fit the bill perfectly, from licensed spin-offs to stone classics, for those nights when you want the fantasy, but you don’t want playing to be a heroic quest in its own right. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Want a clean list without the blurbs? The horizontally scrolling catalog above has you covered. But if you want some info about each of the games, read on.</p><p id="dd-waterdeep"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="D&amp;D Waterdeep">D&amp;D Waterdeep: Dungeon of The Mad Mage Adventure System</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220834"><div id="220834" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>D&amp;D Waterdeep: Dungeon of The Mad Mage Adventure System Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you really want a board game that re-creates the Dungeons &amp; Dragons experience, there’s no better place to start than the Adventure System games, which are literally a slimmed down version of the 4th edition rules in a box, with a board. There’s no DM to run the game: you pull tiles at random as you explore the dungeon and monsters behave according to simple, yet varied, AI routines printed on their cards. But there’s still a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">narrative campaign</a>, divided into individual scenarios, with secrets to uncover, monsters to kill, and treasures to loot. Dungeons of the Mad Mage is the most recent set, but there’s a range of these and they’re all a blast to play.</p></div><p id="heroquest-game-system"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="HeroQuest Game System">HeroQuest Game System</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220835"><div id="220835" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>HeroQuest Game System</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Although one of the fun things about D&amp;D board games is often the fact that you don’t need someone to take the DM’s role, having someone to narrate the experience and control the bad guys can make the experience richer for all involved. And if you do want to retain that role, this modern reprint of 1989 classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heroquest-buying-guide">HeroQuest</a> has you covered. Mechanically it’s almost exactly the same, with one player controlling the evil wizard and his minions, while the others are heroes, exploring a series of dungeons on their quest to gain experience and treasure and end the evil once and for all. As a bonus it’s also pretty simple, making a great choice for a parent to play with their kids (also see our picks for more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board games</a>).</p></div><p id="clank-legacy-acquisitions-incorpor"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Clank!

It has both the branding of the hugely popular Dungeons &amp; Dragons podcast Acquisitions Incorporated and the legacy structure meaning the game is a campaign that changes the components physically as you progress, ensuring your copy, and your adventures with it, are wholly unique. The game itself marries the exciting, chaotic deck construction and adventure of the original with a more considered, characterful narrative framework, full of surprises and humor. For more, see our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clank-board-game-buying-guide">Clank! buying guide</a>.</p></div><p id="dungeons-dragons-onslaught"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dungeons &amp; Dragons Onslaught">Dungeons &amp; Dragons Onslaught</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220837"><div id="220837" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Onslaught</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Adventure System games above tried to slim down 4th edition D&amp;D in a traditional adventure game format, Onslaught ports the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-dungeons-and-dragons-books">5th edition rules</a> into a skirmish board game where two adventuring parties fight for dominance in a dungeon room. While this isn’t exactly how the role-playing game tends to run, every player has had a full-on party-on-party clash at least once in their gaming career, and the game thoughtfully includes treasure chests to loot and characters to level to make it feel more authentic. Plus, the tabletop translation of the well-loved 5th edition rules is really engaging and tactically challenging.</p></div><p id="descent-legends-of-the-dark"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Descent: Legends of the Dark">Descent: Legends of the Dark</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220838"><div id="220838" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Descent: Legends of the Dark</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are an increasing number of modern adventure titles that farm the task of running the game out to an app, leaving players free to enjoy the mysteries and advance their characters through the campaign. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/descent-legends-of-the-dark-review">Descent: Legends of the Dark</a> is perhaps the most advanced in every respect. The app is very comprehensive, revealing dungeons, controlling monsters, narrating downtime and even tracking your resources to feed into an item construction feature. The physical components meanwhile, are outstanding, with a fully 3D cardboard dungeon and superbly detailed miniatures bringing the adventure to life on your tabletop. </p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-journeys-in-m"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in M">The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-Earth</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220839"><div id="220839" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-Earth</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Dungeons &amp; Dragons is well known to have counted Tolkien's epic novel amongst its inspirations. So a board game that includes both overland and dungeon adventures alongside combat and character advancement certainly counts as a parallel. Fortunately there’s a lot more to enjoy under the hood: this is another app-driven affair, letting the players focus on the fun, while also taking the time to challenge the group with puzzles and riddles that simply wouldn’t be possible in purely physical production. Set in the time between The Hobbit and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-books-reading-order">The Lord of the Rings books</a>, it allows players to create a little slice of Middle-earth that is all their own.</p></div><p id="tiny-epic-dungeons"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tiny Epic Dungeons">Tiny Epic Dungeons</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220840"><div id="220840" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tiny Epic Dungeons</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that unites all the picks so far – aside from their similarity to D&amp;D – is an eye-watering price-point. If you want a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">dungeon crawl</a> on the cheap, look no further than this cute entry in the popular Tiny Epic series, which consistently succeeds in shrinking big themes down into small boxes. A band of heroes ventures into a unique dungeon in an attempt to level up enough to challenge the boss, but they’re up against a tough timer as their torch burns down. With a snappy playtime and a novel combat system that gives you the chance to mitigate bad results, it really feels like a huge dungeon unfolds from this very modest box. </p></div><p id="gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion">Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220841"><div id="220841" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You might have heard of Gloomhaven and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/frosthaven-board-game-review">Frosthaven</a>, two of the – literally – biggest and most acclaimed board games around. What powers their popularity is the beguiling mix of adventure narrative, challenging tactics and novel mechanics, with each class given a unique deck of cards from which you have to mix and match two of your actions each turn. They’re both RPG-length campaigns in their own right but they have a little sibling, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion-review">Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</a>, which gives you all that mechanical goodness at a fraction of the cost and with a much more manageable campaign. Plus it’s a prequel, so if it gives you a taste for the longer fare you can jump right in and continue the story.</p></div><p id="legacy-of-dragonholt"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Legacy of Dragonholt">Legacy of Dragonholt</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220842"><div id="220842" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Legacy of Dragonholt</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re likely familiar with the concept of choose-your-own-adventure books, where you read a paragraph of text and make choices at the end about which numbered paragraph to flip to next, thereby telling your own version of the story. Legacy of Dragonholt expands that concept multifold and makes it multiplayer, creating a hugely detailed campaign with a dizzying number of options and branch points. Add in an activation token system that lets everyone have their place in decision making as well as some strategic nuance over what skills and abilities to deploy and you’ve got the ultimate text adventure to enjoy with friends, although it also works as a good <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a> for that classic old-school feel.</p></div><p id="betrayal-at-baldurs-gate"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate">Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220847"><div id="220847" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one’s a little different from the fantasy quest fare that dominates the rest of the list, but it still evokes the feeling of a certain kind of D&amp;D session and it has the Forgotten Realms branding, so it’s a close fit. Your team of heroes starts out working together to explore the cursed city of Baldur’s Gate by flipping tiles and looting items but, at some point, a haunt will begin. This is revealed from a narrative book which will give you the win conditions for your game and often pits one player as a traitor, working against the others. It’s an exciting setup with tons of variety that often boils down to a thrilling conclusion of heroism trying to win out against the encroaching darkness.</p></div><p id="dd-bedlam-in-neverwinter"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="D&amp;D: Bedlam in Neverwinter">Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Bedlam in Neverwinter</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220848"><div id="220848" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Bedlam in Neverwinter</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another off-the-wall pick that focuses on the puzzle aspects of dungeoneering over the adventure, this is an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-escape-room-board-games">escape-room style board game</a> which sees you having to figure out a variety of traps, tricks and riddles as you investigate a mystery in the iconic Icewind Dale setting. It’s aimed at all ages, and is only playable once, after which you can trade or sell it, but it’s got a unique spin on the genre which mixes in some simplistic exploration, role-playing opportunities and combat mechanics for that real <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-board-games">tabletop RPG</a> flavor, and the unfolding narrative builds toward an epic conclusion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance writer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

Publisher A Plus unveiled the new MMORPG today, and it's set for launch sometime in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blue Protocol: Star Resonance is an anime-inspired MMORPG, with action combat and an open world to explore, targeting PC on both Steam and the Epic Games Store, as well as iOS and Android. Currently, the game is set to launch in Europe, North America, and Latin America sometime in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/free-to-play-mmorrpg-blue-protocol-star-resonance-coming-west-in-2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gematsu</a>, Blue Protocol: Star Resonance was previously only announced for China. It was licensed to Bokura, the developer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namcos-cancelled-mmorpg-blue-protocol-is-coming-back-as-star-resonance" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">after the closure of Blue Protocol</a> and picked up some members of the original team in the process. Now, Star Resonance looks to be heading to new territories.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You'd be forgiven for thinking Blue Protcol: Star Resonance is the original Blue Protocol, as the gameplay and world <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI_qVWHiHnQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">look very similar</a>. The original Blue Protocol was a collaboration between Amazon Games and Bandai Namco. The MMORPG went live in Japan and was planned for a worldwide release. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-protocol-preview-living-out-my-anime-action-dreams">IGN even previewed it in 2023</a>, calling it "gorgeous" and "cool."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then in 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/worldwide-release-cancelled-for-amazon-games-live-service-mmo-blue-protocol">Bandai Namco announced it was cancelling the worldwide launch</a> and would discontinue service for Blue Protocol by January 18, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of Blue Protocol, and both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world,” Bandai Namco said in a statement at the time. “We have worked hard to prepare for the release; however, we have come to the conclusion that it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cut to now, and Blue Protocol: Star Resonance bears all the hallmarks of Blue Protocol. There's the anime-inspired aesthetic, action combat, character customization, and community events. This, in essence, may just be the return of Blue Protocol for those who were interested in seeing it arrive in the west.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this news might feel like seeing the ghost of old games past, it might be some good news for anyone who didn't get the chance to try Blue Protocol before its closure. Maybe the second time's the charm? We'll know for sure when Blue Protocol: Star Resonance arrives sometime this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
