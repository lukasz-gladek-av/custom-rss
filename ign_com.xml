"We said this place would be full again," it began. "Thanks to our players, athletes, and fans for filling the house with us. Let‚Äôs keep that kick off energy going ‚Äòtil College Football 26 drops this summer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA Sports didn't reveal the cover stars, a specific release date, or any other details, though as College Football 25 arrived in July last year, it likely won't be long before fans find out more.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We said this place would be full again ‚Äì thanks to our players, athletes, and fans for filling the house with us.</p><p>Let‚Äôs keep that kick off energy going ‚Äòtil College Football 26 drops this summer üòâ <a href="https://t.co/6lbfS1zAsd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6lbfS1zAsd</a></p></div>‚Äî EASPORTSCollege (@EASPORTSCollege) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSCollege/status/1879951843591438446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It arrived as the first franchise entry in 11 years and was immediately successful, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-is-off-to-a-strong-start-ahead-of-its-official-release">pulling in as many as 700,000 players in its first day of early access</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/22-million-people-were-willing-to-pay-100-to-play-college-football-25-3-days-early">a staggering 2.2 million by the end</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It later closed 2024 as the best selling sports video game in U.S. history in terms of dollar sales, putting it above even the professional league Madden NFL franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-review">In our 7/10 review</a>, IGN said: "College Football 25 nails the on-field action with a dynamic feel, stellar graphics, and tons of smart gameplay tweaks. However, so much of what's off the field feels unfinished, with UI issues and barebones modes that seem like they are waiting for a rebuild next season."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

I am grateful to the development team for their cooperation in optimizing the game until the very last moment. I hope many people will experience Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Steam Deck.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth doesn‚Äôt have its own PlayStation 4 port, it‚Äôs surprising to see it gain the coveted Steam Deck Verified badge, a feat that mainline <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-review"><u>Final Fantasy 16</u></a> couldn‚Äôt manage to achieve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, to celebrate, Square-Enix created three ‚Äúspecially crafted‚Äù Steam Deck units; but these are no simple custom case or repaint job, they're full-on Chocobo makeovers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Flocked with the Chocobo‚Äôs iconic yellow fluffy fur, feathers, and beak, one of these custom Steam Deck units was shown off in an official video, below. However, Square Enix warned: "we don‚Äôt advise trying to wrap high-tech gaming gear in fur at home."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Three of the furry Steam Decks were created, and on further inspection, they appear to be built on a Steam Deck OLED model (you can tell from the color of each analog stick). But you can‚Äôt help but question how practical it would be to game on the Chocobo Steam Deck, given that all of the feathers and flocking might get in the way. However, Square Enix has left the fan intake open at the rear, so the system can breathe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If your mouth waters at the prospect of playing a 100-hour RPG on a furry Steam Deck, Square-Enix has teased on social media that it will run some kind of giveaway or competition so a few lucky fans can get their hands on one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth's Steam Deck verification reinforced the idea the game will eventually make its way to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name">the just-announced Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Indeed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-games-reportedly-set-for-release-on-nintendo-switch-2">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is reportedly set for Nintendo Switch in 2026</a>, after Final Fantasy 7 Remake hits the console this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth launches on PC on January 23.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sayem is a freelancer based in the UK, covering tech &amp; hardware.
