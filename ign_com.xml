            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I was very sad to step away."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Desmond's death in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-iii">Assassin's Creed 3</a> was ambiguous enough that voice actor Nolan North didn't realize he'd just recorded the character's last gasp — and now, North has said that the series' original modern day protagonist is "technically" still alive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">North played Desmond in five games until the character's big sacrifice at the end of 2012's Assassin's Creed 3. But despite stepping up to save the world — and collapsing in the process — Desmond's death scene apparently only clicked with North after he checked Twitter following the game's launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That technically was Desmond's death scene, and I didn't know it," North told <a href="https://youtu.be/eEipR4kRQIE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fall Damage</a>. "I found out on Twitter. 'Are you upset Desmond's dead?' And I'm thinking, what? Because there's no 'Argh!' There's nothing that you'd expect from a main character's death, although the good people at Ubisoft have told me that he's not technically dead."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here, North is likely referring to the ending of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>, where the actor returned to the franchise as a mysterious character named The Reader. Valhalla makes it pretty clear that The Reader is Desmond — or his consciousness which now lives on inside the Animus, at least. And, seemingly, Ubisoft has confirmed this to North.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Desmond's death (or his physical body's demise, at any rate) came as a surprise to some fans who'd followed the character since the franchise's origins. But Ubisoft developers have said that as the Assassin's Creed series grew in scope, each game began to struggle to onboard new players. Following the end of Desmond's arc, the series experimented with other ideas for its modern day sections, and currently pushes players directly into the historical action instead.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think the original idea was eight or nine games with Desmond," North continued, referencing Ubisoft's ever-changing original plans for the Assassin's Creed series, "but, as it so often goes in the entertainment industry, different developers, different creative directors come in, and they have their own way of continuing the story — and it's done very, very well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was very sad to step away from the role of Desmond," he concluded, "because Assassin's Creed is one of my favorite stories I've ever been part of."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A recent report suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stop-removing-the-modern-day-assassins-creed-fans-react-as-black-flag-remake-reportedly-cuts-everything-outside-the-animus">Ubisoft was planning to remove the modern day section from its widely-rumored Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake</a>, and bolster the game's historical sections instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As the messy breakdown between Krafton and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/subnautica-2"><u>Subnautica 2</u></a> developer and subsidiary Unknown Worlds goes to court this week, an explosive new legal filing claims that Krafton's CEO discussed a takeover of the studio in Slack messages, and allegedly even turned to ChatGPT "to help him brainstorm ways to avoid paying the earnout."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-developers-entire-leadership-team-replaced-in-shock-move-krafton-said-will-bring-renewed-energy-and-momentum"><u>Unknown Worlds' entire leadership was fired</u></a> amid a messy public falling out over a $250 million bonus from parent company, Krafton. For months now, most coverage about the sequel has concerned the painful breakdown between Unknown Worlds' founders and Krafton, which<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pubg-parent-company-buys-subnautica-studio"><u> acquired Unknown Worlds in October 2021</u></a>. Over the summer, reports came to light that Subnautica 2's early access release was delayed to 2026 just months before Krafton was due to pay <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/more-drama-in-the-murky-world-of-subnautica-2-as-official-delay-confirmation-comes-hot-on-the-heels-of-damaging-report-into-now-unlikely-250m-bonus"><u>a $250 million bonus to the development team</u></a> "against the wishes of the studio’s former leadership."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/krafton-responds-to-ex-subnautica-2-leads-lawsuit-saying-they-resorted-to-litigation-to-demand-a-payday-they-havent-earned"><u>Krafton issued a response to the lawsuit filed by former leads of Subnautica 2</u></a>, Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, offering rebuttals to the developers' claims and alleging they "resorted to litigation to demand a multimillion-dollar payout they haven't earned." Then, last month, Unknown Worlds itself sued its founders Cleveland, former CEO Ted Gill, and studio co-founder Max McGuire for allegedly stealing game design files shortly before they were fired. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in new legal <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/950200391/Public-Version-Plaintiff-s-Pre-Trial-Brief" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>paperwork</u></a>, the founders allege Krafton CEO CH Kim and Unknown Worlds newly-appointed CFO Richard Yoon discussed a potential takeover over Slack, and allegedly used ChatGPT for ideas on how to get out of paying the bonus, and set up a "secret task force" to take over the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In the lead-up to this decision, Krafton CEO CH Kim had become frustrated with the contract Krafton signed to acquire Unknown Worlds. From his seat, it had become a bad deal for Krafton — one 'under which [Krafton] can only be dragged around,'" the filing states.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Krafton created a secret task force called 'Project X' whose mandate was simple: either make a 'deal' with the Founders on the 'earnout' or execute a 'Take Over' of Unknown Worlds. When the Founders refused to accede to Krafton’s demands, Krafton pulled the trigger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"> "[Maria Park, Krafton's global head of corporate development] told Kim that ‘it seems to be highly likely that the earn-out will still be paid if the sales goal is achieved regardless of the dismissal with cause,'” the new filing adds. “Kim turned to artificial intelligence to help him brainstorm ways to avoid paying the earnout. ChatGPT likewise advised that it would be ‘difficult to cancel the earn-out.'” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cofounders allege that Krafton refused to "produce the ChatGPT conversations," later claiming "they no longer exist.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The filing also seeks to bolster Unknown Worlds' claims that Subnautica 2 was indeed ready for its planned soft launch, stating that Unknown Worlds’ playtest data, presented to Krafton in May, "showed that the game met players’ expectations." Furthermore, Krafton’s "own internal expert declared that the planned 2025 release would be best (and that firing Ted Gill would result in a multi-year development delay)," and Maria Park wrote "the game was ready for an August launch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement to press, Krafton said: "There is nothing more important to us than ensuring the players get the best possible experience. We are looking forward to highlighting that all of our decisions have been focused on ensuring Subnautica 2 exceeds the high expectations that come from our players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were forced to make a change when the former leaders showed little interest in the development of Subnautica 2, which has always been our top priority. Now, this trial comes down to plaintiffs asking to be restored to jobs they were not doing, said they had no interest in doing, and had previously declined requests that they come back and do those jobs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Krafton remains focused on what matters: delivering the best possible game to Subnautica’s fans."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Subnautica 2 itself? Developer Unknown Worlds recently shared <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-legal-drama-over-250-million-bonus-new-developer-vlog-shows-work-on-subnautica-2-continues"><u>a behind-the-scenes look at an all-new deep-sea predator</u></a>, and "how the team has used Unreal Engine 5 AI for lifelike behavior, real-time reactions and tense encounters for player." The 10-minute vlog is one of the first development updates we've had since the legal wrangling began over the summer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzles-are-buy-1-get-1-half-off-at-amazon-today.1356436/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a lot of different <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">jigsaw puzzle brands</a> out there, but one of my overall favorites is The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzles">Magic Puzzle Company</a>. What really makes them stand out is how unique their approach to puzzling is. Each piece is odd and interesting, and the puzzles themselves feature a secret ending you can only uncover once you've fully completed it. True to its name, these puzzles feel like a mix of magic and puzzling as you're making your way through them. Although they usually cost $25 each, Amazon is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKqWxG?object_uuid=fd753bb1-dd12-4a56-8d3a-aec644008373&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>currently running a buy 1, get 1 50% off sale</strong></a> that includes quite a few of them. If you've been looking for a good <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-gifts">gift to buy the puzzle fanatic</a> in your life, I'd definitely recommend checking these out while the sale lasts.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic Puzzle Company Sale at Amazon (Buy 1, Get 1 50% Off)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of the Magic Puzzle Company puzzles is 1,000 pieces and features artwork from different artists around the world. There are hidden Easter eggs in every puzzle and the secret endings are all unique and interesting. There have been 13 Magic Puzzle Company puzzles released across five different series so far, but only eight of them are part of Amazon's early Black Friday promotion. Series One and Series Two are underrepresented here, but many of the newer releases are eligible for the discount.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most notably, the <em>only</em> Series Five puzzle that's been released so far is included in this sale. The Drippy Trip <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-series-five-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzle-features-art-from-an-adventure-time-designer">came out back in early August</a> and features some interesting ties to the animated series Adventure Time. I haven't had the chance to put this one together myself, but as a fan of that show I can't help but admire the resemblance to Adventure Time artwork I've grown to love.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should you wait for Amazon's Black Friday sale?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you aren't keeping up with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-predictions-and-latest-news">Black Friday sale dates</a> as closely as I am, it's worth noting that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-2025-start-date-and-sale-predictions">Amazon Black Friday sale</a> actually starts on Thursday this week. While I do recommend taking advantage of this discount right now, there's no guarantee that there won't be a better deal once that sale actually kicks off. I'd expect at least <em>some</em> of the Magic Puzzle Company puzzles to get discounted during Black Friday, but we won't know which ones until Thursday (or next week even).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that in mind, this sale is definitely worth checking out if you're looking to buy more than one puzzle at once. You may be able to find a lower price on some of these next week, but the extra 50% off now isn't likely to last forever. Amazon launched a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-early-black-friday-book-sale-2025">similar sale on books last week</a> that has already ended, so it's probable this week's promotion will expire before we even get to Black Friday as well. You may want to check out some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-buy-1-get-1-half-off-board-game-sale-ahead-of-black-friday-2025">board games included in these early Black Friday deals</a> while you're at it.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzles-early-black-friday-sale-2025]]></content:encoded>
