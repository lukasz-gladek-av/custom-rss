Generative AI often struggles with hands, adding extra fingers where they shouldn't be.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/09/santa-claus-1733746080205.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Black Ops 6's 'Necroclaus' loading screen. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another image of a gloved hand was used to show off a new Zombies community event. It contained what looked like six fingers with no thumb on-screen, suggesting up to seven digits on this hand.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/25/bo6-1740485655900.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The central image includes a gloved hand with some odd things going on. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of the Zombie Santa image sparked a closer look at other images in Black Ops 6, which some in the Call of Duty community subsequently called into question. Redditor Shaun_LaDee highlighted three images included in paid bundles that have irregularities that could suggest the use of generative AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans then called on Activision to disclose the use of generative AI for art that is included in bundles that are sold, and following new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>AI disclosure rules</u></a> for Steam, it has now added a vague disclosure that covers the entirety of Black Ops 6 on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6’s Steam AI Generated Content Disclosure reads: “Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wired</u></a> reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-reportedly-sold-an-ai-generated-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-cosmetic"><u>Activision sold an “AI-generated cosmetic” for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 last year</u></a>. The cosmetic in question was not named, but was linked to the Yokai’s Wrath bundle released in December 2023. The store did not disclose any use of generative AI for this bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle cost 1,500 COD Points, the premium virtual currency sold for real-world money that generates hundreds of millions of dollars for Activision each year. 1,500 COD Points is approximately valued at $15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wired pointed out that Microsoft, which owns Activision Blizzard after its $69 billion acquisition of the company last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce"><u>cut 1,900 staff from its gaming business</u></a> just months after Activision sold this skin. The report alleged that 2D artists’ jobs were being replaced by AI at the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of 2D artists were laid off,” one anonymous Activision artist told the site. “Remaining concept artists were then forced to use AI to aid in their work.” Activision employees were allegedly “made” to sign up for AI training, with its use promoted throughout the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. Generative AI thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-developer-bloober-signs-deal-for-another-game-for-konami-could-it-be-more-silent-hill<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloober Team has announced it has signed a deal with Konami to make a new game based on the Japanese company’s IP, following the successful release of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While neither Bloober nor Konami said what the game is, or which franchise it’s in, given Bloober’s expertise with horror games and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-hails-silent-hill-2-remake-after-hitting-2-million-sales-milestone">the success of the 2 million-selling Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, another Silent Hill game of some type seems likely. Bloober said Konami will continue as both the publisher and rights holder of the mystery game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb from Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno:</p><blockquote>Konami, a legendary name in the gaming industry, sought a partner who could breathe new life into one of its most iconic franchises — Silent Hill. Bloober Team was selected for their expertise in horror and atmospheric storytelling, and in 2021, both companies signed a partnership agreement. In October 2022, during the official Silent Hill Transmission livestream, it was announced that Bloober Team was working on a remake of Silent Hill 2, widely regarded as one of the best psychological horror games in history. </blockquote><blockquote>The success of the remake proved that Bloober Team had perfectly captured the atmosphere and depth of the original while introducing crucial innovations. The game was well-received by players, earning an 86/100 rating on Metacritic and an 88/100 on OpenCritic, along with numerous awards, including Game of the Year 2024 from IGN Japan and Best Horror Game of the Year from the IGN Community Awards.</blockquote><blockquote>The trust built upon the success of Silent Hill 2 laid the foundation for signing another agreement for a new project. The deal aligns with Bloober Team’s strategic plan to expand its internal development division within a first-party framework. </blockquote><blockquote>Our collaboration with Konami has been incredibly fruitful, and the success of Silent Hill 2 speaks for itself. By sharing knowledge and experience, we have been able to create high-quality production together. Of course, we can't reveal too many details at this time, but we are confident that fans will be just as excited about our collaboration as we are. We can't wait to share something truly special with players when the time is right.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill 2 remake went on sale on PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam on October 8, 2024 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-console-exclusive-to-ps5-for-1-year"><u>there’s no word on an Xbox Series X and S version</u></a> yet), and just a few days later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-1-million-copies-in-less-than-a-week"><u>had sold one million copies</u></a>. This was thought to have made Silent Hill 2 remake the fastest-selling Silent Hill game ever, but Konami has yet to rubber stamp that potential record.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review"><u>Silent Hill 2 remake review</u></a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Silent Hill 2 is a great way to visit – or revisit – one of the most dread-inducing destinations in the history of survival horror.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sales success of the Silent Hill 2 remake has clearly strengthened Konami’s plans for the franchise, which have ramped up significantly in recent years. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f"><u>Silent Hill f</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-townfall"><u>Silent Hill: Townfall</u></a> are both still in the works, but perhaps Konami will also continue to remake past Silent Hill games. There's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-movie-first-look-pyramid-head"><u>a film adaptation of Silent Hill 2</u></a> coming, too. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/early-silent-hill-2-remake-mods-remove-hair-sheen-the-fog-and-even-turn-the-game-into-sunny-hills"><u>modders are doing eye-catching things with the Silent Hill 2 remake on PC</u></a>, including removing hair sheen, the game’s famous fog, and even turning it into Sunny Hills.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, what is this new Bloober game for Konami? If it’s a new Silent Hill game, is it a remake of a previous game, or a brand new game in the franchise?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Silent Hill 2 remake features several new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/silent-hill-2-remake/Puzzle_Guide"><u>puzzles</u></a> and redesigned maps, so if you need help navigating through it all, head to our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/silent-hill-2-remake/Walkthrough"><u>Silent Hill 2 Walkthrough Hub</u></a>.
