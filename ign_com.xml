During this campaign, you’ll fight a tank battle under the shadows of the Pyramids, take to the streets of Brooklyn for intense gunfights, perform a HALO jump into enemy territory, and more in this modern military thriller.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Along the way, you’ll assume the role of members of Dagger 13, confronting inner and outer turmoil as they seek to accomplish their mission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"True to Battlefield, your squad is the key to accomplishing your mission in Single Player. You’ll be able to command the rest of Dagger 13 to engage enemy forces as a group in order to suppress them as you reposition to snipe, flank them, or take out multiple foes with a well-thrown grenade. Additionally, as you step into the well-worn boots of different members of the squad, you’ll be able to take advantage of their respective abilities and talents to gain the upper hand when engaging the enemy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Battlefield 6’s Single Player and Multiplayer take place in an interconnected world, with Dagger 13’s mission taking them to locales and battles that players will be experiencing in the series’ iconic All-Out Warfare multiplayer modes, where NATO’s remaining forces wage war against Pax Armata."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 is due out October 10, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-everything-announced">everything announced during State of Play September 2025</a> to find out what else is coming to PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Developing…</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
