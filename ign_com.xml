His phantom versions can pop out and surprise you throughout the campaign, and it seems like that particular facet of Morgott made it into Nightreign, where an unnamed Fell Omen (essentially an upgraded Morgott) can jump-scare invade players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Morgott isn't the only boss that can invade your squad as you run through Nightreign, he is a very fitting invader. Not only does it line up with his surprise appearances in Elden Ring, but he even gets some extra voice lines and a few new moves to throw at you. If you get to bring two pals to the fight, it's only fair Morgott gets some new moves!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While he can invade you, the Fell Omen can also appear as an end-of-night boss, one of the conclusive fights you can face as the sun sets in the Elden Ring Nightreign test.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">How did morgott even manage to sneak into nightreign to fight us. generational hater this is like the 5th time <a href="https://t.co/t7euCmkBRy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/t7euCmkBRy</a></p>— Nightreign Countdown (@SoulsCountdowns) <a href="https://twitter.com/SoulsCountdowns/status/1890945931912036486?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Plenty of early testers, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-elden-ring-community-hero">including the player behind Let Me Solo Her</a>, took on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3wS3s5omcW0?si=v92LESpAKaVPlKie&amp;t=2070" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Fell Omen during the Elden Ring Nightreign sessions</a> that took place over the weekend. The consensus? Morgott/Margit/Fell Omen is a great hater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1iqdsxs/strangest_or_most_challenging_locations_to_have/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One player on the Elden Ring Nightreign subreddit</a> described Morgott's invasion mechanic as one of their favorite features, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1iqa3pv/chances_he_can_invade_you_at_any_point_in/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in more threads</a>, others shared where they were invaded. Whether as a night boss, on an elevator, or in a tower, Morgott seems ready to appear wherever, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zulliethewitch.bsky.social/post/3licizequas2i" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with some potentially hilarious consequences</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fell Omen's sudden invasions have hopes high for other enemies to suddenly appear and attack the players. The Pursuer from Dark Souls 2, for example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1iqa3pv/comment/mczm1t4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">would make a great candidate</a>. Me, personally? I'd love to see some Hunters invade and attempt to take out players, but anything Bloodborne-related feels like a distant hope at best.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>They buffed Margit in Elden Ring Nightreign bro was training with Vergil </p><p>Thankful for the one match I was able to play LOL <a href="https://t.co/4RRQGSKmNa" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/4RRQGSKmNa</a></p></div>— skum (@skumnut) <a href="https://twitter.com/skumnut/status/1890540573884301633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">There might even be deeper mechanics to Fell Omen invasions. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/the-random-events-in-elden-ring-nightreign-are-the-funniest-thing-fromsoftwares-ever-cooked-up-from-a-rain-of-ants-to-morgott-jump-scares/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a> detailed an invasion from the Omen that took out one of their co-op partners, and seemed to leave a curse mark branded on the slain player.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-hackers-tear-through-billions-of-possibilities-to-debunk-a-15-year-old-record-speedrun-no-one-thought-could-be-beaten<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Speedrunning has been a time-honored tradition of video game enjoyers for years, with some records being held not just for months or years, but even decades. One particular legendary Diablo run, though, has been the subject of scrutiny, an intense investigation, and now a thorough debunking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2009, Maciej "Groobo" Maselewski recorded an Any% segmented run, as the Sorcerer, made up of 27 segments. The final time, at three minutes and 12 seconds, appeared on Speed Demos Archive, where no concerns were raised, and was subsequently published on February 26, 2009. It would garner two Guinness World Record entries, and Diablo speedrun attempts would proceed to decline as the run seemed nigh-impossible to challenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the years went on, though, scepticism arose. In 2024, speedrunner Funkmastermp approached Allan "dwangoAC" Cecil to create a Tool-Assisted Speedrun, or TAS, of Diablo. Longtime Games Done Quick viewers will recognize dwangoAC as team leader for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/04/sgdqs-most-mindblowing-speedrun-wasnt-humanly-possible">TASBot</a>, the fun mascot that would appear during TAS blocks at GDQ's charity events.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team got to work, and <a href="https://diablo.tas.bot/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as detailed in a lengthy writeup by dwangoAC and other team members</a>, started to discover inconsistencies as they attempted to replicate Groobo's run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We just had a lot of curiosity and resentment that drove us to dig even deeper," team member Staphen told <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-diablo-hackers-that-debunked-a-record-speedrun/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ars Technica in a report detailing their investigation</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because Diablo uses seeds to generate maps, it should theoretically have been possible to replicate Groobo's run. To discover the seed Groobo used, the TAS team <a href="https://github.com/Matthew-petroff/diablo-mapgen" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built a custom map tool</a> that could reverse-engineer game seeds and determine the map, item, and quest possibilities therein. Then, a scanner tool built on top of it could sift through all the seeds and search for dungeons that might suit speedrunners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team searched across roughly 2.2 billion RNG seeds, attempting to recreate Groobo's run, and couldn't find one that imitated all the seemingly perfect generation. It seemed to indicate this wasn't made up of segments from a single file or run, but from different runs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The deeper they dug, the more oddities popped up; strange version markers in the main menu, inconsistent inventories, quests, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a final conclusion, the team said its discoveries demonstrate Groobo used "illegitimate means to produce the results shown in the run," including combining gameplay from different runs, modifying memory, and using "gameplay-removing video splices."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Overall, the team's analysis conclusively reveals the run was not possible as Groobo described without disqualifying modifications," the team said. "The run should therefore be immediately retracted from all leaderboards."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The writeup goes on to detail a response from Groobo, who told <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-hacker-who-hunts-video-game-speedrunning-cheaters/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wired</a>: "My run is a segmented/spliced run. It always has been and it was never passed off as anything else, nor was it part of any competition or leaderboards. The speeddemosarchive page states that outright."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The investigation team presented its analysis to Speed Demos Archive, which then discussed the findings independently with Groobo. On September 10, 2024, SDA posted an update announcing the removal of all Diablo runs by Groobo. The Diablo speedrunning community, meanwhile, kicked back into gear and started setting new records.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At a presentation, as reported by Ars Technica, dwangoAC said he pursued the investigation because "it did harm."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Groobo's alleged cheating in 2009 completely stopped interest in speedrunning this category," Cecil said. "No one tried, no one could."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's a record he set himself last June at one hour, 25 minutes, and 11 seconds. He'd spent days — 72, at the time of this incident — trying to topple his own record.

"That's a new one, dude," he said in a run prior to the big one, where his webcam turned off about one minute and 34 seconds in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The heartbreaker in question would happen after, at 23 minutes and 59 seconds into a really solid run. You can check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svH7ru0XzWQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube VOD</a> of his run to see the chat, in real-time, react. "This could be the funniest WR," one person in chat said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The facecam is crucial because it's required for the run to be valid. On <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/sm64ce?h=Blindfolded-70-star&amp;x=xd17xo7d-38do6x0l.814d20e1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Speedrun.com rules and regulations</a>, it specifically states: "The player must be visibly devoid of sight during the gameplay, i.e. something must be covering the eyes." Ergo, if you couldn't verify Bubzia had his eyes covered the entire time, the run would not qualify.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having a back-up of some kind, like a notification, might be a thought. But the second category-specific rule says runners can't have any assistance from other people. This includes hints from a Discord call or text-to-voice chat. After the first webcam failure, Bubzia confirmed he had "everything disabled" to alert him in case of a failure, and had received multiple Discord DMs trying to catch his attention while running.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some viewers, it might be agonizing to watch someone run a game for over an hour, unaware their attempt has been invalid since the 24-minute mark. Bubzia's chat even leaned into the irony, hoping for the runner to <em>not </em>set a world record, to avoid the heartbreak when the blindfold came off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So in that way, it may have been a relief that Bubzia's time came in a few seconds behind the world record. The pace clock concluded at 1:26:09, almost a full minute behind Bubzia's standing record.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If this would have been world record, I would have cried," Bubzia said, after taking off his blindfold and realizing the facecam had been off. "Dude, I would have quit SM64, man." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can follow more attempts from Bubzia, whose facecam is currently working at the time of this writing, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Bubzia" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on his Twitch here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/why-you-should-play-monster-hunter-world-before-wilds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As one of Steam’s most pre-ordered games right now, we know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is going to be massive. We also know that Wilds will be some people’s first Monster Hunter game. While we’re sure it will have a solid enough tutorial for newcomers, the series is undeniably dense and complex, and so if Wilds is your first go at hunting monsters you may find value in trying one of the previous games first. So before hopping into the vast and dangerous expanse of Monster Hunter Wilds, there’s one game we really recommend you check out: 2018’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don’t recommend Wold because of some big narrative tie-in or cliffhanger ending that will leave you lost and confused when you embark on Wild's central plotline. We suggest it simply because Monster Hunter: World is the game that most closely resembles Wilds’ style and structure. Playing World is a great way to onboard yourself and prepare for the sometimes obtuse systems and gameplay loop the series lives and thrives on.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/11/08/monsterhunterworld-blogroll-1516867463450-1667927878979.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Monster Hunter: World shares much in common with the upcoming Monster Hunter Wilds. | Image credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Monster Hunter: World?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve kept up with Capcom’s recent releases, you might already be asking, “Should I not play <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, the most recent game in the series, rather than go back to Monster Hunter: World?” It’s a valid question. But while Rise is the most recent Monster Hunter (and a very good game!), it's clear that Monster Hunter Wilds is a direct successor to 2018’s World rather than 2021’s Rise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rise may have refined the series’ signature gameplay with rideable mounts, the high-flying Wirebug grapple mechanic, and a few other flashy tricks, but they arrived at the expense of some of the larger and more layered seamless zones that World boasted. You see, while Rise is available on every platform these days, it was originally built for the Nintendo Switch, and that console’s more modest specs informed several of the creative decisions. This resulted in an emphasis on speed and smaller scale zones, which expedited the hunt-upgrade-hunt gameplay loop but lost some of the larger scale and fascinating friction of World. It is those elements that Rise dropped that Wilds seems to be trying to recapture and build upon. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>World feels like the blueprint that Wilds’ much larger open areas are drawing from. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter: World features large zones and an emphasis on tracking monsters and other living beings through a detailed ecosystem, and so World feels like the blueprint that Wilds’ much larger open areas are drawing from. This is why we believe World is the perfect game to prepare you for what’s to come. Those more open zones, which act as stages for long, thrilling hunts stretched across wide swathes of varied terrain, is where modern Monster Hunter shines. We expect Wilds to deliver on all that, but why wait when you can get an early, informative taste of it in World?  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite seeming like a direct successor, it’s important to note that Monster Hunter Wilds’ story isn't a continuation of the tale told in World. However, World’s approach to story and campaign structure will set your expectations appropriately for the direction of Wilds’ story. You’ll meet staple organizations like the Hunter’s Guild governing body, as well as your adorable feline sidekicks, the Palicos, all of which will be present in Wilds. However, these elements will be wholly unconnected from previous (and, most likely, future) entries. Think of all this as being like the Final Fantasy series, in which each entry is known to feature your bearded friend Cid, a massive Behemoth, bright yellow Chocobos, and other defining monsters roaming throughout the land, but all the games are distinct and unconnected, which allows every entry to put its own stamp on classic ideas.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Practice, Practice, Practice</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Above and beyond getting a preliminary understanding of the Monster Hunter universe and how the Wilds’ campaign will be structured, the strongest case for playing Monster Hunter: World first lies in the game's challenging combat. Monster Hunter Wilds’ action is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Weapons">built around 14 weapons</a>, each with their own playstyle and strategies. All 14 of them are also present in Monster Hunter: World, which means you can get a headstart on becoming comfortable with the eclectic systems that govern this series’ genuinely one-of-a-kind combat. Diving into World is a great way to familiarize yourself with each weapon’s techniques and decide which one suits your personal tastes and playstyle the best. Whether it's the quick and flashy dual-blades or the hulking greatsword, each weapon in Monster Hunter is distinct and demands focus to master. So consider Monster Hunter: World a training ground where you can learn weapon basics and build up proficiency. By the time you get to Wilds, you’ll be well on your way to becoming a master of your craft. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/10/31/monster-hunter-world-pgw-01-26267147179-o-1509411295879.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Learning the intricacies of bows, swords, and switch axes is a big part of Monster Hunter. | Image credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the Monster Hunter series your weapon is everything. You don't level up and gain skill points through experience or other traditional RPG mechanics. Instead, all of your abilities and stats are delivered through your weapon. Think of your weapon like a character class or job in a more traditional action RPG – each one dictates your role on the battlefield and how you approach each and every hunt. Playing World will teach you how these weapons can be leveled up using parts collected from slain monsters, and how to build toward the higher-level weapons on your weapon tree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, World teaches you early on that you can't just mash your attack button through most situations. The positioning of your character and angle of your attacks are the key to victory, rather than raw damage output. Knowledge of where on a monster’s body your weapon can have the most impact is half the battle. The Longsword is great for slicing off monsters' tails or long appendages, for instance, while the hammer is great for knocking enemies over by bonking them on the head hard enough. Knowing how best to utilize a specific weapon can turn the tide of any battle and set you up for success, so it's certainly worth hopping into Monster Hunter: World and getting familiar with where you can deal devastating damage to your enemies. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Having a solid understanding of the tempo of each hunt will be a huge advantage going into Wilds. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Your weapon is only one piece of World’s equation though. The Slinger is a tool attached to your hunter's left arm that allows you to use special gadgets and ammunition in a fight. Learning when to shoot a Flash Pod to blind an enemy monster or toss out some poison knives for chip damage can make or break a fight. The Slinger returns in Wilds, and knowing how to pepper in shots throughout a fight will take your game to the next level. You'll need to craft Slinger ammo from ingredients gathered from the environment, so having some familiarity with World’s crafting menus and recipes will go a long way when you start using Wilds’ own versions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you've got to grips with World’s weapons and tools you'll begin to peel back the Monster Hunter series’ other recurring layers. Your general gameplay loop begins with following monster tracks, hoping to uncover the whereabouts of the beast in question. Along the way you'll use your pickaxe to mine ore, gather some honey for potion crafting, and grab whatever other materials you find along the way to the monster's location. It all becomes second-nature after a while, and having a solid understanding of the tempo of each hunt will be a huge advantage going into Wilds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A hunt is not about rushing in, getting a quick kill, and moving on. Each expedition is designed to take some time, especially on the first go around. Learning how to dance with the fire-breathing Anjanath is leagues away from understanding the best equipment to prepare against something like the bomb-dropping Bazelgeuse, but understanding all of the different facets of these creatures builds foundational knowledge. And with Monster Hunter Wilds looking to capture the scope and scale of these adventures in a similar way to how World revels in the spectacle, it means the 2018 entry is the ideal training ground. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, if you need yet another reason to check out Monster Hunter World ahead of Wilds’ release, you can get some free Palico armor if you import save data from World into Wilds, and an additional set of armor if you have data from World’s massive Iceborne expansion. It's a small thing, but dressing up your Palico never gets old. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you never need to play a prior Monster Hunter game before starting a new one, Capcom’s RPG is a distinctly different animal than any other game out there. While the developer has been working hard to make the learning curve easier with each new game, there are so many unique systems that really the only way to truly prepare for Monster Hunter is by playing Monster Hunter. While there will be many who will find joy jumping right into the new game blind, there's never been a better time to try out Monster Hunter: World and familiarize yourself with the vernacular and community ahead of Wilds’ launch on February 28, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse Vitelli is a freelance writer and published author.
