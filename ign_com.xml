            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Go's new level cap requirements have leaked, and some fans say the fresh XP total required, as well as the some of the extra tasks involved, are too easy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> will raise its current level 50 cap for the first time in five years, and allow players to reach level 80 for the first time. But this change will come alongside an overall rebalancing of XP — meaning many players will find themselves transported to a much higher level, and potentially far beyond the XP needed to instantly hit level 80.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, players won't simply log on and find themselves at the finish line. As is the case currently, a fresh set of additional tasks will need to be completed to progress through the game's final tier of levels (from 70 to 80, replacing similar tasks required to move from 40 to 50). But even these — which have been datamined by fans — have been dubbed as rather straightforward.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last night, a <a href="https://pokemongo.com/post/pgo-leveling-update-details-2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on the official Pokémon Go blog listed out the new XP requirements needed after the game's level cap increases tomorrow, October 15.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon Go rebalanced XP requirements:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Level 10: 48,000 total XP</li><li>Level 20: 258,000 total XP</li><li>Level 30: 1,083,000 total XP</li><li>Level 40: 3,953,000 total XP</li><li>Level 50: 12,753,000 total XP</li><li>Level 60: 34,353,000 total XP</li><li>Level 70: 85,853,000 total XP</li><li>Level 80: 203,353,000 total XP</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">It's interesting to compare these fresh totals with the amounts of XP needed to hit the game's level 50 cap now. Currently, hitting level 50 requires a lifetime total of 176 million XP. (This week, following the game's rebalance, level 50 will require just 12.75 million XP.) This means the new level 80 cap requires just 27 million more XP than the current level 50. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's been clear for a while that Pokémon Go's new level cap will come alongside an overall smoothing of the game's overall XP requirements, hardcore fans have still been surprised to discover that many of them will once again be in Pokémon Go's new endgame, with little to no actual XP grinding required.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to those level up tasks, fans examining a <a href="https://x.com/thepokemodgroup/status/1977819506060759314" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">datamined list</a> of what will be needed have judged the requirements as rather straightforward. Each level requires players hold an increasing number of platinum in-game medals, though these can be earned in a way that reflects your playstyle. Some will take time — Purifying 100 Shadow Pokémon — but with planning there's nothing here which should hold up hardcore players for too long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, there is also palpable relief among fans at the lack of any artificial timegating here — such as requiring a Pokémon be caught on 30 days, holding progress back a month — something which has been found in other challenges previously. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon Go Level 71-80 level up tasks</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Level 71</strong><br>Earn 15 platinum medals<br>Power up Legendary or Mythical Pokémon 20 times<br>Make 999 Nice Throws<br>Catch 100 Pokémon in a single day

</li><li><strong>Level 76</strong><br>Earn 38 platinum medals<br>Defeat 100 Team GO Rocket Grunts<br>Explore 300 km<br>Catch 200 Pokémon in a single day
</li><li><strong>Level 77</strong><br>Earn 41 platinum medals<br>Win 100 Max Battles<br>Power up 7 Pokémon to their max CP<br>Make 10 trades with Pokémon caught at least 300 km apart

</li><li><strong>Level 79</strong><br>Earn 47 platinum medals<br>Defeat a Team GO Rocket Leader 30 times<br>Obtain 50 Lucky Pokémon in trades<br>Hatch 100 Eggs
</li><li><strong>Level 80</strong><br>Earn 50 platinum medals<br>Win 80 Trainer Battles in the GO Battle League<br>Make 999 Excellent Throws<br>Win 80 Raids</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">With these tasks, and with Pokémon Go's new XP rebalance, it feels clear that the game is adjusting itself for newer players, and leveling the playing field somewhat so there's a chance for newcomers to  catch up with those who have been playing for almost a decade. As the game approaches its 10-year anniversary next year, its developers will likely want to ensure Pokémon Go continues to welcome fresh blood to its userbase, without giving them too steep an XP mountain to climb. But some veterans are less impressed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These are all so easy," wrote Old_Indication_4379 on top Pokémon Go fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1o5tu5q/level_up_requirements_datamined/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> TheSilphRoad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm disappointed beyond disappointment," added another fan, avaible17. "I'm sitting at 352M xp and I doubt that it is very impressive number for most of the old players. I hoped for a challenge and motivation to play, I've got easy and repetitive tasks, that most of them can be done in a day (except walking ofc).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was hoping for introduction of new type of medals, that would make my grind beyond capabilities of human flesh," they continued. "Now I'm writing this and thinking, that they just make it easier for beginners, not more challenging for old dogs."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/unnamed-1-1760437722216.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go's new Daily Adventure Egg and Incubator.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh incentives to climbing levels will include permanent boosts to Pokémon, inventory and gift storage, and an improved chance at gaining Lucky Friends status when players are level 70 and above. Finally, and most mysteriously, there's a new 1km Daily Adventure Incubator for players over level 15. Alongside the game's current Daily Adventure Incense item, which rewards players with extra spawns for 15 minutes, this is designed to reward players who walk at least 1km per day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly which Pokémon the Daily Adventure Incubator will hatch, however, remains unknown — though fans are already speculating that the mechanic will eventually include an ultra-rare Pokémon (Manaphy and Phione seem a good bet!) similar to how the Daily Adventure Incense has a rare chance at spawning a Galar Legendary bird.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overnight, Pokémon Go's development team fixed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-pulls-new-weekly-challenge-feature-within-hours-after-completion-bricks-game-fuelling-concern-over-this-weeks-level-80-update">yesterday's major bug which bricked the game for anyone who completed its first Weekly Challenge</a>.

In this instance, however, the song in question is already a mega hit that has inspired a global meme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skrilla's 6 7 blew up earlier this year on TikTok and Instagram. It's a slang term referring to gun violence but became popular when it began appearing in clips about basketball players like LaMelo Ball, who is 6ft 7 inches tall. It then went viral when a boy known as the 67 Kid used it in a meme, and now kids the world over are saying it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/gettyimages-2240370184-1760434164118.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Skrilla spilled the beans on 6 7 appearing in GTA 6.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A swathe of upcoming Pokémon game projects have seemingly been detailed online, via the latest release of material originating from the so-called "Teraleak" of data hacked from the servers of series developer Game Freak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cache of information, which includes development plans, concept art and early screenshots, was revealed overnight following the disclosure yesterday of data obtained in the hack that pertained to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, which launches this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-year-on-from-the-teraleak-hackers-release-pokmon-legends-z-a-files-including-gameplay-videos-showing-cut-content-and-early-builds">IGN reported yesterday</a>, the suggestion is that the hacker behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-developer-game-freak-reportedly-hacked-stolen-data-on-unannounced-games-as-well-as-nintendo-switch-2-codename-leaked-online">last year's Game Freak breach</a> has sat on this latest cache of data for almost a year, until Pokémon Legends: Z-A's launch. But now, it seems, the floodgates are open for everything else obtained from Game Freak detailing the franchise's future — and its product roadmap for the rest of the decade.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The largest cache of information relates to the franchise's highly-anticipated "Gen 10" games that are expected to launch next year, in time for Pokémon's 30th anniversary. Details now being shared online include the titles' planned name, early animation tests, in-engine footage and word of several planned gameplay ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond this, there's information relating to a separate, ambitious-sounding Pokémon MMO project, as well as concept art for a third Pokémon Legends spin-off title. And beyond that, there's the suggestion that Pokémon's Gen 11 will follow at the start of the next decade. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a frankly astonishing leak of information, seemingly from the same source which yesterday revealed details derived from beta builds of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and last year leaked a vast treasure trove of development data on pretty much every previous Pokémon project launched to date.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon fans are already poring over the purported plans and discussing several eye-opening gameplay mechanics. There's even early fan art for a new Pokémon species spotted in one of the new pieces of conceprt art. But it's worth pointing out that some or indeed much of what has been shared may not ultimately come to pass. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As yesterday's Pokémon Legends: Z-A beta build leak showed, gameplay features get cut in development. And nothing in the Teraleak can be relied upon as reflecting Game Freak's current plans — as the hack itself took place back in August 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo previously attempted to track down the culprit behind the Teraleak, and launched a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-requests-subpoena-of-discord-to-track-down-user-behind-last-years-pokemon-teraleak">legal bid to subpoena Discord</a> to divulge the hackers' identity back in April this year.
