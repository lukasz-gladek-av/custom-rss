"The amount of creativity that is packed into the different quests and the various characters is nothing short of amazing and it all combines to form a mega fun adventure," we said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/22/sly-3-honor-among-thieves">Finally, Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves is a touch lower but still well praised at 8/10</a>. "It's still a fun ride and many of the new additions work out well, especially the pirate sections, but there are enough rocky spots to make the game feel kind of awkward and hold it back from being truly great," we said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
