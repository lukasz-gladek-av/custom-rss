Let's run it back." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The message was appended with two hashtags: "CBB" — an acronym for college basketball — and EA Sports' customary "It's in the Game." Oh, and there was an image of a basketball, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're unfamiliar with basketball and EA Sports' relationship with it, it's worth noting that this is <em>big</em> news, as it marks the first time EA Sports has taken us into the heart of college basketball since 2009's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ncaa-basketball-10"><u>NCAA Basketball 10</u></a>.

"But at the same time, there was also a loneliness in thinking, 'I won’t be able to work with these people anymore…' That said, with only a few years left until retirement anyway, and since game development often takes many years, I felt a stronger desire to move forward at my own pace, doing more freely creative things."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While reading that may come as a surprise, it seems that sentiment is shared by many former Nintendo employees.
