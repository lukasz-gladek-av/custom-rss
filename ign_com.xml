That's a chunky 25% of the Switch 2’s internal storage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo also recently confirmed that several new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-game-cards-will-only-include-a-download-key"><u>Switch 2 game cards won’t always carry an actual game</u></a>, but instead contain a key for a game download. This isn't the case for Cyberpunk 2077, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, one of the biggest games on the original Switch, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, was just 16 GB.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that the GameCube app’s size is expected to grow as new games are added to the library. At launch, the GameCube app contains The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and SoulCalibur 2.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, how is the Nintendo Switch 2 able to get away with relatively small game sizes while offering up to 4K resolution?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In January, the internet spotted a Nintendo patent, filed July 2023 but published for the first time earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-ramp-up-as-new-patent-suggests-ai-image-upscaling-tech"><u>that described AI image upscaling technology</u></a> that would help keep video game download sizes small enough to fit on a physical game cartridge while offering up to 4K textures. It was thought at the time that this applied to the Nintendo Switch 2, and could relate to Nvidia DLSS graphics technology.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is an AI-powered technology that uses machine learning to upscale lower-resolution images in real-time, enhancing both performance and image quality in games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, in the wake of the Nintendo Direct, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-says-its-custom-gpu-means-nintendo-switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch">Nintendo and Nvidia confirmed the Switch 2’s custom GPU enables AI upscaling via DLSS and ray tracing</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nvidia described it as a “custom Nvidia processor featuring an Nvidia GPU with dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores for stunning visuals and AI-driven enhancements.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those upgrades include up to 4K gaming in TV mode and up to 120 FPS at 1080p in handheld mode. Nintendo Switch 2 also supports HDR, and AI upscaling “to sharpen visuals and smooth gameplay.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new RT Cores bring real-time ray tracing, delivering “lifelike lighting, reflections and shadows for more immersive worlds,” Nvidia continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tensor Cores, meanwhile, power AI-driven features like DLSS, “boosting resolution for sharper details without sacrificing image quality.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details are thin on the ground, however. In a hardware-focused roundtable Q&amp;A in New York this week, attended by IGN, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-uses-dlss-and-ray-tracing-but-is-being-super-vague-about-the-details"><u>Nintendo representatives confirmed the Switch 2 uses DLSS</u></a>, but did not specify which version of the tech, or whether it had been customized for Switch 2. It was a similarly vague response when Nintendo confirmed the Switch 2’s GPU is capable of ray tracing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what about the GPU itself? Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, chimed in to say Nintendo prefers not to get in the weeds on things like the GPU.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nintendo doesn't share too much on the hardware spec,” he said. “What we really like to focus on is the value that we can provide to our consumers. But I do believe that our partner Nvidia will be sharing some information.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced"><u>everything announced at the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive"><u>what the experts have to say about the Switch 2 price and Mario Kart World’s $80 price tag</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/bungies-marathon-finally-emerges-from-the-shadows-to-tease-something<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>? It’s Destiny developer Bungie’s next game, and it looks like we’re about to finally see more of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marathon is a PvP-focused extraction shooter set on the mysterious planet of Tau Ceti IV. Players inhabit the bodies of Runners, cybernetic mercenaries who have been designed to survive the planet’s harsh environments, exploring the lost colony that once inhabited Tau Ceti’s surface.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has been some time since we saw or heard of Marathon. In October, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-shooter-marathon-is-on-track-but-too-early-in-development-to-show">Bungie released a lengthy development update <u>video</u> that shed light on Marathon's mechanics</a>, but stressed how early in development the game was. Player character models were, at that point, still "coming together," while enemy models were still in an "early state."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, though, half a year later, it looks like Bungie is finally ready to reveal what it’s been working on. A tweet from the official Marathon account, below, revealed a typically cryptic image and accompanying garbled signal noise. As fans have noticed, there’s ASCII art of footage from the debut Marathon trailer. Given this is Bungie we’re talking about, a developer known for its mysterious teasers, hidden clues, and Easter eggs, there’s probably much more here to discover, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon/comments/1jr6otv/unencrypted_code/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans are already working to find out what it all means</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Either way, it very much looks like it’s finally happening for Marathon after what has been a troubled development.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/6NBgIdRVK2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6NBgIdRVK2</a></p>— Marathon (@MarathonTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907956872046690602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-reveals-new-marathon-game-at-playstation-showcase"><u>Marathon was revealed in May 2023</u></a> as a reboot of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/4-ways-marathon-influenced-modern-games"><u>the classic Bungie franchise</u></a>, but with all its themes of "mysteries, eeriness, and psychological creepiness." But Bungie itself has suffered several controversies in recent years, headlined by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio"><u>the laying off of 220 staff members</u></a>, meaning 17% of its workforce, in July 2024: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-industry-criticizes-bungie-management-ceo-pete-parsons-in-wake-of-layoffs-inexcusable"><u>a move even industry peers criticized</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This came <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pete-parsons-tells-employees-bungie-kept-the-right-people-to-work-on-destiny-2"><u>less than a year after 100 other layoffs at Bungie</u></a>, at which point <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover"><u>staff told IGN the atmosphere was "soul crushing" at the studio</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Further controversy came when a report released weeks after the 220 job losses alleging <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-director-was-fired-following-misconduct-investigation-at-bungie-report"><u>former Marathon director Chris Barrett was fired after an internal misconduct investigation</u></a> at Bungie. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bungie-director-chris-barrett-suing-sony-interactive-entertainment-and-bungie-for-more-than-200-million">Barrett subsequently sued Sony Interactive Entertainment and Bungie for more than $200 million</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This all comes as Sony rethinks its focus on live-service games. Sony president Hiroki Totoki said in November 2023 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-commits-to-launch-just-six-of-playstations-12-live-service-games-by-march-2026"><u>the company was committed to launching just six of the 12 live service games it was working on</u></a> by March 2026, in a shift in strategy that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward"><u>saw The Last of Us multiplayer game cancelled</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Arrowhead’s Helldivers 2 was a breakout hit, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, Sony’s other live service games were either canceled or suffered disastrous launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Sony’s Concord is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history, lasting just a couple of weeks before it was brought offline amid eye-wateringly low player numbers. Sony later decided to kill the game entirely and shut its developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony reportedly canceled two unannounced live service games</u></a>, one a God of War title in development at Bluepoint, the other in the works at Days Gone developer Bend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

But knowing the “why” of it doesn’t really ease the pain on the wallet. What’s more, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-isnt-the-only-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-costs-80-some-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-do-as-well"><u>we learned just this morning</u></a> that a number of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games, including The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Kirby and the Forgotten Land, will also be $80.

Are $80 games the new Nintendo normal?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As usual, rather than speculate ourselves, we went and found some expert analysts to tell us what they think is going to happen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">A New Nintendo Normal</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">NYU Stern professor and author of <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/the-joy-of-six" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SuperJoost Playlist,</u></a> Joost van Dreunen, believes Nintendo is using Mario Kart World as a “test case for premium pricing,” and will evaluate consumer response before applying this more broadly. Spoilers: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendos-switch-2-treehouse-livestream-is-just-a-flood-of-angry-comments-shouting-drop-the-price"><u>the response hasn’t been great so far</u></a>! But sentiment is not the same as sales, and Nintendo will likely measure success by how well Mario Kart World actually sells.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>“</strong>If the $80 price point succeeds, Nintendo will likely extend it selectively to their most valuable franchises rather than making it standard across their first-party lineup. Franchises that could potentially justify the premium pricing include:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Legend of Zelda - the next mainline entry following Tears of the Kingdom could command $80 given the series' prestige and the expansive scope these games typically offer.</li><li>New 3D Mario adventures - for major releases in the vein of Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo could position these as premium products.</li><li>Super Smash Bros. - the next installment of this franchise would be a strong candidate for premium pricing due to its extensive roster and competitive staying power.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">“Games that likely wouldn't justify the premium price include smaller-scale entries, remasters, and series with more niche appeal. Nintendo will probably maintain a tiered pricing strategy, with their tent-pole franchises at $80, mid-tier releases at $60-70, and smaller titles at traditional price points.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rhys Elliott, games analyst at Alinea Analytics, had a similar take, pointing to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>top 10 best-selling Nintendo Switch games</u></a> as a guide for what we might see get an $80 price tag in the future. “I could see Nintendo pricing mainline Pokémon games, mainline Zelda games, and the inevitably imminent 3D Mario and Animal Crossing games at $80 physical (but $70 digital still).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And James McWhirter, analyst at Omdia, added a suggested hypothetical Splatoon 4 to the list of possibilities, along with another thought on future monetization:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For titles that do not adopt the $80 base price, Nintendo could lean in more heavily in alternative forms of monetisation, including those it has so far refrained from using, such as tying paid early access to higher value editions of its games.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Grand Theft, Grand Price?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">That covers Nintendo, but what about other games? Earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-at-100-would-be-a-bridge-too-far-even-for-grand-theft-auto"><u>we covered a flurry of speculation on one specifically: Grand Theft Auto 6</u></a>. At the time, we were responding to rumors and discussion that Take-Two might price the sequel to the over 200 million selling blockbuster at $80, $90, or even $100. Analysts suggested that the high end of this was rather unlikely, but what about now? Will Grand Theft Auto 6 cost $80... or even more?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tiago Reis, market analyst at Newzoo, certainly thinks so. “For sure. Big hits that are highly anticipated (e.g., GTA 6, new CODs) can get away with it due to franchise recognition. Most people are not going to stop buying these games because they are $10 more expensive. If consumers are willing to wait, they can get it at a discount a couple of months after release. But by then, these companies have already extracted max value/price from the people who are less price sensitive.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reis’ colleague Lauren Universe, client services manager at Newzoo, added: “Frankly, I expect base GTA to be at least $80, with multiple options of various increased prices (like Civ 7) that include expansions, DLCs, and ‘early access.’”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, agreed, and even expanded on who might be interested in raising prices beyond just Take-Two. “I do believe there is a chance that companies like Microsoft or Sony could feel encouraged to raise their prices now. Would you be shocked if Take-Two now thought to themselves: ‘If Nintendo can charge $80 for a Mario Kart game, we can do the same for GTA 6 - a title thousands of people have been working on for 12 years?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nuno Domingues Marques, also a market analyst at Newzoo, similarly brought up Sony and Microsoft as possible candidates for price hikes. “I am unsure if Sony/Xbox will wait for their next generation to make the push or if they will adjust post-Switch launch, but certainly, it seems like the way forward. Third-party publishers will jump on it as soon as they feel it is justified, which is likely ASAP. Not all exclusive games will cost $80, in my opinion though. Games like Ratchet &amp; Clank or other smaller niche experiences are likely to keep lower price points.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Elliott pushed back a bit on the idea that Mario Kart World could have opened a higher pricing floodgate. He pointed out that at least in the UK and Europe (U.S. price discrepancies are still unconfirmed), Nintendo is charging more for the physical edition of Mario Kart World than digital in an effort to push more consumers toward the digital edition. But he suspects that because the other two console platforms are far more digitally-oriented than Nintendo (something he discussed in more detail in our other piece on the Switch 2 pricing), this would be a tougher sell for other publishers.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While I believe Take Two could charge over $70 for GTA 6, I maintain that it is a bad idea.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“While I believe Take Two could charge over $70 for GTA 6, I maintain that it is a bad idea for three reasons. [One,] the real cash cow is GTA Online and its recurring revenues, so limiting the total addressable audience at launch wouldn't be smart. There’s also a cost-of-living crisis happening globally and GTA appeals to everyone – rich and less fortunate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[Two,] Rockstar needs to move players from GTA 5, and a higher floor for the switching cost would limit the GTA 5-to-GTA 6 player acquisition. Players not budging from GTA 5 is probably one of GTA 6's biggest threats, one GTA hasn't really faced before. After all, live services are mostly zero-sum in today's oversaturated attention economy. GTA 6 isn't just competing against competitors' games, it's competing with TikTok, Netflix, and even its predecessor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[Three,] Rockstar can easily charge $100 or more for an edition of GTA 6 with a week of early access, maybe with a shark card thrown in. Players with disposable income will pay for it. This is the best of both worlds for Take-Two. This is pretty much the norm for AAA games these days.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elliott concluded that even with all that in mind, GTA 6 nonetheless stands a better chance than any other game at withstanding a price hike with its consumer base intact. So ultimately, the question of GTA 6’s pricing remains an impossible one to answer up to the point where Take-Two finally announces it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Living in Interesting Times</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll end on a hopeful note, though, which I got from both Mat Piscatella, analyst at Circana, and a couple of analysts at Newzoo. These folks told me that while we’re likely to keep seeing games get more expensive (and, as Piscatella points out, have already been for a while via Collector’s Editions and similar), we may also see them get cheaper in certain ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Other Nintendo games will certainly follow suit,” said Brett Hunt, market analyst at Newzoo. “It could, however, open the door for Nintendo to have an adjusted discounting strategy for the Switch 2.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marques agreed. “Maybe we will see a bigger window of pricing as well, as seen from the Donkey Kong game. Creation of space for multiple different-sized games; games that cost $49.99, $59.99, etc., having distinct content depth and breadth expectations. I agree that maybe a new discounting strategy is coming from Nintendo.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And as Piscatella put it, Nintendo may not be the only company that sees the need to break with $70 convention in more than just one way. “We certainly could see other publishers try and establish even higher base prices for some of their new games. But we could also see more significant price promotion and discounting as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With all of the uncertainty in the market, we're at a point where both publishers and consumers will have to figure out where things go next. These are, after all, interesting times."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social.
