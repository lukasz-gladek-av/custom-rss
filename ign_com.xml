            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Chinese Room, the acclaimed British indie studio behind last year's oil rig horror game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a>, has now officially cut ties with its former parent company Sumo Digital. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio, which also developed indie darlings Dear Esther and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, has now completed a management buyout, a spokesperson for The Chinese Room has confirmed to IGN. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's news follows an uncertain few months for the Brighton-based studio, after Sumo's previous <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2025/sumo-group-update/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announcement</a> it would be refocusing its efforts "exclusively on development services for partners", rather than continuing its work on original franchises.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a message to press today, The Chinese Room said it had looked "increasingly likely" the company would be sold off by Sumo Digital, likely to a private equity firm or another overseas buyer — Sumo itself having been acquired by Chinese giant Tencent in 2018.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, The Chinese Room will now be run as an indepedent entity headed up by studio director Ed Daly, following a deal facilitated by venture capital firm Hiro Capital. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property, but also to partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with our vision," Daly said. "This is what we are doing and we want to carry on doing it, so we're happy to carry on in this vein."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the launch of Still Wakes the Deep and last month's DLC pack Siren's Rest, The Chinese Room now has two new IPs in the works, it was revealed today. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next to launch, however, will be the long-gestating Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, set to be published by Paradox Interactive this coming October.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Chinese Room is a huge British success story that has rightly been recognised as a unique creative force capable of competing on the world stage," said Spike Laurie, a partner at Hiro Capital.  "From hiring British people to making games set in the UK, they've been one of our foremost creative studios and now they are once again in charge of their own destiny while remaining British.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are at risk of overlooking these creative gems and letting them be sold to overseas corporations," Laurie continued. "That is a travesty for the $5.5 billion British gaming industry which has a world-renowned reputation. We need to nurture this talent and support it through difficult times, because it is one of our leading creative exports."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

It's been decades since Donkey Kong's last 3D outing, and this might just be DK's best game yet. There are hundreds of different bananas to find across each layer of the planet, and the new Bananza mechanics are a joy to experiment with. In my opinion, Bananza is worthy of picking up a Nintendo Switch 2 — it's that good.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Persona 3 Reload for $20</h2></div><div catalogid="32d78f5f-cb50-4f43-84a1-aaecdcc68343" id="225512"><div id="225512" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Persona 3 Reload (PS5)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona 3 Reload is available at Walmart for just $20. This was one of the most anticipated RPGs of 2024, and for the most part, it delivered. The mystery of the Dark Hour is compelling, and Persona 3's cast of characters shine bright in a story that has quite a few twists and turns. The Episode Aigis DLC features epilogue content that was originally depicted in The Answer, so you can experience everything Persona 3 has to offer with Reload.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition for $47.99</h2></div><div catalogid="32d78f5f-cb50-4f43-84a1-aaecdcc68343" id="225506"><div id="225506" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition launched earlier this year, and it's still one of the biggest RPGs you can jump into on any platform. The remaster introduced numerous quality-of-life updates that were much needed, in addition to a brand-new epilogue chapter. We gave the game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review">a 9/10 in our review</a>, stating, "Xenoblade Chronicles X was already one of the Wii U’s best games, and this Definitive Edition does more than enough to justify another trip to planet Mira."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Donkey Kong Switch Games Are on Sale at Woot</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> out now, there has never been a better time to jump in and experience the Nintendo Switch library of Donkey Kong games.

If you haven't had the chance to check this one out yet, Amazon has Nintendo Switch copies available for only $34.99. In my opinion, the Switch has to be the definitive way to experience this classic, and now is the perfect time to catch up before Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake this Fall.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Apple AirPods 4 for $89.99</h2></div><div catalogid="32d78f5f-cb50-4f43-84a1-aaecdcc68343" id="225514"><div id="225514" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods 4 Wireless Earbuds</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Apple AirPods 4 are 30% off at Amazon right now, making this weekend a great time to pick up a pair if you've been meaning to.

The H2 chip packs in better sound and call quality than the AirPods 3, so you can expect a great listening experience at all times.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Request A Nintendo Switch 2 Invitation on Amazon</h2></div><div id="224535" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="43f764a1-8692-437c-8614-00fd94472924"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Amazon has already begun sending out invites to buy.</p></div></div><div catalogid="43f764a1-8692-437c-8614-00fd94472924" id="224536"><div id="224536" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Amazon has already begun sending out invites to buy.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has at last listed the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and you can request an invite to purchase the console now. Once you are selected, you will receive an email that will allow you to add the system to your cart and purchase it. There is no telling when these invites will run out, so I recommend requesting one, even if you might purchase the Switch 2 elsewhere.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bose Ultra Open-Ear Wireless Earbuds for $199</h2></div><div catalogid="32d78f5f-cb50-4f43-84a1-aaecdcc68343" id="225508"><div id="225508" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bose - Ultra Open-Ear True Wireless Open Earbuds - White Smoke</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Best Buy has the Bose Ultra Open Ear Wireless Earbuds for $199 this weekend.

It was yet another jam-packed showing for the Digital Extremes team as it careens toward the launch of more story expansions for Warframe and the eventual launch of Soulframe.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/19/wf-the-old-peace-keyart-3840x2160-1752945235720.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Digital Extremes celebrates TennoCon 2025 with gameplay demos for Soulframe and Warframe. Image courtesy of Digital Extremes.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From Warframe’s new The Old Peace Narrative Chapter and the devil-frame Uriel to Soulframe’s fresh gameplay updates, we’ve gathered all of the highlights from today’s TennoCon 2025 livestream presentation for you to check out right here. Plus, whether you’re seeing everything for the first time or just looking for a refresher, we’ve also included information Digital Extremes shared with press during a TennoCon preview event IGN attended earlier this month.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Soulframe</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Soulframe is still very much in development, but that didn’t stop Digital Extremes from providing attendees with a new gameplay deep dive. Just like TennoCon 2024, this year’s Soulframe presentation gives fans a live look at the team’s progress, highlighting all of the improvements, big and small.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Extensive customization options are one element Digital Extremes plans to carry from Warframe to Soulframe, with the team doubling down on that idea during TennoCon today. Additionally, while Soulframe Preludes, a private early access build that is open for all this weekend, has largely seen players focus on up-close, methodical combat with swords and shields, the team has been experimenting with other options, including sidearms. More love for fans of two-handed weapons is also something Digital Extremes says is “absolutely” in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You’ll see that, now, the game now supports casting playstyles and archery playstyles,” Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair said during the preview event. “So, there’s a lot of choice now in the game, not just that up-close, sweaty, parry stuff… and because you now have a sidearm, you can mix and match those if you want as well.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Soulframe Gameplay Demo Screenshots - TennoCon 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The TennoCon 2025 Soulframe gameplay showcase kicked off with a conversation with quest-giver and customization NPC Verminia. After trailing her winged rat friend, fans were able to catch a glimpse an Envoy ability that allows players to transform into a blue butterfly, opening up a window to become closer with nature in the land of Alca while also sneaking up on unsuspecting enemies. As the demo continued, audiences were able to catch glimpse of the Neath'uns underground as well as a fight against a three-headed, corrupted foe known as The Waste Bear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The player featured in today’s build can also be seen casting green magic at their enemies from a distance. The Soulframe team says the combat shown in the TennoCon demo is “more casual” than what’s been offered so far, as players will have the freedom to hurl energy at their foes by using a staff and potentially other tools, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Over a year now of players going hands-on with <em>Soulframe </em>in our <em>Preludes </em>pre-alpha builds, we’ve learned so many lessons and built a lot of new features for us as a studio,” Soulframe Creative Director Geoff Crookes said in a statement. “After last TennoCon, we put a huge amount of effort into improving combat fluidity and continued that passionate work into exploring brand new features like player social hubs, asynchronous player messaging with World Trees, among so many other additions. Today, we shared what the latest additions to our next Preludes build would be and beyond. We promise to all existing and future players to keep trying new things outside our comfort zone and work with you to create something we’ve all been looking for.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see how things are shaping up, along with a first look at combat against the Bromius Omen Beast and the Wazzard of Wastes, in the TennoCon 2025 Soulframe gameplay trailer below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During a press Q&amp;A session, Digital Extremes shared more about what players can expect to see come to Soulframe in the future. For those hoping to see some version of an extended open Preludes period, the team says it needs more time before committing to any plans, but it at least sounds like the idea isn’t off the table should development progress smoothly.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Warframe: The Old Peace</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/warframe-official-bring-an-end-to-this-tennocon-2025-teaser-trailer"><u>a week of teasers</u></a> and excitement from the community, Digital Extremes has revealed that the next major Warframe narrative chapter is an Operator-focused story titled The Old Peace. Centered around a peaceful time in the past, this new chapter is expected to launch later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay footage for The Old Peace reveals a remastered look for players’ Tenno Operators as they bounce between the present and the past. It's a lot to take in, with one lengthy segment revealing a mission that features a crucial bit of fan service: a playable version of Excalibur Prime. This specific Warframe, previously made available only to early Warframe adopters, won’t become available ever again, but The Old Peace will at least allow players to finally step into his shoes for a few cinematic, story-driven sequences.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warframe The Old Peace Screenshots - TennoCon 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Digital Extremes released a brief teaser for the content alongside its demo debut: “Think far back and remember the long-forgotten tale of Tau, a childhood Sentient friend named Adis, as well as the war-scarring conflict between the Orokin, their creations, and a coalition of <a href="https://tarabrunopr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2fqDDzFIpOQvzaHe1zS1Al4x1gM9X5tnPIaUhcAI2kAPxRQYamAEiJN0IMGVps944fTzTitm4Uw5H4PxbZ6zLTIFHPwp2Ao-P10EEFz_39sDtsFup8T1lmId6CZABkMeMirrj_9f9cQI6VmIG7LbJ8Z2vif9VLXVqlb7JlFZJ6H-Sb8ERxdMep1BRoH0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Dax Anarch Warriors</u></a> upon the Perita moon.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Old Peace will also feature a side story known as The Devil’s Triad. How exactly its contents fit into Warframe lore remains somewhat of a mystery, but we do know that it will introduce two new Protoframes into the mix. Despite fears that Digital Extremes would refrain from releasing more of these human-infused Warframe styles, fans can rest easy knowing that the story content features Protoframes for both Harrow and Wisp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Devil’s Triad will also serve as a welcome mat for Uriel, the next new Warframe. This Frame is said to be inspired by the devil, featuring glowing red highlights that cover his tar-like design. Details about Uriel’s abilities have yet to be revealed.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/wf-tc25-devilstriad-cinematickeyimage-3840x2160-1752849509221.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">(Left to right) Protoframe Harrow, Uriel, and Protoframe Wisp pose for The Devil's Triad. Image courtesy of Digital Extremes.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside some of The Old Peace’s most notable additions comes the promise of a mysterious new faction and a Tauros Focus expansion, which comes with a new Operator ultimate ability. Digital Extremes is also maintaining its commitment to providing Warframe fans with a solid listening experience by publishing its new song, Lullaby of the Manifold, for free on YouTube. The track was featured in today’s The Old Peace gameplay demo and will become available on most music platforms starting July 21, 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Digital Extremes Has More Warframe Content in the Works</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Old Peace is no doubt the biggest card Digital Extremes has up its sleeve for 2025, but there is so much more in store, too. The swift and sharp Valkyr will receive her Heirloom cosmetic bundle July 21, giving longtime fans of the clawed warrior <a href="https://x.com/perttibahaaN/status/1921320024427360509" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a collection created in collaboration with community artist Pertti Bahaa</u></a>. The Warframe team is also partnering with tabletop RPG developer Paizo to create Warframe x Starfinder: Operation Orias, which is set to arrive for tabletop fans this October.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also set to arrive at an unspecified point this fall is what Digital Extremes is calling its “Untitled Fall Update.” It’s set to be one of the most substantial additions to Warframe ever, promising content that includes a ground-up rework for the nature-themed Oberon, a Lavos deluxe skin, and the 62nd Warframe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new content, along with a host of quality-of-life features, sounds promising, but the real reason to get excited is a new tutorial Quest called The Teacher. The mission will finally introduce a streamlined introduction to how Warframe’s Mod system works as Digital Extremes works to address criticisms regarding its game’s steep learning curve for new players.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Future Warframe Updates Incoming Screenshots - TennoCon 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More about the Untitled Fall Update will be revealed during the September Devstream. In the meantime, players can also look forward to a Warframe Android closed beta in the fall (<a href="https://www.warframe.com/android" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>sign up here</u></a>), as well as Caliban Prime access. The latter was briefly featured during today’s The Old Peace gameplay showcase and is set to be released before the new Narrative Chapter launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for a proper Nintendo Switch 2 Warframe port, Sinclair shared during the Q&amp;A session that the Digital Extremes tech team is “so excited” to utilize the power of Nintendo’s sequel hybrid console, teasing potential upgrades like faster load times. There’s just one problem: they need dev kits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our tech team is so excited to take advantage of the high-speed cores and the other really cool features of it,” Sinclair said. “There’s just such a backlog for dev kits. So, yeah, if you know anyone… just one, that’s all it would take. I know our programmers are just, like, ‘Oh, I can’t wait.’ We definitely have plans. When we get a dev kit, we will be doing a custom build for Warframe. Absolutely.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/wf-tau-2026-announcement-3840x2160-logo-1752849744958.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Tau Narrative Chapter coming to Warframe in 2026. Image courtesy of Digital Extremes.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Warframe content for 2025 is locked in, with much of it shown off during all of the TennoCon 2025 festivities. For 2026, meanwhile, Digital Extremes is teasing a full-on Tau Narrative Chapter. Information on how it will pick up from where The Old Peace leaves off remains tightly under wraps for now, with no release date or window given, outside of the promise that it will launch next year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10 Years of TennoCon in the Books</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Soulframe looks like another ambitious online experience from Digital Extremes, but TennoCon would be nothing without the game that started it all. Warframe Creative Director Rebecca Ford touched on the journey so far when speaking about the 10-year TennoCon anniversary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"10 years of TennoCon is such a mind-boggling thing to say out loud,” Ford said. “When we first started this celebration event back in 2016, we had no idea it would grow to what it is today. Our community is everything to us; we wouldn’t be here without them. To be able to continue TennoCon and bring together more players in person from around the world and treat them to the latest announcements, hijinks, and simply celebrate the world of Warframe is a privilege we don’t take for granted.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">She continued: “The 10th TennoCon has been a deeply special, unforgettable journey. We want to thank our community to Tau and back for joining us on this monumental milestone. See you all next year!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on TennoCon, you can read <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/digital-extremes-answers-all-of-our-soulframe-questions-including-warframe-tie-ins-and-more"><u>our interview with the Soulframe team from TennoCon 2024</u></a>, where we learned more about how the fantasy RPG came to life and what its future holds.
