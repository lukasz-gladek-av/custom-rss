            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite"><u>Fortnite</u></a> appears to be getting The Office content in Chapter 7 after rumors suggested Epic Games was working on a crossover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of TV and video games were thrown for a loop earlier today when Epic shared a <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/2013733381436236001?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not-so-cryptic tease</a> on social media. It’s the kind of thing that would seem completely nonsensical to the uninitiated, but those who are even peripherally aware of the NBC comedy will recognize “Build. Beets. Battle Royale.” as a reference to one of the most memorable quotes from The Office.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Build. Beets. Battle Royale. <a href="https://t.co/erCDcS0ZSS" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/erCDcS0ZSS</a></p>— Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/2013733381436236001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 20, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">A meeting between Fortnite and The Office, though never considered to be impossible, is unexpected, but some recent rumors had players believing confirmation was only a matter of time. Popular Fortnite content creator Shiina said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzUlbmE9wFE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>they heard The Office could soon show up</u></a> just last week. At the time, they suggested a rumor about “<a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/2011479573670596794?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a nostalgic duo from a live-action TV series</u></a>” was tied to the show but neglected to share more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which members of the Dunder Mifflin crew could be recreated in Epic’s battle royale mega-hit remains a mystery, but references to names like Michael Scott, Dwight Schrute, Jim Halpert, and Pam Beesly seem the most likely. It’s also unclear when exactly we’ll learn more about the potential Fortnite crossover, but some fans are already taking the tease as an opportunity to share their excitement.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/4bPhs7pSXy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/4bPhs7pSXy</a></p>— Jorge_Most (@Jorge_Most) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jorge_Most/status/2013733775599940005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 20, 2026</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/b8LFozezOn" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/b8LFozezOn</a></p>— FNAssist (@FN_Assist) <a href="https://twitter.com/FN_Assist/status/2013734371316879743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 20, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Shiina, meanwhile, has already posted an update since the Fortnite The Office tease reared its head. Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvGl6kixgSE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new video</a> comes with the suggestion that the classic workplace comedy is coming soon, with content for Regular Show and Ed, Edd n Eddy also in the works at Epic. Players may want to take all of today’s information with a grain of salt, but with Fortnite’s track record for wild crossovers in mind, it wouldn’t be much of a surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-zero-hour-live-event-draws-105-million-players-as-godzilla-king-kong-iron-man-and-kpop-demon-hunters-unite-for-avengers-endgame-style-finale"><u>launched into Chapter 7</u></a> in November with an Avenger-style team-up event. Crossovers added since then include skins for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/fortnite-official-kim-kardashian-gameplay-trailer"><u>Kim Kardashian</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/fortnite-official-bleach-collaboration-trailer"><u>Bleach</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-meets-south-park-as-official-trailer-reveals-5-player-quints-playlist-and-a-free-mini-pass"><u>South Park</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Anime is awesome. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">Board games</a> are also awesome. Put the two together, and you get tabletop fun that not only shows off some of the hottest anime series out there, but can also capture the wild nature of the animated media and their associated tropes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are plenty of games that have animed-themed versions like Naruto Monopoly or Dragonball Z Yahtzee, this list instead focuses on games that use the IPs they feature as a theme rather than simply being an anime reskin, and games that do a great job in replicating the look, feel, or tropes of this beloved art form. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just as a side note before we get into the list itself, this will only feature board games and won’t go into the plethora of solid anime TCGs that exist, like Digimon and One Piece, or TTRPGs either. Those are out there, and I recommend seeking those out, too, if that is more your style.</p><p id="react-the-arts-of-war"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Re;ACT - The Arts of War">Re;ACT - The Arts of War</h2></p><div id="234233"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234233" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Re;ACT - The Arts of War</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast-paced matches with hot-looking anime characters, each with dynamic and unique mechanics? Sign me up! Re;Act from Brother Ming Games puts players in the roles of artists who've been granted powers based on their respective art forms and are pitted against one another in a 1v1 showdown. Described as “Yugioh meets chess” by the creator Ming Yang Lu, where the importance of positioning from chess crosses over with the interrupts and actions of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yu-gi-oh-tcg">Yugioh</a>, where you will declare your intentions by playing a card before allowing the opponent to play a reaction, acting akin to a trap card. From super-powered  Calligraphers to Dancers, Animators, and Painters, Re;Act: The Arts of War is shonen anime in a box and a blast to play.</p></div><p id="millennium-blades"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Millennium Blades">Millennium Blades</h2></p><div id="234398"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234398" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Millennium Blades</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Crack packs, build decks, and outfit yourself with the coolest deckbox out there in Millennium Blades – a board game about competing in a card game. Players are pro TCG players who are all vying to win the most points by doing well in the game’s three tournaments. Outside of the actual tournaments, which see you playing cards to score points, there are real-time trading and buying phases where you will trade cards with other players or the store, and buy packs of cards using Monopoly-esque money. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like the real world, the meta of the game will change as the game progresses and force you to adjust your approach and swap out cards. There are so many clever nods and homages to other games and anime that give Millennium Blades a wonderful identity, but don’t let its silliness fool you – it's a tense and highly strategic game with plenty of content, so you'll never play the same game twice. </p></div><p id="power-rangers-heroes-of-the-grid"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Power Rangers: Heroes of the Grid">Power Rangers: Heroes of the Grid</h2></p><div id="234399"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234399" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Power Rangers: Heroes of the Grid</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This may be splitting hairs a bit since TECHNICALLY,  Power Rangers, aka Super Sentai, isn’t anime, but their motif and idea can be found in plenty of anime, and Super Sentai and its sibling Kamen Rider are just as much a part of Japan's entertainment history as anime, and so Power Rangers: Heroes of the Grid is on this list. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Heroes of the Grid is a cooperative boss battler in which the Ranger players attempt to take out the chosen monster of the week and big bad like Rita Repulsa before their forces overwhelm Angel Grove. Each Ranger has a unique deck and the respective zords they play with to get the job done, and with the plethora of expansions this game has, you can use your favorite ranger teams and villains. Heroes of the Grid is a great <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">co-op board game</a> with teamwork and strategy being front and center. It's sure to delight Power Ranger fans.</p></div><p id="guilty-gear-strive-the-board-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Guilty Gear -Strive- The Board Game">Guilty Gear -Strive- The Board Game</h2></p><div id="234400"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234400" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Guilty Gear -Strive- The Board Game</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most stylish anime fighting games of the modern video game generation is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/guilty-gear">Guilty Gear series</a> by Arc System Works. The same anime flair carries over into the board game adaptation, Guilty Gear Strive: The Board Game, which was released last year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This 1v1 dueling game features 20 characters from Strive, each with their own decks to play that highlight the styles and moves from the video game counterpart. It uses the Exceed card game system, so positioning of your character is crucial in Strive with attacks requiring different spacing to pull off and rewards keeping the momentum and pressure on. Set-up is fast and matches are over quickly, making this a great <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">quick board game</a> to act as a filler between bigger ones or playing a bunch of rounds. Like we said in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/guilty-gear-strive-the-board-game-review"><u>review</u></a>, this game captures not only the look of the source material but also what we love about fighting games. Fans of Guilty Gear or of fast-paced card games will find something to like with Guilty Gear Strive: The Board Game.</p></div><p id="one-piece-luffys-bento-panic"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="One Piece: Luffy’s Bento Panic">One Piece: Luffy’s Bento Panic</h2></p><div id="234401"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234401" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>One Piece: Luffy’s Bento Panic</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Perfect for anime conventions or parties with friends, One Piece: Luffy’s Bento Panic is a silly party game based on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-piece-series-movies-in-order">the hit anime</a> featuring Luffy, Nami, Zoro, Sanji, and the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates. In Bento Panic, players take on the role of their favorite Straw Hat and celebrate a recent victory in the best way they know how – with a feast! Sitting in a circle, using their hands, all at once, players show a different gesture to declare their action from their turn, either pulling food tokens from the blind bag, stealing food from a neighbor, blocking a steal, or eating food. Points are scored by eating sets of food tokens, with the game only ending when Luffy wakes from his food coma a third time. Luffy’s Bento Panic makes a great <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults">party board game</a>, since everyone takes their turn at once. And like we mentioned in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-piece-luffys-bento-panic-board-game-review"><u>review</u></a>, even folks who aren’t necessarily fans of One Piece will have a good time with this one.</p></div><p id="aegis-combining-robots-second-ignit"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="AEGIS Combining Robots: Second Ignit">AEGIS Combining Robots: Second Ignition</h2></p><div id="234402"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234402" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>AEGIS Combining Robots: Second Ignition</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For nearly as long as anime has existed, super robots and combining robots have been a part of it. AEGIS Combining Robots: Second Ignition lets players assemble teams, led by powerful Commanders with special abilities, of mecha from five different classes – Assault, Evasive, Guard, Intel and Support – and duke it out to try and be the team that comes out on top. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the mechs are strong by themselves, things really heat up when they start combining, turning the game from a strategic tactics game into something reminiscent of the fights out of GunBuster or GaoGaiGear. Manage your energy and pick the right time to combine your bots and grasp victory. For folks who prefer a more cooperative approach, additional modes are included, letting you and a friend take on buffed boss bots that will put your teamwork to the test. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With 100+ mecha, each with its own skill loadout and standee, AEGIS gives you plenty of options for how to make your team, and Second Ignition is compatible with the first game, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOj1N7?object_uuid=233a3f1d-a0c4-4fc0-be24-ccfe59a63870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AEGIS: Combining Robot Strategy Game</a>, which just saw a reprint, giving you even more options. Fans of mecha and tactic games should give AEGIS a look.</p></div><p id="cowboy-bebop-space-serenade"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Cowboy Bebop: Space Serenade">Cowboy Bebop: Space Serenade</h2></p><div id="234403"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234403" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cowboy Bebop: Space Serenade</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As crew members of the spaceship Bebop, in Cowboy Bebop: Space Serenade, you play as bounty hunters racing to take down nefarious criminals, all based on the legendary anime <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/cowboy-bebop">Cowboy Bebop</a>. Space Serenade is a semi-cooperative <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deck builder</a> that's reminiscent of games like Star Realms, where you play cards for their resources and effects to buy new ones to add to your deck or to try and capture your targets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of the four playable characters from the show – Spike, Ed, Faye, and Jet – comes with a set of cards special to them in addition to the generic ones that compose your starting hand. From there, it's a race to collect bounties and earn victory points to prove that you are the best bounty hunter in the galaxy. This game features plastic miniatures of your characters and cards depicting scenes from the anime, creating an authentic and fun deck builder for fans of the genre and source material.</p></div><p id="bullet-star-board-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Bullet Star Board Game">Bullet Star Board Game</h2></p><div id="234404"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234404" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bullet Star Board Game</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Adopting the shoot-’em-up genre of video games for the tabletop, the Bullet series puts you in the role of different anime-like heroes as you avoid quickly approaching bullets and survive long enough to be the last one standing. The Bullet series is a real-time, pattern-matching puzzle game, and instead of shooting at the other players, you frantically attempt to remove the incoming bullets from reaching their own life points. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the course of three-minute rounds, players blindly pull bullet tokens from their bags and spend action points to help rearrange the tokens on their boards into patterns that allow bullets to be destroyed. At the end off each round, the destroyed bullets are moved to the player on their left to be added to the mix, similar to dropping Tetris blocks on your opponent. Bullet is a fast-paced game whose real-time countdown component and puzzle-based gameplay make it a refreshing anime addition to your board game shelf. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

Streamers and everyday Raiders alike have reported dying to cheaters on the high-difficulty map for some time, with the out-of-bounds exploit proving to be especially problematic for months. The clip (above) showcases how the glitch has been used to steal some of the best Arc Raiders loot from players who are looking to extract back to Speranza or even just play some music.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, update 1.12.0 is here to take care of what is maybe Embark’s most infamous exploit, but it sounds like it’s more of a speed bump than a stop sign. Just as the patch made its way to players across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S, Discord users began to report they were still losing runs to Raiders behind walls in Stella Montis. The developer’s patch notes do say that “various” – and not necessarily all – out-of-bounds map locations had been addressed, but that isn’t stopping fans from expressing their disappointment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There is still a wall glitch in Stella (somewhere in the lobby area),” one Discord user said. “Embark is incapable of fixing their game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, I guess they didn’t fix wall glitches because I just got killed by 3 people inside the seed vault extract in Stella Montis,” another added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This patch notes seems like it only attracted rats into walls on Stella,” another player said.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Disattisfaction with the update seems to stem from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1808500/view/527614009105449109?l=english" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a December 11 patch</u></a>, which was said to have tackled an out-of-bounds glitch related to zipline use on Stella Montis, only for players to find themselves still dealing with cheaters weeks later. Players have also shared reports of wall exploits at Dam Battlegrounds and Spaceport, with an ongoing issue related to an unopenable door in Stella Montis adding to the pile of glitches riling up the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark shared earlier this month that out-of-bounds glitches had been added to a list of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters"><u>anti-cheat fixes it hoped to implement</u></a> “over the next few weeks,” suggesting update 1.12.0 may be just one step in a larger plan. While players have waited weeks for exploit fixes, and Stella Montis may have a few holes to fill yet, some say they’re willing to give the studio more time to get Arc Raiders into shape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t know much about game design, but I’m sure it takes a while to find and fix problems within coding,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qhx5zw/comment/o0n5ocv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user argues</u></a>. “So I think people should be happy that they’ve fixed the exploits that have been such a source of complaints for so long.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders launched October 30, 2025, for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X | S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">After a decade of storytelling, Square Enix has decided to wrap up the story of Max Caulfield and Chloe Price in the newly-revealed Life is Strange: Reunion, which is set for launch on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on March 26, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A direct sequel to 2024's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, featuring many of the same secondary characters, Reunion will also finally answer fan wishes by bringing back both beloved faces from the franchise's original 2015 game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Max, who returned as the protagonist of Double Exposure, will reunite with her former lover/best friend Chloe for one final adventure — and for the first time in the same game, both characters will be playable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, there's a sci-fi mystery to solve and limited time to do so — this time, Max's Caledon University must be saved from a deadly fire — and once again, Max can rewind time to remake decisions, while Chloe can use her risk/reward "Backtalk" ability from 2017's Life is Strange: Before the Storm to provoke further responses from others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How is Chloe back, if players previously saw her demise? The story here seems to be that Chloe is now alive regardless after Max merged a pair of disparate timelines in Double Exposure's finale. Returned to life with memories of a past she never lived, Chloe is prompted to seek out Max for answers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This game builds on all the character-led, grounded storytelling for which the Life is Strange series is known, with meaningful choices that affect the outcome of a dramatic and surprising narrative – all culminating in an epic climax that serves as a finale to the Max and Chloe saga," Square Enix wrote today. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Life is Strange: Reunion Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans may be surprised to learn that Max and Chloe's stories will end here, but after a lengthy and often bumpy development road for the franchise, now perhaps feels a good point to ensure their tale gets a definitive ending, with both characters together one final time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember that Don't Nod, the series' original developer, never planned for the characters' stories to continue beyond its initial hit game. Remember also that both Don't Nod and current maker Deck Nine have experienced mixed fortunes with the series since, with the original game's emotional climax still considered by many fans to be the franchise's high point. Finally, there are likely narrative advantages to letting players decide on a final outcome for the pair — something that doesn't need to be unpicked or worked around in any continuation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Life is Strange continue without Max and Chloe? Square Enix doesn't go as far as stating that Reunion is the last Life is Strange game <em>ever </em>— though this feels an ending, for now. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/20/g-ibdyox0aeuhtr-1768932660114.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Farewell, Max and Chloe.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We couldn’t dismiss the tragedy at the heart of Max and Chloe," Life is Strange senior brand manager Andrew James said in an Xbox Wire blog post today. "Their reunion could be no quick fix. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Max and Chloe’s relationship is at the core of the story," James continued, "a relationship that YOU will choose how to develop over the course of the game. Whether Chloe lived or died in Arcadia Bay, and whether she and Max were friends or lovers — these choices are key not just to the <em>past</em> you’ll confirm as you play, but to the <em>future </em>you’ll fight for the chance to build."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon launch, Life is Strange: Reunion will be available for $40. There's also a $50 Deluxe edition featuring a digital soundtrack, art book and comic, and access to a behind-the-scenes documentary with returning Max Caulfield actress Hannah Telle, and Rhianna DeVries, Deck Nine's actress for Chloe Price. (Yes, thankfully there's no cat content sold separately this time around.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're yet to play Double Exposure, a double pack of both games will be available for $60. (It's a solid entry in the series that sets up a new cast of characters we'll see more of in Reunion — and one which Chloe fans may now enjoy more in retrospect.) Finally, a $100 Collector's Edition of Reunion will be available for die-hard fans, featuring a range of physical goods such as a 12" vinyl soundtrack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

With headliners like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokemon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-september-5"><u>Mega Charizard X ex</u></a> taking centre stage, demand ran hot across every major retailer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Featuring six booster bundles, there's still every chance that you'll pull a Mega Charizard X ex double rare, alt rare, or even Secret Art Rare or Gold Rare. I've pulled three normal 'Zard ex's so far, so no need to worry about deck building with Phantasmal Flames.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They also had the <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwZV5?object_uuid=a4e67122-6c4e-4044-aa3f-fa1b60d0cb2d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box live</a>, which is actually available for $74.99 right now, though it's been going in and out of stock as the months have gone by. With that, I'd suggest keeping an eye on that too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What made this set even more exciting is its size, with about 90 cards before secret rares, which makes it the smallest English set in nearly a decade. For collectors like me, that usually means a much more manageable chase, while still packing in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokemon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-august-28">plenty of heavy hitters</a> for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The product lineup altogether for Phantasmal Flames was pretty stacked, too. We got the usual booster packs and booster box (36 packs), a 9-pack Elite Trainer Box featuring a shiny new Charcadet promo, and an Ultra-Premium Collection built around Mega Charizard X ex.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, two theme decks for Mega Gengar ex and Mega Diancie ex arrived a few weeks early on October 24, which was a fun way to get a taste of the set before launch. If you’re like me and love cracking packs, the booster box was the way to go, but the UPC already looked like the big collector piece this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What tied it all together was the <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao6bvY?object_uuid=a4e67122-6c4e-4044-aa3f-fa1b60d0cb2d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Japanese set Inferno X</a>, which hit shelves there in late September. That set had only 80 cards, and once you added in the Mega Gengar and Mega Diancie decks, you basically got the full Phantasmal Flames lineup. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'd already seen some killer reveals, including the Mega Charizard X ex secret rare previewed at Worlds, so I fully expected that to be the chase card when this launches. Between the smaller set size, Charizard hype, and some solid gameplay cards, I'm not surprised this one flew off the shelves and I’m definitely glad I locked in my preorder.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mega Evolution - Released Sept. 26, 2025</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/14/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-preorders-up-today-1752498558521.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mega Evolution - Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just when you thought the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop"><u>Pokémon TCG</u></a> had enough going on with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-destined-rivals-cards"><u>Destined Rivals</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed"><u>Black Bolt and White Flare</u></a>, in came a brand new series altogether with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-brave-mega-symphonia-sets-announced-for-2025">Mega Evolution sets</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced at Japan's Championship tournament, the two new sets featuring Mega Lucario ex and Mega Gardevoir ex marked the popular trading card game stepping away from its Scarlet and Violet era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Evolution released on August 1, 2025, in Japan, and September 26 in English markets (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-where-to-buy">with more preorders also supposedly taking place on September 13</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finding sealed products like these at a fair price became a challenge very quickly.
