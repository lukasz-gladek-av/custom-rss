Central to the dark mystery is the host of eccentric characters and cryptic organizations that inhabit the quarantine zone. These individuals have been cut off from the outside world for years and left to their own devices, so are anything but normal. But be careful, they aren’t all friendly and you will need to get to grips with an array of ranged and melee weapons if you are to survive.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The new trailer, below, is designed to showcase Atomfall’s folk horror influences and the Casterfell Woods location. There’s a burning pyre, an “unsettling” wicker man, numerous fallen bodies, and a ringing telephone box that needs to be answered.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Atomfall’s Deluxe Edition grants three days early access and the planned story expansion DLC, when it’s released.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Here are the Atomfall game features:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>A single-player survival-action game, drawing from science fiction, folk horror and Cold War influences to create a world that is eerily familiar yet completely alien</li><li>Explore a dark and foreboding world with varying environments and locations </li><li>Uncover leads through investigation, exploration, conversation and combat as you attempt to solve a mystery inspired by classic British science fiction such as The Day of the Triffids, early Doctor Who, and The Quatermass Experiment</li><li>Desperate high-stakes combat blends expert marksmanship with vicious hand-to-hand combat</li><li>Craft items and weapons that may save your life, ransack ruined houses for supplies and even unearth hidden treasures using your trusty metal detector</li><li>Define your character through interactions with NPCs, light RPG elements and skill trees</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
