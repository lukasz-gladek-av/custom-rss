And so it has proved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-november-stray-ea-sports-wrc-24-totally-accurate-battle-simulator/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, Sony confirmed Stray, EA Sports WRC 24, and Totally Accurate Battle Simulator as the three games for November. All three are available to PlayStation Plus members from Tuesday November 4 until Monday December 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stray is French studio BlueTwelve’s third-person cat adventure game set in the neon-lit alleys of a decaying cybercity and the murky environments of its seedy underbelly. As a stray cat, you roam surroundings high and low, defending against unforeseen threats and solving the mysteries of this unwelcoming place inhabited by nothing but unassuming droids and dangerous creatures. Lost, alone and separated from family, you must untangle an ancient mystery to escape a long-forgotten cybercity and find the way home.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stray-review">Stray review</a> returned an 8/10.

That's a big part of the reason why four of the cards are multicolored legendary creatures with abilities that are meant to be built around – though the somewhat novel twist of this particular scene is that most of them feature couples from the end of the show, making it a peaceful epiloque of sorts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to those six cards, we've also got a first look at two "Source Material" cards, which can be found in main set booster packs but are only legal in formats where they were already available. These cards use actual shots from the show as their art, tying classic Magic cards into relevant moments from the series, with their episode number listed at the bottom of the card itself. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time we've shown off the Avatar Magic set, as we revealed a hands-on first look at the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-magic-the-gathering-beginner-box-card-reveal-spoilers">Avatar: The Last Airbender Beginner Box</a> back in August. While something like the Scene Box we are revealing today is a solid way to jump into Magic if you are just an Avatar fan more interested in the collection aspect of the game, the Beginner Box is the ideal starting point if you and a friend want to learn how to play from scratch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Card reveals for the set are in full swing through next week, with prerelease events kicking off at local stores on November 14. It then launches digitally on MTG Arena November 18 before becoming available in paper on November 21. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

It has been viewed 43.2 million times so far.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Power to the Players <a href="https://t.co/GqNu0qdgmw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/GqNu0qdgmw</a> <a href="https://t.co/4Hw6G7i7aW" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/4Hw6G7i7aW</a></p>— The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1982638578913206632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It followed Microsoft’s announcement of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved"><u>Halo: Campaign Evolved</u></a>, a remake of the campaign of 2001’s Halo: Combat Evolved, which is due out on Xbox Series X and S, PC, and PlayStation 5 at some point in 2026. It is the first Halo game ever to launch on a PlayStation console, and cements Microsoft’s position as a multiplatform video game developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-remains-quiet-after-trump-ai-master-chief-image-and-homeland-security-uses-halo-to-promote-ice">The Trump administration then doubled down on the Halo AI images</a>, with the Department of Homeland Security using Halo to recruit for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s website (ICE). In a post on social media, now viewed 26 million times, Homeland Security said “destroy the Flood” and “finishing this fight,” referencing Halo’s parasitic alien enemy and its long-running slogan. The use of the Flood here is a clear comparison to the immigrants ICE rounds up for deportation.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Finishing this fight. <a href="https://t.co/6Ezq9NUqMq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6Ezq9NUqMq</a></p>— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) <a href="https://twitter.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">While Microsoft has so far remained silent on the issue (IGN has asked for comment), Marcus Lehto, who was the art director on Combat Evolved and thus heavily involved in the iconic look of Halo itself, slammed the ICE post in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/halo-ice-developers-react" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game File</a>. He called the ICE post “absolutely abhorrent,” adding: “It really makes me sick seeing Halo co-opted like this.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Game File also spoke with Jaime Griesemer, another one of the key developers behind Halo and who was most involved with designing Halo’s famous ‘30 seconds of fun’ gameplay loop. He was less bothered by the Trump post, but took issue with the ICE post.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Using Halo imagery in a call to ‘destroy’ people because of their immigration status goes way too far, and ought to offend every Halo fan, regardless of political orientation,” Griesemer said. “I personally find it despicable. The Flood are evil space zombie parasites and are not an allegory to any group of people.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “I think Halo’s world is rich and wide and has layers that reward a deeper look, and it has had an outsized impact on culture, so it is easy to read into it and see elements of current or historical events.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But it was NOT written as an allegory to any specific religion or political party or movement. The Prophets are not Popes, the Grunts are not Wahhabis, and the Flood are definitely not illegal immigrants. The Master Chief is not a Christ figure and Cortana is not the Virgin Mary, I guess?”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Trump meme, the White House is claiming it is about Trump claiming credit for ending another war (in this case, the console war). White House Deputy Press Secretary Kush Desai <a href="https://substack.com/redirect/1848a389-fc9a-48b1-baac-af4bcda68224?j=eyJ1IjoiMm92ODhqIn0.yKedhX7RsNV5FJ_1TIjv7aY5K1HeEMhxHfbD0OI_ra4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>told reporter</u></a> Alyssa Mercante in a statement: “Yet another war ended under President Trump's watch — only one leader is fully committed to giving power to the players, and that leader is Donald J. Trump. That’s why he’s hugely popular with the American people and American Gamers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft’s silence on the matter is in contrast to The Pokémon Company’s position. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this"><u>It formally responded</u></a> to the use of Pokémon TV hero Ash Ketchum and the series' theme tune by the Department of Homeland Security as part of a video showing people being arrested and handcuffed by law enforcement agents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are aware of a recent video posted by the Department of Homeland Security that includes imagery and language associated with our brand," The Pokémon Company International said in a statement shared with IGN. "Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/29/gettyimages-2243239853-1761752999990.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Trump Master Chief AI image was about the end of the console war, the White House has said. Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is, can Microsoft do anything about the Trump administration using Halo for promotion? Many fans had suggested The Pokémon Company should defend its intellectual property by launching legal action. But the corporation's former legal chief told IGN at the time that he "wouldn't touch this."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't see them doing anything about this for a few reasons," McGowan, now principal at Extreme Grownup Services, told IGN. "First, think of how little you see [The Pokémon Company International]'s name in the press. They are INSANELY publicity-shy and prefer to let the brand be the brand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Second, many of their execs in the USA are on green cards," he continued. "Even if I was still at the company I wouldn't touch this, and I'm the most trigger-happy CLO [Chief Legal Officer] I've ever met. This will blow over in a couple of days and they'll be happy to let it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Trump administration has form when it comes to using AI images to promote the President. In May, Trump sparked a backlash from some Catholics after posting an AI-generated image of himself as the Pope. The picture, which was shared by official White House social media accounts, was released as Catholics mourned the death of Pope Francis and prepared to choose the next pontiff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The White House has also released AI images of Trump as Superman and as a Star Wars Jedi. And when the Department of Homeland Security used South Park to promote ICE, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/us-homeland-security-uses-south-park-to-promote-ice-south-park-trolls-trump-in-response-wait-so-we-are-relevant"><u>South Park trolled Trump in response, saying: “wait, so we ARE relevant?”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
