            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-projected-to-make-over-3-billion-in-its-first-year-on-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is projected to make an eye-watering $3 billion in its first year on sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar’s hotly anticipated open-world crime caper is currently due out fall 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, with no word on a PC release for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A new report by the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1413cdb1-aee9-422f-8b78-15aa0bf40dca" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Times</a>, based on analysis by video game research group DFC Intelligence, predicts GTA 6 will exceed $1 billion in pre-orders before it even launches. Surprising no-one, GTA 6 is expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of 2025, ahead of any movie or competing video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DFC predicted total revenue from GTA 6’s first 12 months on sale will reach $3.2 billion. To put that into context, 2024’s highest-grossing movie, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/inside-out-2">Inside Out 2</a>, made just shy of $1.7 billion at the global box office. In 2013, it took <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> just three days to surpass $1 billion in sales — the fastest to that figure in entertainment history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Strauss Zelnick, boss of Rockstar parent company Take-Two, told the Financial Times: “I never claim victory before it occurs. That said, I think Rockstar Games will once again deliver something absolutely phenomenal… Certainly the anticipation is high.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The huge projected revenue of GTA 6 is up against similarly huge development costs, which the Financial Times estimates from the high hundreds of millions to as much as $2 billion. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-lot-riding-on-gta-6-and-not-just-for-rockstar-and-take-two">There’s a lot riding on GTA 6, then, but not just for Take-Two and Rockstar</a>. In March last year, Circana analyst Mat Piscatella predicted Rockstar’s surefire hit would spark “renewed interest” in video games, before going one step further: “There's probably never been a more important thing to ever release in the industry, so no pressure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 is the kind of game that will sell consoles. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-likely-out-later-in-2024-analysts-say"><u>Sony’s PS5 Pro</u></a> will no doubt benefit greatly from interest in GTA 6, too. Let’s remember: GTA 6 is not coming out on PC at launch; to play you <em>must </em>own a PlayStation or an Xbox. Beyond the point of sale, GTA 6’s GTA Online equivalent will surely come packed with microtransactions as the current GTA Online does. Microsoft and Sony will get their cut of any money spent there, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the Financial Times points out, the almost guaranteed success of GTA 6 comes amid one of the toughest periods for the video game industry in recent memory. More than 33,000 people have lost their jobs since 2022, with huge layoffs at the likes of Microsoft and Sony. Indeed, Take-Two itself has suffered layoffs and studio closures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are on Rockstar for a firm GTA 6 release date, or, as some are predicting, a delay into 2026. While you wait to find out, IGN has much more on GTA 6 to check out, including an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, the boss of Take-Two's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response"><u>coy response on whether GTA 6 is coming to PC</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

"Good to see and hear from some many of you. May the next quarter century deliver as many unexpected surprises, hmm, as did the millennium’s first. Then again time is fluid like music. See you in the new year!”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Valve?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Valve</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Halflife?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Halflife</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GMan?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GMan</a> #2025 <a href="https://t.co/mdT5hlxKJT" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/mdT5hlxKJT</a></p>— Mike Shapiro (@mikeshapiroland) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeshapiroland/status/1874213952680607922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 31, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That’s pretty vague, but as many fans have pointed out, this is Shapiro’s first non-reply tweet since he congratulated Valve on the success of VR exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a> back in December 2020. A Shapiro tweet, then, is a rare thing indeed. But does this latest one mean anything?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Half-Life 2 recently turned 20 years old, and still there’s no official Half-Life 3 announcement from Valve despite the story ending on a cliffhanger with 2007’s Episode 2. In 2020, a making-of for Half-Life: Alyx revealed a swathe of games developed and shelved by Valve between the release of Half-Life 2: Episode 2 and Valve's latest VR game. That list included details on a version of Half-Life 3 that was in development for around a year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.alyxfinalhours.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Geoff Keighley's The Final Hours of Half-Life: Alyx</u></a> revealed that at least five Half-Life games were canceled between Episode 2 and Alyx, along with a number of other projects — the most notable of which was referred to within Valve as Half-Life 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In November, to mark Half-Life 2's 20th anniversary, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/never-before-seen-half-life-2-episode-3-gameplay-footage-and-ice-gun-revealed-in-new-documentary">Valve opened up about its development</a> in a documentary that revealed never-before-seen work-in-progress footage, a brand-new Ice Gun, and a raft of new concept art. You can see the gameplay segment from the documentary in the video below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the details shown in the video, Episode 3 would have been set in the Arctic, and it would have focused on Alyx as a companion character. Aside from the Ice Gun, the footage shows a blob-like enemy that could split into multiple parts. According to the documentary, the team had completed a "collection of playable levels in no particular order" and expected to be able to release the game within a year or two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve has plenty on its plate already, of course, including ongoing support of Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, Steam itself, the Steam Deck, and new game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>. Could it also be working on Half-Life 3 alongside all those other projects?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

The Series S has 4TF of GPU compute compared to the Xbox Series X’s 12.2TF, but the killer is the drop in memory allocation, from 16GB down to 10GB.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft’s Xbox release policy means publishers and developers must release their games across Xbox Series X and S. They are unable to release a game for Xbox Series X only, for example. This has caused difficulty for some studios in the past, perhaps most notably <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> developer Larian. Baldur's Gate 3 was originally released on PC and PS5 only, with the Xbox version delayed due to issues with the Xbox Series S specifically struggling to perform splitscreen co-op. In the past, Xbox had committed to parity between Xbox Series S and X for all games, but it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-wins-big-concession-allowing-it-to-launch-on-xbox-in-2023"><u>ultimately made an exception for Baldur's Gate 3</u></a> so the game could launch later in 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2023, Remedy communications director Thomas Puha <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-opens-up-about-challenges-developing-alan-wake-2-for-xbox-series-s">talked openly about the challenge the studio faced getting Alan Wake 2 running well on the Xbox Series S</a>, saying the console’s GPU “is an issue” and “having less memory is a pretty big problem.” Before then, a VFX artist who had worked on an Xbox Series X and S game said in a now-deleted tweet that “many developers have been sitting in meetings for the past year desperately trying to get Series S launch requirements dropped”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Studios have been through one development cycle where Series S turned out to be an albatross around the neck of production, and now that games are firmly being developed with new consoles in mind, teams do not want to repeat the process,” the developer said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In interviews with press including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-insists-games-launch-across-xbox-series-x-and-s-despite-baldurs-gate-3-no-show"><u>IGN</u></a>, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has deflected questions about whether Xbox Series S is holding developers back, and rejected calls for developers to be allowed to release their games on Xbox Series X only. In an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-definitive-xbox-gamescom-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Eurogamer</u></a>, Spencer said: "Having an entry-level price point for a sub-$300 console is a good thing for the industry. I think it's important. The Switch has been able to do that, in terms of kind of the traditional plug-into-my-television consoles. I think it's important. So, we're committed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The situation with Black Myth: Wukong, however, is further muddled by Microsoft’s insistence that the game’s delay on Xbox has nothing to do with development issues. In a number of statements issued to IGN, Microsoft has suggested an exclusivity deal with Sony was the cause of the delay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As we have said before, we’re excited for the launch of Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Series X and S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms,” Microsoft has told IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We'd prefer not to comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders but we can confirm that the delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Myth: Wukong launched on August 19 and sold an eye-watering 18 million copies in just two weeks across PC and PS5, reportedly making over $700 million in revenue in the process. That was enough to put Black Myth: Wukong up there with Grand Theft Auto 5 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 as one of the fastest-selling games of all time, and is an astonishing return for a game that had a reported budget of $70 million over six years of development. It did so well that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-points-to-black-myth-wukong-success-in-big-playstation-quarter-after-concord-disaster"><u>Sony pointed to Black Myth: Wukong as making a significant contribution to revenue</u></a> during its last financial quarter, making up for the Concord disaster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DLC is set to follow. In September, Game Science investor Hero Games confirmed plans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-following-elden-rings-lead-with-dlc-expansion-before-any-sequel"><u>to release an Elden Ring-style expansion for Black Myth: Wukong ahead of any sequel</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc"><u>Black Myth: Wukong review</u></a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Despite some frustrating technical issues, Black Myth: Wukong is a great action game with fantastic combat, exciting bosses, tantalizing secrets, and a beautiful world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you’re here, IGN has plenty more Black Myth: Wukong guides to help you out, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Essential Tips and Tricks</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Things_Black_Myth_Wukong_Doesn%27t_Tell_You"><u>Things Black Myth: Wukong Doesn't Tell You</u></a>, and our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Boss_List_and_Guides"><u>Boss List and Guides</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
