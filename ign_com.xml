            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plans to relaunch the game.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy, the Edinburgh, Scotland-based developer of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a>, has issued at-risk emails to its around 300-strong UK workforce following the disastrous launch of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sources familiar with the goings on inside the embattled studio told IGN at-risk emails were also sent to staff at PlayFusion, which BARB acquired late 2024. PlayFusion, whose CEO Mark Gerhard became co-CEO of BARB as part of the buyout, is working on a different game — a fast-paced FPS called Ascendant which was meant to come out this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">IGN reported that BARB had begun a redundancy process following the release of MindsEye</a>. The standard 45-day consultation process kicked off on June 23, which according to UK law is triggered when an employer proposes 100 or more redundancies within a 90-day period. IGN understands Build A Rocket Boy currently has around 300 UK employees, with 200 abroad.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, BARB issued a statement confirming the redundancy process, insisting the cuts will let the studio “focus on delivering ongoing updates and performance optimization for MindsEye, while also ensuring the long-term success of Build A Rocket Boy’s future ambitions.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Soon after MindsEye launched, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-heartbroken-amid-troubled-launch-as-players-report-success-with-refunds-and-sponsored-streams-are-canceled-last-minute"><u>BARB said it was “heartbroken” over the issues players had faced with the game</u></a>, and promised to release a series of patches to fix the significant performance problems, glitches, and AI behavior bugs. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-releases-performance-improvement-hotfix-as-first-in-series-of-emergency-patches-designed-to-address-disastrous-launch"><u>Rollout of these patches has begun</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the while, MindsEye’s troubled launch saw the developer cancel sponsored streams, with reports of players securing refunds, even from the normally stubborn Sony, surfacing online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, which does not paint the whole picture of MindsEye’s current popularity, the game hit a peak concurrent player count of 3,302 on launch, but had a 24-hour peak of just 46 players. At the time of this article’s publication, 26 people were playing on Steam, where MindsEye has a 'mostly negative' user review rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Story-driven action adventure game MindsEye was initially designed to be a part of Everywhere, the ‘Roblox for adults’ creation platform led by former Grand Theft Auto design chief Leslie Benzies. BARB eventually switched to focus on MindsEye, but it has so-far failed to do the business for the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, BARB sources told IGN that Benzies finally addressed staff following the release of MindsEye in a brief video call yesterday, July 2. According to two people present who asked not to be named in order to protect their careers, Benzies insisted BARB would bounce back and relaunch MindsEye, blaming the studio and the game’s struggles on internal and external saboteurs, among other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The comments rekindle memories of those issued by Mark Gerhard ahead of the release of MindsEye. The co-CEO hit the headlines for claiming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments"><u>there was a "concerted effort" by some to "trash the game and the studio,"</u></a> suggesting people were being paid or using spam bots to post negative comments. The boss of publisher IO Interactive, which makes the Hitman games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye"><u>subsequently issued a denial</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BARB sources told IGN that internally, there is a desire for a MindsEye redemption arc that would eventually see it become successful for the studio. But as staff face an anxious wait to discover their fate, there are serious questions over whether BARB will be able to fulfill its post-launch roadmap for content, including the promised multiplayer mode, on time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, BARB released MindsEye’s third post-release update on console, with a PC release to follow. “We’ve watched hundreds of hours of gameplay footage and reviewed player feedback across multiple channels to prioritize the most pressing issues and improve the experience for all our console players,” the studio said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Though it had been in development since 2018, the length of time it was taking to make the game was expected, as ZeniMax was building an entirely new game engine for it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the last year, sources tell IGN that pre-production was going well, and the team was actively ramping up in the hope of moving into full production soon. Xbox had approved the scaling up, and some individuals were being moved onto the project from other teams such as The Elder Scrolls Online, as well as some people absorbed from the shuttering last year of Arkane Austin.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One source recalled being told last year by head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty in a meeting that Xbox's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">closures</a> of Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog Games were done for the purpose of justifying increased headcount for other game studios that needed it, including ZeniMax Online Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But now, every person working on Blackbird is gone. The project has been cancelled, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unannounced-mmo-from-the-elder-scrolls-online-dev-canceled-veteran-studio-head-steps-down-amid-microsoft-layoffs">ZeniMax Online Studios head Matt Firor has stepped down</a>. Sources IGN spoke to said that those within ZeniMax only knew that layoffs were coming due to ongoing news reports leading up to yesterday, but even today are still in the dark as to how widespread the cuts actually are. They also confirmed reports that a number of people's Slack access was deactivated before they were told by HR that they were impacted, resulting in confusion and distress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft's mass layoffs have devastated its games division, and our understanding of the impact is still evolving. IGN was told that Candy Crush developer King was hit hard, and we learned yesterday that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">Perfect Dark has been canceled and The Initiative is no more</a>.

A number of other games and teams are rumored to be impacted as well, though the full scope is still unknown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes on the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce"><u>Microsoft's laying off 1,900 staff in January 2024</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda"><u>closing Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks months later</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff"><u>laying off 650 more individuals in gaming the following September,</u></a> and then in May of this year Microsoft laying off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-cuts-3-of-its-workforce-affecting-thousands-of-staff"><u>an additional 6,000 people.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: zenimaxonline.com.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> is coming to Xbox Series X and S next month in a shock announcement that sees Sony publish a game on PlayStation's rival consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead’s explosive co-op third-person shooter launches on Xbox on August 26, 2025, a livestream confirmed. Remarkably, that's the same day Microsoft releases Gears of War: Reloaded on PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-xbox-release-date-pre-order/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>, Helldivers 2 Game Director Mikael Eriksson commented on what this launch means to the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more Helldivers into our game," he said. "We have so much more in store for the future months and years – and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Crossplay across all platforms is confirmed, which means PC, PlayStation, and Xbox players will be able to play together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 launched on PC and PS5 in February 2024 and was a rare live service smash hit for Sony. It is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time, selling an incredible 12 million copies in 12 weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While player numbers on Steam, which Valve makes public, remain healthy a year-and-a-half on from the record-breaking launch, the Xbox release will no-doubt boost the player pool even further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Helldivers 2's release on Xbox comes as a big surprise. Sony, typically, does not release PlayStation Studios games on Xbox, preferring instead to launch on PlayStation consoles only and, in an increasing number of cases, PC. MLB The Show, developed by Sony's San Diego Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment, is an exception and does launch on Xbox, albiet under the MLB banner. Sony also recently released LEGO Horizon Adventures on Nintendo Switch, PS5, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clearly, the once impenetrable walls of console exclusivity are coming down. Microsoft, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">which only yesterday made sweeping cuts to its gaming business as part of an eye-watering round of layoffs affecting over 9,000 staff</a>, is all-in on PlayStation. The aforementioned Gears of War: Reloaded marks the once Xbox-exclusive series' debut on PlayStation, Hellblade 2 hits PS5 in August, and Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2 releases on Sony's console in October.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

You can then spend that money to buy rarer capybaras or if you're feeling mischievous, you can take from other players. But you'll want to make sure you have gadgets to smack away others while also avoiding traps that can stun you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you've gained a ton of money you can reset your base by rebirthing. This unlocks new items and can even expand your base for more capybaras too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jeffrey Lerman is a freelance game journalist for IGN who has been covering games for over a decade.

Alongside the new hunts, Capcom took aim at some of the performance issues that have been plaguing the PC version, specifically, though opinions seem mixed on whether it succeeded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Monster Hunter Wilds' <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-breezes-past-10-million-sold-capcom-explains-why-its-done-so-incredibly-well">impressive</a> sales numbers, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-accounted-for-more-than-half-of-monster-hunter-wilds-total-dollar-sales-in-the-us">especially on PC</a>, the Steam reviews have painted a different picture. Wilds garnered a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-mixed-steam-user-review-rating-capcom-issues-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-troubleshooting-guide">"Mixed" review rating</a> around launch. In response, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-director-commits-to-addressing-stability-issues-with-pc-improvements-coming-in-title-update-1">director Yuya Tokuda committed to stability and improvements</a> as updates started rolling out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Patch Ver. 1.02.00.00 for the Steam version of Monster Hunter Wilds, among all the new monsters and quests, Capcom takes aim at several factors for the PC version, including DLSS4 and FSR4 support for graphics upscaling and additional frame generation updates.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The response has been all over the place. In our own research online, we found examples of players <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1lo1w9q/me_when_the_update_actually_fixed_performance_and/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reporting genuine improvements</a>.

On July 1, the first day after Title Update 2 went live, 208 Positive reviews were submitted to the Steam storefront compared to 1,418 Negative reviews.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Title Update 2 deleted my save data of 239 hours," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/PlayerPhase/recommended/2246340/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one review reads</a>. "I've reached a quiet acceptance of losing 239 hours of playtime alongside all my loadouts, layered armor, events, saved characters, stats, guild card, hunt log, and achievements.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is out, and as porters worldwide begin trekking across Hideo Kojima’s newest adventure, all sorts of little secrets and discoveries are being uncovered. While much attention will be paid to the grand, cinematic experience on display, Kojima also went ahead and stuffed Death Stranding 2 to the gills with little flourishes and details, some obvious, some very, very hidden.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve compiled a list of all the little details that help bring the world of Death Stranding 2 to life, from easter eggs to ingenious gameplay we can’t believe Kojima Productions thought to even add in the first place. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Death Stranding 2: 45 Amazing Details That Blew Us Away</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">1. The best part of Death Stranding 2 is seeing how the natural world interacts with Sam, or how Sam interacts with the natural world. Given that this is a game about traversing the different biomes of Australia, Sam will naturally get dirty, and this will be reflected on Sam’s character model. He’ll be covered in dirt, snow, and sludge after long journeys, which will require you to take showers to clean off.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701165334-1751416322609.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">2. It’s not limited to just the elements, either. After an intense fight, Sam will also become covered by the blood of his enemies. While this might make him look very battle hardened, it probably isn’t how Sam wants to present himself when he’s on deliveries, so be sure to clean off the blood in the shower too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">3. When not covered in grime, even just exposure to the sun can affect Sam’s appearance. He’ll turn redder as he gets more and more sunburnt, to the point where he can start resembling a cherry tomato in the face. Taking a shower will heal these burns, so bathe regularly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">4. However, if you decide to take off your backpack before showering, you’ll find that while you become clean, your backpack will stay dirty. Why you'd take your pack into the shower is beyond me, but it's better than carrying around a dirty pack, I suppose.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701165429-1751416322609.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">5. If you can’t make it to a shower, hopping into a lake or river will clear off some of the dirt up to the point you submerge yourself. Meaning if you only dip your shoes into the river, your boots will be clean, but the rest of you won’t be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">6. There are all sorts of different weather conditions in the world of Death Stranding 2, all of which will hit in real-time.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pre-order-trailer-mp4-00-03-15-11-still012-1741556559512.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">7. The earliest natural event you encounter is the sandstorm, which severely impairs Sam’s visibility, forcing you to rely on your Odradek scanner to scope out the terrain. When the storm gets particularly bad, you’ll lose stamina and will need to hide behind large structures to shield yourself from the storm.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250615164856-1751416322606.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">8. Other natural disasters include blizzards that, like a sandstorm, will impair Sam’s vision and slow him down. Plus, when Sam’s too cold, his stamina will deplete faster than normal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">9. Lastly, thunderstorms will also strike Sam when he’s out and about. The rain in Death Stranding 2 is known to degrade Sam’s cargo and equipment faster than usual so be sure to find shelter fast to prevent your packages from getting damaged. And watch out for lightning strikes. While I haven’t seen anyone get hit by one yet (unlike in The Legend of Zelda), they can strike awfully close to Sam if he’s not careful.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701165537-1751416322610.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">10. What’s more, you can even see these weather events in real-time from afar. Meaning if there’s a blizzard happening on a mountaintop, you can see it from the base of the mountain.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/img-8382-1751420229357.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">11. Dust, rain, snow, and even chiral creatures build up on the screen when you spend too long in them, which adds to the immersive and cinematic approach Kojima takes with his games.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701164157-1751416322609.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">12. If you’re in the high heat of the desert too long you’ll begin to see mirages of rivers flowing through the sands. But as you get closer you’ll realize there’s no water there. Sorry.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/screenshot-2025-07-01-at-3-27-11-pm-1751416696816.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">13. Depending on which biome you’re in, whether it’s the hot desert or freezing mountaintops, Sam will take either a cold shower to cool off, or a hot shower to warm up.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/19/master-00-02-10-57-still013-1750343168746.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">14. As you and other porters begin carving paths through the world of Death Stranding 2 to make deliveries, you’ll find that regularly used paths become roads by themselves from being worn down, making them easier to traverse over time.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701170700-1751416322610.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">15. Rivers will also rise and fall with the rain. Some rivers become flooded under heavy rainfall, making them more difficult to traverse than under dry conditions.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/screenshot-2025-07-01-at-3-36-37-pm-1751416696816.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">16. The iconic image of Death Stranding as a series is Sam carrying a stack of boxes on his back. That’s because his porter job is inspired by the Japanese Bokka porter who transport boxes to homes that aren’t reachable by trucks or cars. There are references to the Bokka in dialogues with other porters and even a Bokka skeleton for Sam, which make it easier for him to traverse difficult terrain like rivers, inclines, and snow.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/img-8383-1751420229357.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">17. One of the most useful vehicles is the Pickup Off-Roader, which lets you haul tons of packages across long-distances. Depending on how and where it’s parked, Sam changes the way he climbs into the driver’s seat.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701170543-1751416322610.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">18. Ramps are invaluable when it comes to getting your vehicle across large gaps. But depending on what vehicle you use to jump the ramp, whether it’s on a vehicle, your floating carrier you ride like a skateboard, or even just using a skeleton on your legs, you can even do some cool skateboard and acrobatic tricks off the ramp.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701162151-1751416322608.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">19. Some Pickups aren’t driveable because they belong to specific shelters. Weirdly, Pickups that aren’t owned by Sam or Drawbridge feature the logo of Yamato Transport, a real-life Japanese delivery company.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701162026-1751416322608.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">20. There are numerous monorail lines you can build across Death Stranding 2 at set points, much like the roads you can build in Death Stranding 1 and 2. But they’re not just for trains as you can use a zip line to attach yourself to a monorail pole and travel that way.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701170006-1751416322610.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">21. But if you’re inclined to travel on foot, always remember to wear shoes! Walking barefoot too long will eventually cause Sam’s feet to bleed, which leaves a trail of blood behind. While you'll still be able to get around without shoes, Sam will refuse to run given how uncomfortable it is on his toes.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701155854-1751416322607.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">22. If you choose to give Sam a rest while on the road, or leave your controller idle for too long, Sam will have a nice sit down to catch a breather, at which point a floating Lou will appear over Sam’s head as he dreams about her.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/img-8385-1751422116928.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">23. While it might be fun to see how high you can stack boxes on your back, be careful of your surroundings as tall stacks of boxes won’t fit through certain doors and will instead topple over if they hit the ceiling, forcing you to pick them up again.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/screenshot-2025-07-01-at-5-51-40-pm-1751417560089.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">24. There are also special timed events set to specific dates, just like in the first Death Stranding. At the beginning of the game you’re asked to input your birthday. And if you boot up the game on your special day a unique cutscene will trigger where all your friends (and enemy) will wish you a happy birthday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">25. More than that, if you go out into the world and use the call out feature, other NPC porters will wish you a happy birthday too.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/img-8384-1751420229357.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">26. Your birthday isn’t the only special day. Playing Death Stranding 2 on Christmas day will add Christmas Tree holograms to shelters and give NPCs little Santa hats to wear to celebrate the joyous occasion. If you don’t want to wait for Christmas or your birthday, changing your PS5’s internal clock to the correct date will trigger these events.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/26/ds-pr-blog-1750947107288.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">27. While Death Stranding 2 isn’t purely about combat, there are a ton of ways to fight the BTs. Sam’s blood already has anti-BT properties making Blood Grenades lethal to BTs, but shooting a normal bullet through the blood cloud left behind the grenade will make them deadly against BTs too.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701165002-1751416322609.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">28. Guns aren’t your only weapons in a fight. If you <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/Connection_Level_Rewards_-_Weapons,_Items,_Upgrades_and_Star_Rating_Unlocks"><u>unlock the secret cutscene for the Pizza Chef</u></a> (played by Ghost in the Shell director Mamoru Oshii), you’ll unlock an entire new martial arts fighting style based around the delicious meal.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701164919-1751416322609.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">29. One of your constant companions on the road is Dollman, who you can throw up high into the air to do reconnaissance on enemy bases. But you can also throw him straight at an enemy to temporarily stun them.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/19/master-00-13-11-36-still041-1750343168751.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">30. Unlike other weapons, Dollman is a living being and he will eventually get mad at you if you throw him at too many enemies, or let him drop to the ground after a recon trip. If he’s upset, he won’t let you throw him for a while.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701161604-1751416322608.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">31. Bandits in Death Stranding 2 are often equipped with stun rods that blast waves of electricity. However, if you have the Electric Shock Absorber add-on for you backpack, you can turn their electric attacks into power for your battery.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/screenshot-2025-07-01-at-5-49-44-pm-1751417424510.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Eurogamer</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">32. Boss fights return in Death Stranding 2, and while you should have all the weapons and tools to get through them, some are incredibly tough and can cause you to die repeatedly. If a fight is too annoying, the game will trigger a “Pretend You Won” option to skip the fight in exchange for a small impact to your overall mission score.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701161415-1751416322608.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">33. Death Stranding 2 is populated by a ton of survivors, many with familiar faces, and if you make enough deliveries to them they might give you some unique items. The Data Scientist, who is a famous Vtuber named Usada Pekora, will give you a bunny hood that makes Sam say “Peko” after each sentence, similar to Pekora’s verbal tic. Peko.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701161445-1751416322608.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">34. The Peko hood is only one of a variety of hoods and hats you can earn in Death Stranding 2 with others giving Sam unique abilities. The camel hood will protect Sam from the heat of the desert and refill his water for stamina, and the seal hood returns which lets Sam safely float across rivers. One gooey looking Chiral Roden hat will even ward away Chiral Creatures.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701154746-1751416322607.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">35. Shelters house different survivors, and depending on their real-life counterpart, will have little nods to their identities. The Adventurer and his son who are played by RRR director SS Rajamouli and SS karthikeya, for example, their holograms outside their shelter has them doing an iconic pose from their hit film.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701161239-1751416322608.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">36. Another shelter in Australia is an animal sanctuary overseen by members of a conservationist group, played by the music group CHVRCHES. If you rescue animals and send them to the sanctuary, the group will send you social media pics of the animal living happily in their new home.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701161342-1751416322608.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">37. However, you have to be careful when traveling because you can accidentally run over and kill these poor creatures if you’re not paying attention. Which is one way to earn dislikes in the world of Death Stranding 2. While a lot of what you do in the world will get you likes from your fellow porters and shelter dwellers, there are ways to have likes taken away, and accidental animal killing is one of them.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/screenshot-2025-07-01-at-5-46-33-pm-1751417234985.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">38. There are also a ton of scares in Death Stranding 2. During certain times, Sam will get nightmares while sleeping aboard the DHV Magellan, which trigger some frankly terrifying cutscenes, including one notable one that features a mannequin doing some freaky stuff.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pre-order-trailer-mp4-00-04-58-11-still022-1741556559513.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">39. There are scares out in the world too. One mission revolves around a Ghost Track haunted by Headless Bikers. Find them and you’ll trigger a unique boss fight.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701171225-1751416322610.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">40. There is also a haunted monorail train that only appears at night. You can sometimes see it as it passes by you while you're riding the monorail, or you can see it flying through the sky on its own. It gives a sinister red glow as it passes by and triggers your odradek, implying the train is full of BTs.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pre-order-trailer-mp4-00-06-22-26-still035-1741556559514.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">41. It’s not all scares and monsters though. There are plenty of pleasant experiences to be found aboard the DHV Magellan and elsewhere. On the ship, one crewmate, Rainy, will give Sam intermittent trivia quizzes with some special prizes for getting the correct answer.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701160434-1751416322608.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">42. Dollman, who hangs out with you in your cabin, will not only talk with you whenever you want, but playing ‘Horizon Dreamer’ by Daichi Miura while chatting triggers a fun dance from him.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701160232-1751416322607.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">43. Sam is also apparently an avid reader given the stack of books in his cabin. If you pick up a copy of Frankenstein, Dollman will mention a movie about the fictional doctor starring Elle Fanning, the actor of Tomorrow.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/screenshot-2025-07-01-at-7-01-17-pm-1751421735080.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">44. The Pizza Chef, who is a fountain of many little surprises, will eventually make Sam a Pac-Man shaped pizza that, once eaten, turns Sam’s world map into a minigame of Atari classic.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701160121-1751416322607.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">45. One very special item you can receive is an instant camera that unlocks a unique photo mode. Unlike the default photo mode, this camera can only be used aboard the DHV Magellan and can be used to take photos of Fragile, Tomorrow, and Rainy. These photos can then be given to crewmates or used to decorate your room, and the photo you take yourself will even appear in a cutscene towards the end of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are our favorite details and hidden easter eggs we’ve come across in Death Stranding 2.

I'm afraid we're given no more than a vague "coming 2025" for now, but publisher NetEase has confirmed its final test is set to launch on July 25 on PC and PS5, which includes a brand-new urban region, Kaifeng, which hasn't previously been available.

It's set in the Ten Kingdoms Era during a battle between rival dynasties, where the player takes the role of a swordsman who will influence the conflict in different ways depending on their choices. It's influenced heavily by Wuxia, a Chinese fiction genre where ancient Chinese fighters are depicted with superhuman abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-winds-meet-is-a-huge-rpg-with-weird-and-wild-ambitions-gamescom-2023"><u>Where Winds Meet preview from August 2023</u></a>, we went hands-on, getting a taste of its mix of Zelda and The Witcher gameplay and the seemingly massive amount of systems, choices, and possibilities at play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Sony, it's on the hunt for a repeat of the enormous success of Black Myth Wukong, which launches on Xbox Series X and S this August a year after it came out on PC and PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
