"I personally thought it was a really strong game. I thought it was just BioWare being more BioWare. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I also think a lot of people kind of wanted to see it fail, or wanted to see [BioWare] fail, either because they're just really bad people on the internet — of which there are unfortunately many, as we have discovered."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At launch, The Veilguard was review-bombed online. Criticism of the game being "woke" centred on its inclusion of a non-binary companion character, and the ability for the player to choose to be transgender. On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>, Dragon Age: The Veilguard now sits with a 'Mixed' player respose, with user-defined tags for the game describing it under "LGBTQ+" and "politics" labels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"People were attacking the game before it was released," Wilton Regan continued. "It's ridiculous. How can you judge a game, a book, a film, a TV show before it's actually released? You can't. It's an idiotic stance to take."</p><div id="rank-the-best-dragon-age-veilguard-companions" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank the Best Dragon Age Veilguard Companions</h3><h3>Rank the Best Dragon Age Veilguard Companions</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In January, publisher EA said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-15-million-players-in-first-two-months-ea-expected-3-million">Dragon Age: The Veilguard had "underperformed" versus its expectations by around 50%</a>, just days after the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-reportedly-exits-bioware">game's director Corrine Busche confirmed she was leaving</a> the company. Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">other BioWare staff who worked on the game were laid off</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-patch-notes-sure-make-it-sound-like-biowares-basically-done-with-the-game-now">BioWare signalled it had released its final update for Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, with no further content announced or expected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I only ever want to see the folks from BioWare thrive, because I adore them," Wilton Regan concluded. "And whatever they go on to do next I have no doubt their talents will be richly rewarded. We're really lucky we'll get more gold from them in the future."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A slimmed-down BioWare is now working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-next-chapter">Mass Effect 5</a>, which currently does not have a release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/confirmed-mortal-kombat-1-wont-get-any-more-dlc-characters-or-story-chapters-as-netherrealm-needs-to-shift-focus-to-the-next-project<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. has confirmed what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> fans feared after the recent launch of the Definitive Edition: no new DLC characters or story chapters will be released for the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat 1 has sold 5 million copies, with the franchise now up to 100 million. Mortal Kombat 11 became the best-selling game in the franchise by passing Mortal Kombat X's nearly 11 million units sold worldwide soon after launch. By 2022, Mortal Kombat 11 had sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. Clearly, Mortal Kombat 1 has underperformed compared to previous games in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020816879206810" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a> on the official Mortal Kombat social media account, Warner Bros. acknowledged the disappointment the news will cause players, "but our team at NetherRealm needs to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. failed to say what this new project is, but current speculation points to Injustice 3, a continuation of NetherRealm’s DC fighting game series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement in full:</p><blockquote>We are hearing players’ requests for continued game support of Mortal Kombat 1, and, while we will continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes, there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released from this point on.</blockquote><blockquote>We understand this will be disappointing for fans, but our team at NetherRealm needs to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">March 2025's release of the T-1000 guest character, which came a year-and-a-half after the release of Mortal Kombat 1 itself, now goes down as the game’s final major content drop. For context, in July 2021, NetherRealm announced it had started work on its next project (Mortal Kombat 1) and, as a result, there would be no further DLC for Mortal Kombat 11. That announcement came two years and three months after the release of the game. Today’s announcement comes one year and eight months after the release of Mortal Kombat 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are already bringing up prior comments from NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon, who had promised fans years of support. Indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago"><u>many are now pointing to a September 2024 tweet from Boon</u></a>, who at the time moved to reassure fans already concerned that the studio had moved onto its next game by saying: “NetherRealm is still fully committed to supporting Mortal Kombat 1 for a long time to come.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-mortal-kombat-1-community-is-working-together-to-try-to-figure-out-how-to-fight-floyd-but-the-exact-process-remains-a-mystery-for-now"><u>Mortal Kombat 1 enjoyed something of a resurgence in January with the secret fight with Floyd</u></a>, the pink ninja developer Boon had been teasing for years. That sparked a fun community-wide effort that breathed new life into the game. But that was a rare bright spot for what has, overall, been a disappointing release for many core Mortal Kombat fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What now for Mortal Kombat? Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated that it still believes the gory fighting game franchise has a future. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady"><u>the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which was Mortal Kombat</u></a>. Movie adaptation Mortal Kombat 2 is due out later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">While still at the beginning of this light-hearted life sim, I’m already hopelessly hooked.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot off the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palia-review">Palia</a>, a great life sim that just consumed dozens of hours of my life, I actually can’t believe I’ve been sucked into yet another one only a few days later. With its witty writing and seemingly endless supply of charm, Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time has already stolen plenty of mine. The characters and story so far are both wonderfully goofy and much more substantial than I’m used to seeing in this genre, the RPG-like Life system of leveling up various jobs is really easy to get lost in, and it seems to have nailed the balance between day-in-the-life cozy activities and more action-packed exploration to the point where it’s really hard to predict what might happen next. I’m still pretty early on in what’s starting to look like quite a lengthy adventure, but I’m already head over heels for this delightfully light-hearted romp filled with talking birds and time-traveling dragons. There go my weekend plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fantasy Life i is an interesting hodgepodge of chill game mechanics lovingly arranged into one killer mixtape that’s repeatedly surprised me thus far. One moment I’ll be mining for ore with a pickaxe to craft an iron ingot and think, “ah, okay. I get what this game is” – only to find myself walking through a time vortex moments later that leads to a prolonged open-world trek filled with combat against brightly colored monsters. Though that can be a little jarring at first, after a few hours I started to appreciate the way it keeps things fresh by enticing you to jump between its various attractions. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If I’m ever feeling a bit bored by helping villagers with their random requests, I can go run around a desert on the back of a camel in search of hidden treasure chests and fire-breathing lizards for a bit, or get myself chewed out by an entitled mimic. The thing that brings these disparate activities together is that they all have a low-impact vibe to them, one where I never felt the need to lean forward in my chair or worry about min-maxing my character’s loadout. It’s part life sim, part action-adventure RPG, all unified by its universally mellow tone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m especially surprised by how quickly I started to care about its cast of characters, too. That could be Edward, the adventure-seeking archaeologist, Trip, the talking bird who loves to sass humans, or Rem, the musically-inclined princess who seems to enjoy slumming it up with us common folk. The humorous dialogue and larger-than-life personalities have made me chuckle a lot more than I usually do from life sims, and I am quite interested to learn more about the time-skipping plot I’ve found myself in the middle of. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s impressive just how much this goofy life sim does.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s both surprising and impressive just how much this goofy life sim does, and how much of that is almost immediately super engaging. Of course, it’s totally possible that some of that charm will wear off as I become more familiar with its system and get further into the grind. It could be that Fantasy Life i just has an incredibly strong opening, but even if that does turn out to be the case, I’ve really been enjoying my time so far and am feeling pretty good at its chances of holding my attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m still early on in my adventure, and have yet to try out the multiplayer features (which include both online and local co-op for up to four people), get into the later stages with any of the job paths, or finish more than a few chapters in the story. After what will almost definitely be a sleepless weekend dominated by shanking wolves and helping a merchant bear heal his bee wounds, I’ll have much more to say – but for now I’ve gotta go help this cat with his personal problems.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Cozy Games</h3><p>If you're looking for a game that pairs well with a warm blanket and a hot cup of tea, look no further than these TieGuyTravis-approved recommendations.</p></div></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
