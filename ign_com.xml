But what could PlayStation have up its sleeves?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-everything-announced">Sony's last major State of Play broadcast, held back in September 2025</a>, finally treated fans to a good look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Marvel's Wolverine</a>, which is in development by the talented team behind the console's various Spider-Man titles: PlayStation studio Insomniac Games. Other games showcased included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/saros">Saros</a>, the next project from Returnal studio Housemarque, as well as third-party titles such as Battlefield 6 and Nioh 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company then held <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/state-of-play-japan-everything-announced-updating-live">a smaller-scale State of Play in November 2025 focused solely on Japanese titles</a>, and it was here we got a look at Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, Elden Ring Nightreign expansion The Forsaken Hollows, Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation fans will certainly be keen to see more of Wolverine and Saros, and potentially discover a release date for the former. We're also likely to see something of Bungie's long-delayed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, which will finally arrive on March 5 — less than a month away. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Saros September 2025 State of Play - Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Saros has already been dated for April 30, though currently all we know for certain of Wolverine's arrival is that he'll land in the second half of this year. (With GTA 6 due on November 16, it'll likely be earlier, and well clear of that.) Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-kind-of-fancy-lawyer-lingo-marvels-wolverine-developer-just-dropped-a-big-tease-for-another-hero-fans-believe">a tease from Insomniac Games hinted at Wolverine meeting Daredevil in the game</a>. And, of course, we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game-for-ps5-and-pc">just got a first look at multiplayer Horizon spin-off Hunters Gathering</a>. Perhaps we'll get more news on early play sessions?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Third-party games set for PS5 in the coming months include Capcom's Monster Hunter Stories 3 and Pragmata, which just got a showing in Nintendo's Partner Direct, Square Enix's climactic Life is Strange Reunion, Hitman developer IO Interactive's 007 First Light and Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight from Warner Bros. Games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The confirmation of a State of Play this week will mean that all three major platform holders will have held some form of announcement broadcast within the first six weeks of 2026 — though Nintendo fans still hope there is a dedicated first-party Nintendo Direct also waiting in the wings with more news on the company's own games (and perhaps a new 3D Mario). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, though, join us here on IGN for all of the news and reveals from this week's State of Play in just a few days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Over the course of 14 days, it "welcomes you into encounters that test your obedience, complicity, and restraint." The player experiences "the farm's unspeakable horrors through daily unique interactions," as they must "withstand 14 days of spiraling dread as the reality of the farm unfolds."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure"><u>Horses was first banned from Steam two years ago</u></a> after the team submitted an in-progress prototype. While some feedback was provided, Santa Ragione insists that no specifics were shared with the team at the time, nor was there an opportunity to appeal. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too"><u>It was banned again in December</u></a> due to its disturbing imagery, and while violent and sexual content is hardly new for either Steam or Epic, Santa Ragione took issue with what it deemed to be censorship, calling for "clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast-forward to this past weekend, and Santa Ragione posted a statement refuting Epic VP Steve Allison's comment that said "we love [its] studio," blasting the firm for "refus[ing] to provide details supporting their claims," and accusing Epic of making "provably incorrect statements about the game's content."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Epic made provably incorrect statements about the game’s content, refused to provide details supporting their claims, and has not shared their claimed AO IARC certificate, which normally includes a link for the developer to appeal," the studio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3mebdquhjts2k" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted</u></a> in response to an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-has-many-plans-for-its-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game File</u></a>. "They do not ‘love that studio’, they have effectively ghosted us."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The fact that the game does not deserve an AO rating is apparent from the widely available full walkthroughs on YouTube and Twitch, as well as from its distribution on the Humble Store."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games, however, has remained adamant that the game violated the Epic Games Store’s Content Guidelines. In a statement to IGN, Epic Games' senior communications manager, Brian Sharon, said: "Our team played the game and found it violated the Epic Games Store’s Content Guidelines, specifically the 'Inappropriate Content' and 'Hateful or Abusive Content' policies. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Horses Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We did a secondary check by filling out the ratings questionnaire for the game ourselves and the content got an Adults Only (AO) rating — which we do not allow on the Store. Because this wasn’t an official submission, we do not have a certificate to share with the team. We did give the developers context around the policies they violated. When they appealed, we reviewed the content again, and let them know the decision was appropriately applied and will remain in place."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the distribution issues, Horses has managed to sell over 18,000 copies. Though that's not enough for the publisher to fund a new game, it says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-sells-over-18k-copies-pays-back-loans-and-royalties-despite-removal-from-steam-and-epic"><u>it has been able to generate $65,000 in net revenue</u></a> by mid-December, which was enough to pay off loans and settle royalties owned to creator Andrea Lucco Borlera. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review">Our own reviewer</a> gave it a 7/10, calling it "an affecting first-person horror game that, despite some repetitive tasks and signposting issues, delivers a harrowing story you won’t forget in a hurry."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Prince of Persia creator Jordan Mechner has reacted to Ubisoft's cancelation of its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a>, which was scrapped last month seemingly within touching distance of launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Writing on his personal <a href="https://www.jordanmechner.com/en/latest-news/#winter-days" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a>, Mechner described the loss of any project as a "brutal experience" for developers — who have in some cases spent years of their life working on something that now will never see the light of day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While not discussing the Sands of Time Remake specifically, Mechner said the experience of having game canceled was particularly tough on those who had invested long hours into their work in the expectation their sacrifices would eventually be worth it, and for younger team members who had spent years on a game they can now no longer show off on their resumé, as their work remains unreleased.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"My sympathy goes to the development team in Montreal; I can only imagine how they must feel," Mechner wrote. "Having a project killed is a brutal experience. It's an aspect of the game industry that the public doesn't often see, but developers are all too familiar with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A cancelation so close to release can be particularly devastating for younger team members who don't have decades of past shipped titles on their resumé. It's tough to suddenly absorb that the past four years of hard work you were proud of, and looking forward to seeing out in the world as your new calling card, will now never see daylight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Words like loss and grieving might seem exaggerated," he concluded, "but artists put their hearts into their work. Memories of nights and weekends spent in studio crunch instead of at home with loved ones, sacrifices that felt worth it at the time, only add to the pain retrospectively once their object ceases to exist."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake First Look</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure">Ubisoft confirmed it had canned the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a> last month as part of a wider reorganization that featured layoffs at three development studios, the closure of two more, and the shutdown of five other game projects. A swathe of other, unnamed games were also delayed — reportedly including Ubisoft's unconfirmed but widely-expected Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For its part, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-needed-more-time-and-investment-than-we-could-responsibly-commit-5-years-after-it-was-first-due-to-launch">Ubisoft told Prince of Persia fans that despite six years of work, its Sands of Time remake was still too far away from being ready</a> to fund any further — despite the suggestion from other reporting that the game had been nearing release. "We weren't able to reach the level of quality you deserve," Ubisoft said in a statement to fans, "and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Subsequently, actress Eman Ayaz — who is widely-believed to have been playing the game's major role of Farah — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-cancelation-actress-says-shes-lost-3-years-of-work-and-found-out-via-the-internet">said she had "filmed marketing" as recently as November last year</a>, and had now lost three years' worth of work.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The actor behind the English language version of the newly revealed Overwatch hero, Anran, has responded to criticism of her visual design, supporting calls for her look to be changed, claiming, “this is a hill worth dying on.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-ditching-the-2-amid-launch-of-new-story-driven-era-with-10-new-heroes"><u>Overwatch spotlight saw the introduction of a new era</u></a> for Blizzard’s hero shooter, but, with it, came the reemergence of an issue that’s followed the design of its characters around for many years now: “Same Face Syndrome.” The look of Overwatch’s female heroes has long been a talking point among fans, some of whom have claimed that the characters all share remarkably similar facial features, no matter where that character is from in this universe. Indeed, fans have said this applies to Swedish shield-bearer Brigitte, Japanese healer Kiriko, and the Martian support, Juno. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with five new heroes joining the team imminently, fans say Blizzard is adding another familiar face to that list, in the shape of Anran, a fiery damage dealer from China. Having played with Anran quite a bit over the weekend, I can confirm she’s very fun to play as, but there’s no getting away from the fact that you could swap her face with almost any other female member of the roster, and not instantly notice a difference.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This has led to many members of the Overwatch community raising their concerns about the lack of variety in how Blizzard designs its female characters, and whether unrealistic beauty standards are being portrayed in a game with an otherwise positive message. It’s even something that's led the English voice actor for Anran, Fareeha, to weigh in with her thoughts on the backlash.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm the voice of Anran in Overwatch!!! 🧡</p><p>I held off on posting about this because I wanted to make sure I could do this discussion justice. Here's a shot at that! </p><p>Let's keep rooting for the version of her that could be. I hope you have so much fun playing her!! 🔥🪭 <a href="https://t.co/jbFbKHPVpb" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/jbFbKHPVpb</a></p></div>— Fareeha (@AskFareeha) <a href="https://twitter.com/AskFareeha/status/2020291256279089431?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 8, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m going to be so honest”, Fareeha said in a video posted on social media. “I’m nervous about this video, because I didn’t want to not address the elephant in the room, but I didn’t want to step on the devs’ toes or speak on their behalf because it’s a tightrope in my mind in trying to honor the community and everyone’s criticism, because I agree, and also give grace to the developers because they’re always trying their best in the situation they’re in.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anran had been teased as a playable hero in Overwatch for a short while before her release, after appearing in a comic and cinematic alongside her brother, Wuyang. But curiously, fans say she looked different in those earlier published looks, which begs the question why her face now appears to fit the more uniform Overwatch look in-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I got to mourn Anran, between the design that I had hoped for for her, and the design we ended up with," Fareeha continued. “Because I think in her comic and the cinematic, there was a precedent set by it. There was an unspoken promise that said ‘we’re going to challenge the beauty standards that are plaguing and ransacking media these days.’ Right? The Ozempic chic, the ‘contour your nose’, ‘you have no nose’, ‘the tiniest nose’. And I think because of that precedent, people feel understandably let down.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">rhinoplasty, eye lift, jaw shave, botox, cheek filler, facial bone surgery, gastric bypass surgery, face lift, lip filler, buccal fat removal <a href="https://t.co/f4OAgIquGg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/f4OAgIquGg</a></p>— Sasha 🔨 Torbjörn CEO (@torbillionare) <a href="https://twitter.com/torbillionare/status/2019165893243318438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 4, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Overwatch is a trailblazer at challenging that, right? Of trying to break those molds, of trying to explore the bounds of what it means to be good, what it looks like to be heroic. And I think the result we got says something else. It says something that leaves a bad taste in our mouths. It’s not the bold, optimistic swing that we know Overwatch to make. It’s a look that isn’t congruent with her personality, right?. She looks like the younger sibling. She looks more docile, somehow, as a fire hero, she looks more docile than the most docile peacekeeping support in the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since this new look was revealed, fans of the game have been taking to social media to present their redesigns and suggestions as to how to give Anran a different look, which is something Fareeha said she had seen, appreciated and encouraged.</p><p>This is a hill worth dying on.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’ve been seeing everyone’s redesigns, and quietly bookmarking them, but I wanted you to hear that this concern is important," Fareeha stated. “This is a hill worth dying on. It's worth speaking on, because I believe the more we speak up about the things that truly matter to us, the more we’ll see ourselves reflected in the world around us. The more we’ll see our values in the world around us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I want you to know that I shared all of this with the dev team. Not only that, I was encouraged to be as open and honest as possible and to not hold anything back. And, it’s my hope that this isn’t for naught, right? That they see it, they hear it from you all, too. While it’s not my decision to decide what can be done and what gets done about this, I will keep championing for the version of her that we all wished for, and I want you to do the same, with boldness, with kindness, and with ‘hopium’. Because Overwatch is not an exploration of what the world is, it’s an exploration of what the world could be.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I got chills looking at this omg <br>GORGEOUS ❤️‍🔥 <a href="https://t.co/omwie4G8gV" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/omwie4G8gV</a></p>— Fareeha (@AskFareeha) <a href="https://twitter.com/AskFareeha/status/2020610824696701142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 8, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Time will tell if Anran does receive an alteration to realign her look with what was originally conceived, or, indeed, if any future female heroes added to Overwatch’s roster manage to avoid the now-dreaded “same face syndrome”.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski has said that his scrapped <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/bioshock-the-movie">BioShock film adaptation</a> would have somehow included both of the original game's endings to mess with the audience's heads. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Verbinski was attached to make a movie version of the beloved game back in 2008 alongside Universal Studios, with a script in place from Gladiator and Skyfall scribe John Logan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, the project never materialized due to lengthy wrangling over its planned $200 million budget — deemed risky due to it also aiming for an adults-only R rating. Verbinski has previously said the movie came within eight weeks of shooting, before plans faltered. Work continued to try and get the film financed for several more years, though BioShock creator Ken Levine confirmed the project had been fully cancelled by 2013.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I loved this project when we were getting close to making it at Universal," Verbinski has said now, discussing the project in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1qwyvlg/hi_rmovies_im_gore_verbinski_director_of_good/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> Q&amp;A. "I was going to dive deeply into the Oedipal aspect and definitely keep it hard R with the Little Sisters, and the 'choices' the protagonist makes... and the consequences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I had worked out a way with writer John Logan to have both endings and I was looking forward to bringing that to the big screen and really f***ing with people's heads," he continued. "[We] had some great designs for the Big Daddies and the entire underwater demented art-deco aesthetic. Every year I hear something about the project, but I'm not sure any studio is quite willing to go where I was headed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> has two endings, based on the player's choices to either rescue or sacrifice the game's Little Sisters — and the two very different outcomes you get based on your level of mercy. The game's 'happy' ending — seen if you rescue every Little Sister — rewards the hero with a long life and the surviving sisters present on his eventual deathbed. However, if you harvest any Little Sister, your character is shown instead having influenced Rapture's citizens to believe that power is all that matters. An ominous final cutscene then shows what looks to be a nuclear submarine being taken over in an attack.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Concept Art Offers a Glimpse at the BioShock Movie That Could’ve Been</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The two endings are pretty different, then — a long and happy life or potential nuclear apocalypse — and it's unclear exactly how Verbinski's movie would have shown both. Could one have been a dream sequence, showing what might have been the alternative outcome? Or would the movie have presented audiences with two possible futures, and left viewers unclear as to which actually played out?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The later BioShock Infinite played on the multiverse theory ("there's always a lighthouse"!) but it's worth pointing out that this was still years away at the point of Verbinski being involved. Still, it's fun to ponder how an adaptation might treat the game's two endings now. Especially as plans to adapt BioShock have since resumed — with Netflix now involved in a potential adaptation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Netflix announced plans for a fresh adaptation back in 2022, though recent years have seen the project stall again, as cuts changed the scope of the movie, necessitating changes to its script. In September 2025, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-movie-is-definitely-based-on-the-first-game-as-script-work-continues-following-netflix-budget-cut">producer Roy Lee confirmed the project is still in active development</a>, with director Francis Lawrence on board to direct after finishing his work on the forthcoming The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a tricky adaptation, so there's lots of things to figure out and to get right," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-director-says-were-in-a-pretty-good-place-with-netflixs-tricky-movie-adaption">Lawrence told IGN previously</a>. "There's regime changes at Netflix, and so things stall out and get re-energized and stall out and get re-energized, and I think we're in a pretty good place, honestly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in the world of video games, 2K confirmed last summer that it had overhauled the similarly long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bioshock-next">BioShock 4</a>, which has been in development for the last decade. Amid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-studio-cloud-chamber-undergoes-layoffs-appoints-rod-fergusson-new-bioshock-head">layoffs and a further delay to the project's release</a>, former Gears of War head and Diablo franchise lead Rod Fergusson will now oversee the project. Fergusson will also head up the game's development studio Cloud Chamber, as it attempts to finally wrestle the project to release.
