They plan to be gaming the rest of their lives so decided it would "save a good bit of money."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A PS Plus Essential subscription cost $79.99 per year, so 24 years worth costs $1,919.76. Then, Sony was kind enough to offer the player an 89% discount to upgrade to a Premium subscription in a bizarre loophole, charging just $199.99 instead of $1,889.75, meaning it came to $2,119.75 altogether,</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Best PS Plus Games (Extra &amp; Premium Tiers)</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the reaction to On_Reddit_In_Class's post was a mixture of shock and awe, there is at least some logic behind the move, assuming PlayStation Plus remains a thing into the mid 21st century. Subscription service prices are on the rise, with everything from PS Plus to Xbox Game Pass and Netflix going up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-raises-price-of-playstation-plus-12-month-subscriptions-across-all-tiers">Sony last raised the price of PS Plus in September 2023</a>, from $59.99 to $79.99 for the most basic tier. "This price adjustment will enable us to continue bringing high-quality games and value-added benefits to your PlayStation Plus subscription service," it said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-defends-ps-plus-price-rises">Analysts said this was inevitable</a>, so another increase in the future isn't out of the question. Xbox Game Pass has seen a similar price rise, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-appears-to-be-getting-another-price-hike">doubling from $9.99 at its launch in 2017 to $19.99 now</a>. Buying a subscription ahead of time guarantees the price remains the same, however, so On_Reddit_In_Class may be on to something.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
