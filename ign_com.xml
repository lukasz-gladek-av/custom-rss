There’s a handcrafted MainGear rig that looks like it belongs in a design museum and crushes modern games, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon TCG</a> tin that leaves your pulls up to fate, and a Humble Bundle full of giant alien bugs and unapologetic chaos.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MainGear Custom RTX 5070 PC, Pokémon TCG, and a Skyrim Dragonborn Helmet</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Waiting on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders</a>?

Oh, and if you’ve ever wanted to cosplay as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Dovahkiin</a> desk ornament, the IGN Store has something special. I think it’s a solid haul; useful stuff, actual value, no sketchy third-party sellers in sight (Although Amazon is getting a bit cheeky with their Pokémon TCG mark-ups). Let’s break it down.</p><p id="maingear-north-rtx-5070"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MainGear North RTX 5070">MainGear North RTX 5070</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218237"><div id="218237" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MainGear North RTX 5070</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this is one of the smartest ways to get your hands on an RTX 5070 without building from scratch or skimping on quality. MAINGEAR’s setup skips all the common bottlenecks — no mismatched parts, no airflow nightmares, no “good enough” corners cut. For $2,095, you’re getting a clean combo of a Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, 16GB of DDR5 RGB RAM, and a 1TB NVMe SSD, all assembled by people who care about things like cable management. It’s future-ready, quiet, and fast enough to leave your current rig feeling like a potato in comparison.</p></div><p id="pokemon-tcg-azure-legends-tin-5-p"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin - 5 P">Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin - 5 Packs</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218238"><div id="218238" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin - 5 Packs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This tin is pure Pokémon chaos in the best way.

I want this SanDisk Express card purely for the ridiculous transfer speeds — up to 880MB/s read and 650MB/s write. It’s built for 4K video, gaming, and surviving every possible disaster short of lava, and it’ll likely outlive every other accessory in your bag.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-shining-fates-collectio"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collectio">Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218241"><div id="218241" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Shining Fates Pikachu V Box is a great grab if you’re chasing shiny cards or just really into oversized electric rodents.
