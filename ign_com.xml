Expect anti-cheat improvements from Season 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2.699GB patch (PS5) for the Call of Duty app, which must be downloaded whether you own Black Ops 6 or not, adds new Multiplayer and Zombies modes, the new High Roller Wildcard, and makes various balance changes to Scorestreaks. The patch notes in full are below.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/03/bo6-squid-game-001-1735919256595.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty's Squid Game crossover.

Get on the pitch in the Red Card stadium and play three rounds of Red Light, Green Light, each two minutes long. </li><li>In Round 1, no one gets a weapon. In Rounds 2 and 3, you can pick up weapons on the ground and eliminate other competitors with melee attacks and Finishing Moves. There’s just one simple rule: When Young-hee says “Green Light,” the fight is on. Move a muscle after she says “Red Light” and you’re toast.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Pentathlon (NEW)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Prove that you have what it takes in the long run by competing in a series of Multiplayer modes to find out who reigns supreme! Play Domination, Kill Confirmed, and Hardpoint along with two new mode variants: Piggy Bank Team Deathmatch and Roulette. <ul data-cy="list"><li>In Piggy Bank TDM, every elimination adds score to the Mega Piggy Bank; fight for possession of the huge payout when it drops part way through the match. </li><li>In Roulette, one-shot eliminations via the Roulette Handgun award double the points, though with each fired shot there’s a chance it’ll blow up in your hands!</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Squid Game Moshpit (NEW)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fire up the Squid Game Moshpit including Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Hardpoint with a twist as players gain access to three important Squid Game-themed features: <ul data-cy="list"><li>Red Light, Green Light Scorestreak: Is the fight getting too hectic for you? Stop the enemy in their tracks with this Scorestreak that calls “Red Light,” commanding all enemy players to stop moving or risk elimination. </li><li>Piggy Bank: Eliminated players have a chance of dropping a Piggy Bank that awards a small score boost when picked up. For a bigger payday, watch for the Mega Piggy Bank. Every elimination adds additional score to the Mega Piggy Bank, so once it drops, fight for it to acquire all the deposited score within. </li><li>Roulette Handgun: The epitome of high risk, high reward. The Roulette Handgun spawns in the center of the map; grab it to activate a permanent UAV effect while wielding it and land one-shot eliminations against enemies, earning more than double the normal score to help you obtain Scorestreaks more quickly. The catch? Your location will be marked for everyone to see, and every shot has a chance to blow up the weapon, taking you down with it.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Prop Hunt</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Improved spatial audio on Prop whistles.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Prop UI could remain present when switching rounds to the Hunter team.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Props could block doors from opening when locked in place.</li></ul></li></ul>Wildcards<ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>High Roller (NEW)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Allows players to equip up to four Scorestreaks.</li></ul></li></ul>Scorestreaks<ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>RC-XD</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Slightly reduced the RC-XD’s max damage. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Archangel Launcher</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed a rare issue where the next bullet fired from a weapon after using the Archangel Launcher could be an Archangel rocket.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Care Package</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Care Packages will now contain the Scout Pulse Scorestreak less frequently.</li></ul></li><li><strong>LDBR</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Decreased the damage the LDBR does to its owner.</li><li>Reduced score requirement from 950 to 800.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Sentry Turret</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Increased Sentry Turret fire rate.</li><li>Increased Sentry Turret HP.</li><li>Reduced score requirement from 1000 to 950.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Hellstorm</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced score requirement from 1050 to 1000.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Watchdog Helo</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Slightly increased the Watchdog Helo’s damage.</li><li>Increased Watchdog Helo accuracy when it acquires a new target.</li><li>Reduced score requirement from 1100 to 1050.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Strategic Bomber</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced score requirement from 1300 to 1100.</li></ul></li><li><strong>A.G.R.
