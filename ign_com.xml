            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop has sparked shock and anger among Warhammer 40,000 fans after it killed off two main characters from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a> via a brief lore update posted on its website.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-just-promoted-titus-from-space-marine-2-with-a-fancy-new-trailer-that-sets-up-the-next-narrative-expansion-for-warhammer-40000">Games Workshop announced that Titus, the main playable character from last year’s blockbuster hit video game Space Marine 2, had been promoted with a cool new trailer that set up the next narrative expansion for the Warhammer 40,000 setting</a>, dubbed 500 Worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Captain Demetrian Titus, Master of the Watch, is now once again Captain of the Ultramarines Second Company, a position he had already held before he was taken into custody on suspicion of heresy by the Inquisition after the events of the first Space Marine game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the context of Titus’ promotion, fans had expressed concern over the fate of Sevastus Acheran, the former captain of the Second Company and Master of the Watch who dishes out missions (and can never spare enough men) in Space Marine 2. Now we know what actually happened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a lore update post on <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/2uwxtd2k/500-worlds-how-did-titus-become-captain-of-the-second-company-again/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Community</a>, Games Workshop revealed what Acheran got up to following the events of Space Marine 2. And yes, as fans feared, he’s dead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Confirmation comes from a four paragraph lore explanation in the article itself, which reveals Acheran went out in a blaze of glory fighting a Genestealer Cult on the hive world of Trygg. That’s that. Acheran is dead. But it gets worse.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/11/40k-secondcoycaptains-nov11-image5-ntfnir5ucc-1762888578681.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sevastus Acheran is dead. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out Lieutenant Chairon, one of Titus’ squadmates from Space Marine 2 and who was conspicuous by his absence from Games Workshop’s Titus reveal, was by Acheran’s side and also died at the hands of the Genestealer Cult. Chairon doesn't even get more than a shout out, despite being the more prominent character in Space Marine 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s how it went down:</p><blockquote>Every last Space Marine that landed on Trygg was slowly worn down in a series of increasingly desperate battles. When Imperial reinforcements arrived to purge the last of the cult, they discovered that Acheran, Chairon, and the rest of their brothers had sold their lives to cull untold numbers of xenos hybrids.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say Warhammer 40,000 fans are a tad upset not just <em>by</em> the news of the characters’ deaths, but <em>how</em> Games Workshop revealed the news. Many are saying Acheran and Chairon deserved better than to be killed off-screen, and should instead have got their moment in either Space Marine 2 DLC or the confirmed Space Marine 3. At the very least, the characters could have been dealt with in a short story or, better still, a Warhammer 40,000 novel. But no. All they get is a few pars in a Warhammer Community article most fans won’t even read.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">F's in the chat for the GOAT Chairon (and Acheran too I guess) <a href="https://t.co/wY0C1ags0L" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/wY0C1ags0L</a></p>— Master of Machines 🚧 (@MachDominus) <a href="https://twitter.com/MachDominus/status/1988269547271414241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"They had so much options," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1oubpkp/comment/noanrqq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Fit_Fisherman_9840</a> on the Space Marine subreddit, which is currently up in arms. "Make Chairon the new LT, or since his hate for the traitor make him the company Judiciar. And Acheran? Make it a dreadnought for f*** sake."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What a bummer about Acheran and Chairon," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1oubixc/comment/noah3qc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said Thinsul over on the Warhammer 40,000 subreddit</a>. "Killing them both off screen, especially Chairon as a Primaris that was born during the Heresy, is really low. It should have happened in a DLC or maybe a animation."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"He died as he lived, unable to spare any more men," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/1oucaor/comment/noamd38/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beaker_person said</a> of Acheran's demise on the 40kLore subreddit. "Is there anything more grimdark than to die offscreen?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1oubixc/comment/noamax5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joked ChaoticMat</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And what does this all mean for the other Ultramarines in Space Marine 2? Are they dead, too? In particular, fans are wondering about Chaplain Leandros, who was not mentioned as being among the dead alongside Acheran and Chairon. Perhaps he’s still out there somewhere, casting an inquisitive eye on Titus as he tries desperately to reclaim Ultramar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this probably feeds into Space Marine 3 in some way, assuming the sequel picks up after the events of 500 Worlds or takes place during them. We know next to nothing about the game, but we can probably count poor Acheran and Chairon out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Nintendo "will never position themselves as a direct competitor to PlayStation."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aime has said he "scratched his head a little bit" after seeing the company's first line-up of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> software. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrsg5P9fcx4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a>, the ex-Nintendo veteran shared his thoughts on the company's handling of the Switch 2 this year, as well as Nintendo's position in the video game market overall compared to Microsoft and Sony.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussing the dominance of PlayStation, Fils-Aime, who left Nintendo in 2019, said he expected the company to continue to thrive alongside Nintendo as the latter would never position itself as a direct competitor. As for Xbox, Fils-Aime expressed surprise that Microsoft hadn't already released more games for Nintendo's new console.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/11/gettyimages-1384659694-1762881485957.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Reggie Fils-Aimé. Image credit: Samantha Burkardt/Getty Images for SXSW.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"From a business perspective, when I first saw that line-up, I scratched my head a little bit," Fils-Aime said of Nintendo's decision to fill Switch 2's first six months with Donkey Kong Bananza, Kirby's Air Riders, a new Hyrule Warriors game and two cross-gen titles: Metroid Prime 4 and Pokémon Legends: Z-A. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not a threadbare line-up by any means, but it lacks the big one-two punch of a new 3D Mario and Zelda that the Switch received during the same time period, alongside a breakout new franchise: Splatoon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Certainly, what I underestimated was the enhanced Nintendo Switch 1 content, which I think has been compelling," Fils-Aime continued. "The stuff that you get for free as part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, I think that has helped drive some of the momentum. And then certainly, [Donkey Kong] Bananza was a key driver for them."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fils-Aimé was more complementary about Switch 2's potential to act as a platform for the biggest third-party games, though said that Nintendo needed to ensure it was enabling other developers to take advantage of its hardware potential in the same way it did — squeezing enormous games like Tears of the Kingdom onto a tiny cartridge through intimate knowledge of the Switch's innards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But let's be clear," Fils-Aimé stated, "Nintendo, in my opinion, will never position themselves as a direct competitor to PlayStation. It's not in their DNA. It's not how they think about the business opportunity. However, would they welcome some of the latest core gamer-type of content, whether it's the latest Assassin’s Creed or Call of Duty, onto their platform? Absolutely. Do I think that there's a player base there for those games? Absolutely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The key, and this is something that the team there thinks about every day, is making sure that third-party developers have the tool sets so that they have the full capability to bring the best of their games onto Switch 2."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One company that has notably held back from going all-in on Switch 2 is Microsoft, which launched a couple of games on Switch 1 (including Grounded and Pentiment) but is yet to discuss any future plans for Nintendo's platform. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm surprised that Xbox has not yet fully embraced Switch 2 from a software perspective," Fils-Aimé noted. "Certainly some games could easily be ported over to Switch 2. And I'm surprised that we haven't seen more of that. I thought there would be much more, especially during this timeframe leading into the Holiday. All through the fall, I was fully expecting some dedicated announcement," he continued. "And I'm surprised it hasn’t happened." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After bringing Sea of Thieves and Hi-Fi Rush to PlayStation 5, Nintendo fans have been waiting patiently for Microsoft to confirm those games, and others, for Switch 2. There's also the small matter of Microsoft's previous pledge to launch Call of Duty on Nintendo hardware — though there's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-its-working-with-nintendo-to-get-call-of-duty-on-switch-but-will-black-ops-7-be-on-switch-2">no sign of that happening for this year's Black Ops 7</a>. Perhaps 2026 will finally see Microsoft make its intentions clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, Fils-Aimé said he had "enjoyed" playing his Switch 2 so far, though noted: "the company did not send me one for free."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Samantha Burkardt/Getty Images for SXSW.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Princess Zelda can also be seen in the background.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">🔥Do you realize who you're dealing with?<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LEGOTheLegendofZelda?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#LEGOTheLegendofZelda</a> <a href="https://t.co/NCl84ydZ3a" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/NCl84ydZ3a</a></p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988267657133687158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo of America's social media account accompanied the clip with the tease: "Do you realize who you're dealing with?" This is further confirmation of Ganon's appearance, as the dialogue is part of a longer quote from Ganon in Ocarina of Time: "Pathetic little fool! Do you realize who you're dealing with? I am Ganondorf! And soon, I will rule the world!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The clip concludes with the phrase "Build the Legend: Coming in 2026" — and that's all we have to go on for now. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A previous leak by <a href="https://www.brickfanatics.com/lego-legend-of-zelda-ganondorf-rumoured-2026/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrickFanatics</a> suggested the set will be a diorama featuring Ganon, Link and Zelda in their Ocarina of Time incarnations. Set for launch in March 2026, the box will reportedly include 1003 pieces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This should mean the new set will be priced lower than LEGO and Nintendo's initial Legend of Zelda offering: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-great-deku-tree">the 2500-piece Great Deku Tree</a> which launched in September 2024, priced $299.99. That set was especially large as it offered two builds in one: a version of the Deku Tree as seen in both Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2026 looks set to be a busy (and likely expensive) year for Nintendo and LEGO fans, as the companies' <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-confirms-pokmon-collaboration-set-for-2026">LEGO Pokémon range is also due to roll out</a> in the coming spring.
