It then plans to gobble up the remaining 20% of shares "after a certain period," Nintendo said, "once the subsidiary's operations have stabilized."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo does not typically trumpet the external development studios it partners with to work on its own franchises, but video game credits have shown that the Singapore-based outfit has contributed to 2022's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a>, and was the lead developer behind 2021's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/new-pokemon-snap">New Pokémon Snap</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reportedly, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/09/metroid-prime-4-reportedly-in-development-at-bandai-namco">the studio was also briefly tasked with working on Metroid Prime 4</a>, before Nintendo restarted development at Retro Studios. And more generally, Bandai Namco overall has enjoyed a close relationship with Nintendo in recent years, with other teams within the company working on Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and Pokkén Tournament.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's relatively unusual for Nintendo to acquire other developers, though recent years have seen the company acquire a steady stream of external teams it has built a history of collaboration with.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/27/screenshot-2025-11-27-124712-1764247783826.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nintendo Studios Singapore logo.

In February 2022, Nintendo bought long-time development partner SRD. And in late 2024, Nintendo upped its stake in Xenoblade and Zelda co-developer Monolith Soft, to now 100% own the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there's mo-cap and CGI specialist studio Dynamo Pictures, now re-named Nintendo Pictures, which Nintendo acquired in 2022.

While he didn't really think of Final Fantasy as "competition" per se — while they're both RPGs, their approaches to storytelling are quite different  — he did acknowledge that he was "definitely paying attention to it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Way back then, when Final Fantasy originally came out, I was definitely paying attention to it because it was something we needed to look out for," Horii said, reflecting on how the games differ. "But there's one key difference that I really saw back then: the protagonists in the Final Fantasy titles, they speak a lot. Whereas for Dragon Quest, the key objective for [the games], or the experience it offers for the player, is that the player becomes the protagonist themselves.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Final Fantasy Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"In Final Fantasy, you kind of observe the protagonist, but you're not necessarily becoming the protagonist in the games.
