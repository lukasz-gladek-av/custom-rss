"Management did not inform public about these steps either," Krúpa claimed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Ubisoft for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in October, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-04/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-consider-buyout-of-ubisoft?srnd=undefined" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg reported</a> that Ubisoft's founding Guillemot family and shareholder Tencent were in discussions to take the company private following a number of high-profile flops, game cancellations, and the collapse of the company's share price. At the time, the talks were merely exploratory, and Ubisoft told IGN it would "inform the market if and when appropriate."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For several years now, Ubisoft has seemed to be in a strange, slow downward spiral, with a number of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed">high-profile flops</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cuts-45-jobs-in-its-us-offices">layoffs</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">studio closures</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-delays-cancellations-were-because-it-was-making-too-many-games-at-once">game cancellations, and delay after delay after delay</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, rumors continue to spin about what exact proposals the board is considering, with some media outlets floating the idea that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-and-guillemot-brothers-ubisoft-buyout-reportedly-held-up-by-dispute-over-control" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tencent is increasingly reluctant to embrace Ubisoft</a> due to the Guillemot family's insistance on retaining a significant amount of control. Sans Tencent, there are few other companies big enough and rich enough to spend the cash needed to save the albatross Ubisoft has grown into.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Management postponed its current game (which should save the company and its financials) Assassin’s Creed first time on 18th of July 2024," Krúpa's statement said. "On that date, Ubisoft confirmed full-year guidance for the year and release of AC Shadows on November 15. 2024. Just [a] couple months later, in September 2024, Ubisoft delayed the game again and revised its guidance, which in our view, was [a] move that could have [been] predicted by Ubisoft management. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After [the] third delay, the game will finally be published on March 20, 2025. These delays and revised guidances caused severe stock declines, which harmed mostly retail investors that have limited resources to manage their positions accordingly. This action benefited mainly corporate and institutional investors who were on the buy side for distressed prices such as Credit Agricole, Goldman Sachs clients, Morgan Stanley, and others."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Believing management did not communicate with shareholders "appropriately," AJ Investments is calling on all investors "who are frustrated with the prolonged stagnation in Ubisoft's stock performance and the lack of decisive action from the management team" to join its protest in May.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are aware that Ubisoft’s management and CEO have initiated a financial review of potential strategic options, advised by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. We expect this review to yield results in the coming months,” said Juraj Krúpa, founder of AJ Investments. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That is why we are organizing this demonstration in May — to ensure they have time to reach a conclusion that genuinely increases shareholder value. If their conclusion effectively enhances shareholder value, we will call off the demonstration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“All shareholders/investors of Ubisoft deserve a company that maximizes value and operates with transparency and accountability,” Krúpa added. “Ubisoft has continued to underperform compared to its industry peers, and it is time for the company to listen to its shareholders. This demonstration will be a powerful statement from investors who believe in the company's potential but demand urgent change.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">AJ Investors said that it is prepared to "sue the company for misleading investors."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time this investor has called for the company to go private amid a shares slump following the disappointing release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws"><u>Star Wars Outlaws</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disgruntled-ubisoft-investor-calls-on-assassins-creed-maker-to-go-private-as-shares-slump"><u>AJ Investments issued a strongly worded open letter to Ubisoft’s board of directors</u></a>, including its CEO Yves Guillemot, as well as fellow investor Tencent, to express their dissatisfaction with the performance of the company and its current share price and urging the firm to change its leadership and consider a sale. It followed weeks of turmoil at Ubisoft, where the megacorp's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales"><u>share price plunged following the launch of Massive Entertainment’s Star Wars Outlaws</u></a>, which Ubisoft subsequently confirmed had performed below expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

It has seen multiple expansions and revisions since its original printing. Buying the game is also not entirely straightforward outside of the base deck and campaign, as there are multiple ways to build, curate, and personalize your experience. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's a swipe-able, all-in-one carousel of everything discussed in the article, for those who feel confident enough about their Arkham Horror: The Card Game knowleged to skip the blurbs. For everyone else, keep on reading.</p><p id="the-core-set"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Core Set">The Base Game</h2></p><div catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb" id="216560"><div id="216560" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The core set contains all you need to get started. It contains five pre-built investigator decks that let you dive into the first scenario: the Night of the Zealot campaign. This will give you a great, replayable taste of the Arkham Horror Card Game world. And if you like it, you have a huge selection of expansions to consider. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Arkham Horror Card Game Expansions </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Arkham Horror’s card game expansions are a bit different than the board game version. For the board games, expansion boxes include the full stories and scenarios as well as the new investigators to join in on the fun. The card game operates a bit differently. You can buy campaign expansions to add new stories to your game, and/or you can buy investigator expansions to add new characters. In other words, the new stories and new characters are sold separately. This might not be ideal for everyone, but it allows you to choose how much of an experience you want to invest in at a certain time, since you can play an expansion scenario without the newer investigators if you want to. </p></div><p id="the-dunwich-legacy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Dunwich Legacy"><strong>The Dunwich Legacy</strong></h2></p><div id="216561" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - The Dunwich Legacy Campaign Expansion</h3></p></div><div catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb" id="216563"><div id="216563" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - The Dunwich Legacy Investigator Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dunwich Legacy was the first expansion released. It’s meant to be a gentle step up from the base game, with a user-friendly set of scenarios. In it you search for lost investigators, which coincidentally seems to tie into how the entire card game franchise builds upon itself by adding new investigator sets in each expansion release.</p></div><p id="the-path-to-carcosa"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Path to Carcosa"><strong>The Path to Carcosa</strong></h2></p><div id="216566" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - The Path to Carcosa Campaign Expansion</h3></p></div><div catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb" id="216567"><div id="216567" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - The Path to Carcosa Investigator Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A theatre production comes to Arkham in this expansion. The added rules in this one are fairly user-friendly for new playersm but the expansion isn’t easy enough for vets to dismiss. If you have the older first edition of this expansion, you may still find the differences in this second edition engaging enough to warrant a purchase.</p></div><p id="the-forgotten-age"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Forgotten Age"><strong>The Forgotten Age</strong></h2></p><div id="216568" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - The Forgotten Age Campaign Expansion</h3></p></div><div catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb" id="216569"><div id="216569" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - The Forgotten Age Investigator Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This expansion has you explore the ruins of an Aztec city, with a mystery that threatens to unravel the fabric of time iteslf.

It’s also on its second edition version now.</p></div><p id="the-circle-undone"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Circle Undone"><strong>The Circle Undone</strong></h2></p><div id="216570" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - The Circle Undone Campaign Expansion</h3></p></div><div catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb" id="216571"><div id="216571" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - The Circle Undone Investigator Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This expansion has affectionately been called “the witches pack.” The new investigators introduced in this expansion have some powerful bonuses that are a delight to use. That's a relief, because the campaign is one of the tougher ones of all the expansions as well. If you plan to get this campaign, you should absolutely consider getting the investigators.</p></div><p id="the-edge-of-the-earth"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Edge of the Earth"><strong>The Edge of the Earth</strong></h2></p><div id="216572" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - Edge of The Earth Campaign Expansion</h3></p></div><div catalogid="42d3cfc0-2a33-4526-a7e7-e277d242fefb" id="216573"><div id="216573" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game - Edge of The Earth Investigator Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The antarctic tundra is a classic location for Lovecraftian horrors to reside.

There are five to choose from: <a href="https://zdcs.link/9240XM?object_uuid=ef08ecdd-50ae-4054-9e78-1f17874c4766&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B08GG1QDD5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Harvey Waters</u></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXMJk?object_uuid=ef08ecdd-50ae-4054-9e78-1f17874c4766&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B08D3KPVL9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Nathanial Cho</u></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7EZ6V?object_uuid=ef08ecdd-50ae-4054-9e78-1f17874c4766&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B08D3B6LR7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Jacqueline Fine</u></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOREM7?object_uuid=ef08ecdd-50ae-4054-9e78-1f17874c4766&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Winnifred Habbamock</u></a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpXJLD?object_uuid=ef08ecdd-50ae-4054-9e78-1f17874c4766&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B08D37QCYQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Stella Clark</u></a>. All of them are $16.99 but can be found cheaper and on sale from time to time.</p><p id="scenario-packs"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Scenario Packs"><strong>Scenario Packs</strong></h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also several standalone scenario packs available to purchase. These offer a smaller dose of action than the full expansions above. They cost $21.99 each. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qd70rZ?object_uuid=ef08ecdd-50ae-4054-9e78-1f17874c4766&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B07VYN2YVX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Murder at the Excelsior Hotel</u></a> has been regarded as one of their more entry-level scenarios, so if you’re looking for something smaller before committing to something bigger, like an expansion, you might want to check that one out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other scenario packs include<a href="https://zdcs.link/aM6yqq?object_uuid=ef08ecdd-50ae-4054-9e78-1f17874c4766&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0BHBX5PJ3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u> Fortune and Folly</u></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ2EyN?object_uuid=ef08ecdd-50ae-4054-9e78-1f17874c4766&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Machinations Through Time</u></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QV7KY7?object_uuid=ef08ecdd-50ae-4054-9e78-1f17874c4766&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B08MYYHRFK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>War of the Outer Gods</u></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aX2joR?object_uuid=ef08ecdd-50ae-4054-9e78-1f17874c4766&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Labyrinths of Lunacy</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbxRoA?object_uuid=ef08ecdd-50ae-4054-9e78-1f17874c4766&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B084BQHZ6W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>The Blob That Ate Everything</u></a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Return to Boxes</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Return to boxes are revamps and additions to select campaigns. They require the base campaign set to play them, and while they are a bonus, they are best suited for folks who are serious about Arkham Horror: The Card Game. They are considered to be luxury items, essentially. And some of them are not the easiest to get a hold of. In fact, when going to create this list, I found that some were discontinued or not easily found through sites like Amazon or even Asmodee itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Five return-to-boxes are currently available: <a href="https://zdcs.link/avXq1b?object_uuid=ef08ecdd-50ae-4054-9e78-1f17874c4766&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Night of the Zealot</u></a> (the campaign in the original starter box), Dunwich Legacy, Circle of Carcosa, Circle Undone, and Forgotten Age. Some enthusiasts say that Forgotten Age fixes some of the complexities in the original expansion. As you can see, when you click the name of Night of the Zealot, these are out of print, so collectors may find them difficult to come by.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Parallel Investigator Packs</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2020/5/5/beyond-our-dimension/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Parallel investigators</u></a> are alternate versions of investigators that have abilities different from those of their original counterparts, including enhanced abilities and stats. Like Return to Boxes, these are not as easily found at big retailers. Collectors will have to look around for them to get them. </p><p id="the-bottom-line"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Bottom Line"><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are a fan of Lovecraft mythos-themed games, Arkham Horror is a universe you’ll absolutely want to explore. One awesome thing about Arkham Horror: The Card Game is that you can play it as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo game</a>, as well as with friends. The universes and iterations of games make for lots of capacities for adventure, with seemingly endless replayability for several of them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, like the board games, the card games absolutely veer on the more difficult side. They have quite a bit of chance, which can drastically increase replayability as well as frustration. Setup and learning time can also take a few minutes. You’ll find that the card games are easier to set up than the board games, even without expansions, which makes the journey through less painful.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jennifer Stavros is a contributing freelancer for IGN, covering everything from comics, games, technology, and nerd culture.
