No markdowns, but honestly, just finding these in stock without a 50% markup is a win.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon US: Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Iron Valiant)</h2><div catalogid="311bd43a-0408-4d85-a904-50c6012d8dda" id="216917"><div id="216917" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Iron Valiant)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Paradox Rift has been a bit of a rollercoaster for players and collectors. It doesn’t have the usual Pikachu/Charizard hype machine, but what it <em>does</em> have are some of the most meta-relevant cards in recent sets and artwork that absolutely slaps. The pull rates? Not great. The chase cards? Expensive. The FOMO when Roaring Moon ex keeps dodging your packs? Very real.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon US: Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Roaring Moon)</h2></div><div catalogid="311bd43a-0408-4d85-a904-50c6012d8dda" id="216918"><div id="216918" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Roaring Moon)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Iron Valiant ETB comes with a full-art Iron Bundle promo and futuristic-themed sleeves, because nothing says "Pokémon" like a robot Delibird. If you’re a fan of the sci-fi aesthetic, this box is a great pickup. Just don’t expect Iron Bundle to replace anything in your deck unless you enjoy disappointment.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon UK: Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Iron Valiant)</h2></div><div catalogid="738405dd-7e39-45c3-8b6a-3ed6806236d5" id="216919"><div id="216919" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Iron Valiant)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Roaring Moon ETB is the headliner here. You get a Scream Tail promo, Roaring Moon-themed sleeves, and the best shot at pulling a Roaring Moon ex, assuming the universe doesn’t hate you. The Roaring Moon ETB has been the hardest to find at retail price, which is why I'm hyped to find this ETB in stock. If you want it, grab it before the resellers do.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon UK: Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Roaring Moon)</h2></div><div catalogid="738405dd-7e39-45c3-8b6a-3ed6806236d5" id="216920"><div id="216920" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift (Roaring Moon))</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Roaring Moon ex (Special Illustration Rare) is <em>the</em> card of the set, currently sitting at around $60 on the resale market. It’s one of the strongest attackers in the game right now, and the artwork is top-tier. If you pull this, congratulations!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Groudon (Illustration Rare) is another savage looking card, hovering around $100. This is one of those cards that just <em>looks</em> valuable. The lava and ominous sky everything a Groudon fan could ask for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Iron Valiant ex (Special Illustration Rare) is one of the more expensive Future Pokémon cards, going for $35. The neon, synthwave-style artwork is so cool, and its ability makes it a powerhouse in competitive play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>In this new frozen world, players follow in the footsteps of legendary Ark survivor Mei Yin, on a soul-searching quest deep into the chilling heart of darkness to find answers to long-buried secrets of Ark’s past.</blockquote><blockquote>Ark: Lost Colony will present survivors with thrilling new challenges as they become the hunted in a vast occupied city, and gain access to powerful new kinds of character abilities, unique gear, building systems, and phenomenally exotic tames.</blockquote><blockquote>Will Survivors be able to face down the demons lurking in Arat Prime, and connect Ark's past and future?</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In its note to press, Studio Wildcard said Ark: Lost Colony “directly connects” the storylines of Ark’s Extinction and Genesis expansions and leads into the events of Ark 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ark 2 is the Unreal Engine 5-powered sequel to the hugely successful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ark-survival-evolved"><u>Ark Survival Evolved</u></a>. It was first announced with a surprise Vin Diesel cameo at The Game Awards 2020, at the time with a 2022 release date, but it was later delayed into 2023. Then, earlier in 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ark-2-delayed-again-to-2024-but-a-next-gen-version-of-the-first-game-is-out-in-august"><u>Ark 2 was delayed again</u></a>, this time to late 2024 as an Xbox Series X and S console exclusive, day-one on Game Pass, and on PC via Steam and Windows.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As recently as December 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ark-2-still-on-track-for-late-2024-ceo-says">Studio Wildcard was still insisting Ark 2 was on track for a late 2024 release window</a>. Obviously that didn’t happen, sparking concern from fans. So this announcement, coming three months into 2025, will help reassure fans that Ark 2 is still in the works, although Studio Wildcard failed to provide an updated release window.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We do have firmer details for Ark: Lost Colony, however. Pre-orders kick off in June 2025, and all purchases immediately unlock exclusive Ark: Lost Colony preview gameplay content. A full release is set for November 2025, with Ark: Lost Colony priced at $29.99 for Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
