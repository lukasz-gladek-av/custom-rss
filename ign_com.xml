It normally runs in the $30 range, but Amazon currently has it <a href="https://zdcs.link/QV73Mg?object_uuid=34e68c00-b671-4171-b832-c4c21420886d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on sale for $12.99</a>, which is less than half price. That's quite a deal on a game that's worth a look.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Maps of Misterra on Sale for $12.99</h2><div catalogid="8d6eada7-04f8-4e1d-8a7e-221edc573a17" id="216791"><div id="216791" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Maps of Misterra</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In Maps of Misterra, players are cartographers, seeking to chart an unknown island. You’ll start with some end-game goals of what you think the island is supposed to look like, and initially you’ll place terrain tiles on a shared board trying to match that map. But exploration is a tricky business and you can be mistaken: other players can overwrite your placements with their own until someone takes an extra action to confirm that tile, fixing it in place. Terrain effects, such as being able to see further atop mountains, or travel further over steppe, lend extra weight to the strategy and flavor to the theme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The result of this clever, two-step, discover and confirm mechanic is a fascinating dynamic and interactive puzzle where your goals push and pull against those of other players, and the island takes shape around them. This also provides a real sense of revelation, of venturing into the unknown as every version of the island is different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you enjoy getting into the theme of a game, you can also have a great time loudly proclaiming that your suggestions are the absolute truth against the nonsense other players are trying to foist on the map. It’s fun as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a>, too, against an automated opponent so you still get the sense of playing against an active player. The slightly messy interaction might put off some players, but at this price it’s worth a look for its sheer oddness.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">See more cool board games</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance writer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

Prior to that in April, it announced it would be cancelling Project Dagger, which was supposed to be an action-adventure title in partnership with Take-Two interactive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That still leaves People Can Fly with eight total projects in the works that we know of, including the upcoming Gears of War: E-Day in partnership with The Coalition. We don't have a release date on that one yet, though the Square Enix partnership game, Project Gemini, was last known to be due out in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
