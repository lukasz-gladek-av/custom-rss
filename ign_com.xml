"You will no longer be able to play Resident Evil Re: Verse once service has officially ended," Capcom said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game will go down on all platforms, meaning PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X and S, and Steam. Resident Evil Re:Verse is available by purchasing the latest mainline entry, Resident Evil Village. No refunds for the game itself or its DLC were mentioned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Resident Evil Re:Verse was developed in celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Resident Evil series, and your overwhelming support for the game has far exceeded our expectations since the time of its release," Capcom said. "Now that we've reached a new turning point for the series, we feel that Resident Evil Re:Verse has served its original, celebratory purpose admirably.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are incredibly grateful for your warm support for Resident Evil Re:Verse, and we deeply apologize for bringing you this disappointing news."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game made little impact when it arrived in October 2022, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-reverse-review">earning just a 5/10 in IGN's review</a>. "There are some good ideas in Resident Evil Re:Verse, but balance issues, a lack of content, and aggressive monetization make it little more than a sometimes-fun curiosity," we said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

"Metal Gear Solid Delta seems more like a very shiny HD remaster than the elegant remake it could have been," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-the-first-preview">IGN said in our preview</a>. "It’s an admittedly beautiful nostalgia trip, but almost faithful to a fault."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editorial Producer who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.
