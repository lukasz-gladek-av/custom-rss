            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers"><u>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</u></a> has launched to 114,000+ concurrent players on Steam, making it one of the biggest launches for a non-FromSoftware Soulslike game yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's currently the eighth biggest game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam by concurrent player count</u></a>, smashing through the 100,000 concurrent player barrier and clocking up 114,132 players in the last 24 hours. By comparison, and according to data supplied by SteamDB, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lies-of-p"><u>Lies of P</u></a>'s highest concurrent peak is a little over 30,000 players, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen"><u>Lords of the Fallen</u></a> is 43,075 players, and <a href="https://v/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The First Berserker: Khazan</u></a> is just shy of 33,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concurrent players isn't the only metric we should use when measuring how successful a game is, of course, but it's a good starting point, even though it doesn't account for players on other platforms.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the launch-day success, however, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers originally released to 'overwhelming negative' user reviews on Steam but has since upgraded to 'mostly negative' as players report issues with "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198992555658/recommended/2277560/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>extremely awful performance</u></a>," a "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/wakeupneo/recommended/2277560/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>completely lifeless</u></a>" main character, and "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2277560/reviews/?browsefilter=toprated&amp;snr=1_5_100010_#scrollTop=5435.5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>clunky</u></a>" combat and gameplay. At the time of writing, just 21% of the 6,500+ reviews left on Steam are positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Wanted to give this game a good chance. I was excited for this. I had seen the mostly negative rating and checked the concerns and I can say now that as of this moment, they are correct," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2277560/reviews/?browsefilter=toprated&amp;snr=1_5_100010_#scrollTop=5435.5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a> one reviewer. "The game has some massive performance issues. I tried just playing because sometimes gameplay can more than make up for lacking in other areas. I was unfortunately not able to see much of the combat. I did fight the opening tutorial boss, I did fight through a few camps of enemies, and, at one point, during the boss fight, I was enjoying it and having fun. I was unable to experience more of that due to the overshadowing performance issues."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"UE5 games is [sic] a hit or miss when it comes to performance, and in this case it's a miss unfortunately (at least for my system)," added <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/onyotato/recommended/2277560/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another</u></a>. "This game needs a free demo for this exact reason."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not all bad, though. "I'm one of the lucky ones: the game runs fine on my machine. No crashes, no stutters, no slideshow combat," said a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198382696571/recommended/2277560/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>happier</u></a> reviewer. "And that makes one thing crystal clear — Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is being unfairly crucified by players with garbage PCs and zero optimization knowledge."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is a Soulslike action-RPG set in the land of Shu during the dark and tumultuous late Ming Dynasty. You play as a mysterious warrior afflicted by a horrific feather disease, who uncovers hidden secrets and battles supernatural enemies in an ancient empire teetering on the edge of collapse. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is yet another great Soulslike to add to the ever-increasing pile, featuring excellent combat, wonderful level design, an incredible skill tree, and fearsome bosses," IGN wrote in our  <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers review</a>, which returned an 8/10 score. "Just watch out for some steep difficulty dips and spikes, and a reliance on cheap-feeling 'gotcha!' ambushes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers released earlier today, July 24, 2025, for PS5, Xbox Series, and PC via Steam and Epic Games Store. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-picks-up-wuchang-fallen-feathers-for-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch"><u>Microsoft has also brought it to Game Pass day one</u></a> for those subscribed to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/xbox-game-pass"><u>Ultimate tier</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lollipop-chainsaw">Lollipop Chainsaw</a> is getting a sequel and anime spin-off, more than a decade after the original launched. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new video game is being developed by Dragami Games, successor to the original's Kadokawa Games, which launched remaster project <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lollipop-chainsaw-repop">Lollipop Chainsaw RePop</a> last year for PC and consoles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lollipop Chainsaw won over a cult audience back in 2012 for its cheerleader-starring undead-slicing hack-and-slash gameplay. Notably, the project was directed by No More Heroes' Suda51, and written at least in part by James Gunn. Yes, <em>that </em>James Gunn — long before his days making <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/superman-2025">Superman</a> and running the DCU, and still a couple of years before the first Guardians of the Galaxy.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's press release states that the franchise has so far shifted 1.5 million units, though the vast majority of these — at least 1.24 million — are sales for the original game, rather than its recent remaster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That remaster drew something of a mixed response, as it lacked the original game's licensed music soundtrack and arrived later than expected — after Dragami switched from its original plans to fully remake the game. This initial idea was ditched, purportedly after fans said they were keen to play a remastered version of Lollipop Chainsaw as close to the original as possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's announcement of a sequel again makes mention of a desire to develop a second game that was in line with fan wishes. There's also mention that "key staff members" who worked on the original game were back for the sequel, though no mention, as expected, of any involvement by Suda51. Or James Gunn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Under the strong partnership between Nada Holdings and Dragami Games, development is already underway on a brand-new Lollipop Chainsaw title that both preserves and builds upon the appeal of the original," today's announcement reads. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With a firm commitment to honoring the spirit of the original work, the development team includes key staff members who were involved in the previous title. The new project is also being developed with close attention to fan feedback."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement then concludes with this — an oddly-worded affirmation that the sequel will continue the "distinctive tone" of the original and not tone it down due to "DEI". Is this a reference to Suda51's most recent No More Heroes letting Travis Touchdown wear a "F**k Racism" hoodie, or something to do with James Gunn's Superman, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-gunns-superman-immigrant-comment-was-a-mistake-that-could-hurt-the-films-box-office-former-superman-actor-dean-cain-says">which seems to have upset Fox News</a>? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or, perhaps, it's simply a suggestion that fans of the original's skimpy cheerleader costumes won't leave empty-handed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As with the original, the new title aims to recreate a world rich in dark humor," the announcement concludes. "The development process will prioritize staying true to the distinctive tone and spirit of the original work, without imposing excessive creative restrictions in the name of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no word yet on when Lollipop Chainsaw 2 will launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/21-little-details-we-love-in-donkey-kong-bananza.1251882/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza is making us go bananas. From the developers behind Super Mario Odyssey comes the Nintendo Switch 2’s first, major 3D platformer, and we just can’t get enough of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the excellent platforming goodness and stunning visuals, Donkey Kong: Bananza is full of little details and easter eggs. This isn’t a huge surprise considering Nintendo is great at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/60-things-we-love-in-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom"><u>adding little flourishes that bring its games to life</u></a>. And thanks to everyone on staff currently playing Donkey Kong Bananza, we compiled a list of 21 lovely details we found in the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">1. There are dozens of bonus Challenge Courses hidden throughout Donkey Kong Bananza. Each Challenge Course features a different objective, but they all contain bonus Banandium Gems for DK to earn to unlock more power-ups. One Challenge Course found early on in the Hilltop Layer is called Nostalgia Country, which sends DK straight into a side-scrolling level reminiscent of the Jungle Hijinx level from the original Donkey Kong Country. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are four throwback challenge courses in total, each taking Donkey Kong away from his 3D platforming adventure and throwing him into a 2D Donkey Kong Country-style side-scroller. Can you find them all?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2. If you miss the old Donkey Kong Country games, or are someone who wants to maximize your platforming skills, then good news, because the roll jump is also back. This classic move utilizes the momentum of DK’s rolls to extend the distance of his jumps. This helpful skill returns in Donkey Kong Bananza and works identically to the original games. Roll off an edge by pressing ZL and then use the forward momentum to jump and increase the distance you’re able to cross.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">3. While DK can punch most anything in the game, trying to throw a punch at a friendly ape or NPC will instead lead him to give them a friendly high-five or a thumbs-up instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">4. The Freezer Layer is occupied by a bunch of friendly Zebras who end their sentences in “brah.” Because they’re<em> Ze-brahs</em>, get it?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/dkpromo3-1752740852728.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">5. You can unlock a spin move for DK if you collect enough Banandium Gems, which lets DK spin in place before a long jump. Rather than spin with him, Pauline will jump onto the twirling DK and run around him as if on a treadmill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">6. Not only can DK bust through solid objects, but he can also pick up chunks of the ground to use as makeshift weapons that he can either swing like a club or throw. But DK can also throw these chunks directly into barrels to launch them high into the air, in case you need to transport some ground chunks with you where you’re going.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">7. Also, if there’s an enemy in the barrel’s path, the chunk will launch straight at them and take them out.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">8. If you happen to be near a chair while idling, DK’s animation will change, and he’ll sit on the chair to rest. This is just a fun bonus animation and won’t heal DK’s health, however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">9. Just like Link in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, DK shivers when he’s too cold and sweats when he’s too hot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">10. Music is integral to Donkey Kong, and Bananza includes a lot of remixes of David Wise’s songs from Donkey Kong Country. Sleeping in a shelter, for example, will play a remix of the Donkey Kong Country main menu music.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/2025071617050500-c-1753089846712.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">11. Throughout Donkey Kong Bananza, there are hidden fossils that DK can collect and exchange for various clothing items and cosmetics. While the fossils might just seem like a fun collectible at first, they are, in fact, references to past Donkey Kong games. For example, one of the fossils DK can collect is a pig fossil, which is a reference to the checkpoint pigs from Retro Studio’s Donkey Kong Country Returns and Tropical Freeze.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">12. DK can purchase new clothes for himself and Pauline that offer additional bonuses, like reducing burn damage or doubling the amount of gold you earn. Towards the end of the game, Pauline will even unlock the Diva Dress. While the dress’s ability makes it so collectible music discs are twice as likely to appear after defeating an enemy, its design is identical to the red dress that an older Pauline wears in Super Mario Odyssey.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/14/donkey-kong-and-pauline-amiibo-photo-1752488456414.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">13. DK can also unlock a specially designed piece of clothing later on, called the Girded Britches. They not only reduce damage from thorns and spikes, but the design features the beams and ladders from the original Donkey Kong arcade game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">14. There are many different biomes in Donkey Kong Bananza, including some with large bodies of water, like in the Lagoon Layer. If you decide to hop into the water for a quick swim before getting out, DK will shake off the excess water from his fur. It’s very cute.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/03/dk-blog-1751550138869.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">15. Sometimes a biome’s ground is made of soil, but other times it can be made up of wood or even metal. While DK should be able to tear through most of these materials, each type of terrain has its own unique sound effect. Wood will chip away, while metal will have a specific “clang” to it when DK busts through.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/16/screenshot-4130-1752643380227.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">16. Early in the game, DK will meet a mysterious figure known only as Odd Rock. In order to free Odd Rock from her predicament, DK will whistle for her, and the tune he chooses is a perfect countermelody to the original Donkey Kong Country theme!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">17. Donkey Kong Bananza includes amiibo functionality as well, but in order to redeem your reward from scanning an amiibo onto your Switch 2, you’ll need to find a specific NPC. This NPC is named Collectone, whom you can find in the Resort Layer. You’ll recognize him because he’s standing on an amiibo base!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">18. While moving between the different layers in Donkey Kong Bananza is mostly seamless, there are still some loading screens you’ll encounter. Luckily, the loading screens feature cute illustrations of the different characters in the game, and different illustrations of new characters will begin to appear the further you get.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">19. A variety of shopkeepers appear in various layers throughout Donkey Kong Bananza. You’ll know who sells what because these gem-like shopkeepers will appear in the shape of whatever they’re selling. The clothes sellers, for instance, will take on the shape of a shirt.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/dkbananza-finalprev-blogroll-1751307467703.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">20. Aside from Cranky Kong, DK’s nephew Diddy Kong and his girlfriend Dixie Kong also appear in Donkey Kong Bananza as the managers of an underground race track, appropriately in the Racing Layer. When you first encounter them, Dixie Kong will tell DK how Candy Kong, DK’s girlfriend who first appeared in Donkey Kong Country, will be jealous that the three of them are hanging out without her.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">21. Speaking of the original game, Cranky Kong, the original Donkey Kong from the arcade game that was first released in 1981, even makes a reference to Mario. If you find Cranky in the Lagoon Layer, he’ll tell DK, “Back in my day, rivals had charisma. And overalls.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the little details we loved in Donkey Kong Bananza.
