It also addresses various reported issues for Vault Hunters including major balance tuning, loot systems, gear, and achievements — further refining late-game, mission flow, and overall player experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gearbox-confirms-the-big-borderlands-4-patch-that-will-finally-dull-the-infamous-crit-knife-is-now-set-to-launch-alongside-the-horrors-of-kairos-mini-event">Borderlands 4 players had been bracing themselves for this patch</a>, as it finally takes aim at what Gearbox called "unintended interactions." Chief among these were builds that revolved around what was dubbed the 'crit knife,' which caused so much damage players were able to one-shot bosses even on Borderlands 4's toughest difficulties.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We will monitor the community closely for feedback and respond after the changes have settled,” Gearbox said. “This measured approach to your input will provide a consistent and better experience. As a reminder, our primary goal with balance adjustments is to provide you the greatest number of viable builds.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The update launches alongside the free Horrors of Kairos Seasonal Mini-Event. From today, October 23 to November 6, players will experience “a terror-inducing blood rain during all world boss encounters, with the added chance to loot the all-new legendary ‘Murmur’ Tediore Assault Rifle and ‘Skully’ Order Grenade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The patch notes, courtesy of the <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Borderlands website</a>, are below:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Borderlands 4 Day 30 October 23 update patch notes:</h2><h2 data-cy="title1">Change List:</h2><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Horrors of Kairos!</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added support for the Horrors of Kairos!

This new change will still see Neutron Capture being one of the best (if not the best) damage scalars in the game, but the power level will be much more in line with our expectations. Additionally, since all damage from the Gun is converted into Radiation, it should have more scaling vectors for clever build crafters, and allow for meaningful boosts from Gun Damage.</em></li></ul></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cosmic Brilliance - Passive</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Flux Generator</strong> + <strong>Annihilation</strong> interaction updated so spawned grenades now scale correctly with character level</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Amon the Forgeknight</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Shield visuals adjusted for improved clarity in combat situations</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Trait - Forgeskill</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Adjusted interaction with Forge Master class mod so Forgeskill now respects its cooldown in multiplayer</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Onslaughter - Calamity</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Camera behavior stabilized when combining Onslaughter with Order Legendary Pistol <em>Noisy Cricket</em></li><li>Attack frequency of Rocket Punch is now consistent in multiplayer</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Balance Adjustments </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Seeing Red</strong> Duration restored no longer increases per point invested, and is now 4 seconds for all ranks.<ul data-cy="list"><li><em>Dev Note: Seeing Red was always meant to have huge damage scaling potential, but was always meant to be hard to maintain.
