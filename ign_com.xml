When Oblivion launched for PC and Xbox 360 more than 19 years ago, it was clear Tandilwe could use some speech training of her own. One of her voice lines is a recording of what has long been assumed to be mistakenly included audio of actress Linda Kenyon taking another stab at a line.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Begging Bethesda to keep this voice acting flub in Oblivion Remastered <a href="https://t.co/rzGymRMchw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/rzGymRMchw</a></p>— TheNCSmaster (@TheNCSmaster) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheNCSmaster/status/1914371675132506375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">As players began their trek through a revitalized Cyrodiil yesterday, many were on the hunt to see just how faithful the ground-up remaster truly was. While so many environments, character models, and items have been given a fresh coat of paint, others have been happy to find that many of the blemishes that made 2006 Oblivion so special remain intact. Tandilwe’s infamous (and hilarious) blooper is one moment fans have been <a href="https://x.com/ManyATrueNerd/status/1915072065222124017" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overjoyed to see return</a>.

The high frequency of Steam sales has usually been enough to tide me over on newer releases. So while I knew <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-xbox-game-pass-cost">Game Pass</a> was out there and did occasionally offer some big name games, there was never a moment where it felt like it would be worth it for me, personally. Well, until yesterday. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda and Virtuos <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-finally-revealed-in-first-look-gameplay-and-its-out-today">shadow-dropping</a> Oblivion Remastered straight onto Game Pass? A badly kept secret, but still an insane reveal. Tomorrow, the gaming subscription will get Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the stylish debut from Sandfall Interactive that takes inspiration from the JRPG greats. I have to admit, as a die-hard RPG fan: Microsoft, you finally got me. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Both Hit Game Pass This Week </strong></h2><div catalogid="40fca49d-caba-44af-a409-39bfc91958ad" id="218136"><div id="218136" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate – 1 Month Membership – Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Windows, Cloud Gaming Devices [Digital Code]</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered was revealed and released on PC, consoles, and Game Pass on April 22. Like most people, I spent most of the day downloading the game and most of the night basking in the music. Highlights from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-comments-on-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-changes-we-never-wanted-to-remake-it">borderline-remake</a> include new character models, combat interactions, and remastered VFX. And while they did enlist more than five new voice actors, it seems Virtuos kept the best of the original's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yes-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-still-has-all-the-bugs-glitches-and-memes-fans-know-and-love-from-20-years-ago">janky dialogue</a>. The base edition of the remaster launched at a price of $49.99, which includes both the original DLCs, with a deluxe edition available for $10 more. </p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is the long-awaited debut game from French studio Sandfall Interactive. Ahead of the game’s launch (12am PST tonight in the U.S.), it holds a 92 rating on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metacritic</a>, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">IGN’s 9/10 review</a> praising the story design and describing it "as a true modern throwback.” The game’s stylish UI reminds me of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">Persona series</a>, and early <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/clair-obscur-expedition-33-40-minutes-of-gameplay-4k-60fps-ultra-settings">gameplay footage</a> shows off one of the coolest turn-based combat systems I’ve ever seen. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-where-to-buy">base edition</a> is launching at the same price as the Bethesda remaster: $49.99. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Expedition 33 was marketed as the headline of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-spotlights-its-game-pass-april-2025-wave-2-rollout-including-clair-obscur-and-gta-5">April’s Game Pass lineup</a>, the surprise release of Oblivion Remastered has led to some concern of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-publisher-acknowledges-the-barbenheimer-energy-of-releasing-the-same-week-as-oblivion-remastered">"shadow"</a> over the indie game's release. That said, my perspective is that we're getting two incredible cakes, and Game Pass makes enjoying both a little easier on the wallet. Instead of spending $100 on two new games, I spent $20 on a Game Pass Ultimate subscription. Now the only question is when I'll touch grass again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plenty more of 2025's biggest games have recently made it onto the service, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-prince-review">Blue Prince</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-review">South of Midnight</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-review">Avowed</a>, which join mainstay classics like GTA V and, of course, the full spread of Call of Duty. It really does seem like there's something for everyone. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Game Pass Is a Ridiculously Good Deal Right Now </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Game Pass Ultimate starts at $19.99/month and gives you access to the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full Game Pass library</a> across console and PC as well as cloud gaming. The exclusive-to-PC Game Pass lowers that cost to $9.99/month. The Standard and Core subscription tiers are $14.99/month and $9.99/month, respectively, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-appears-to-be-getting-another-price-hike">don't include day one releases</a>. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-were-inevitable-analysts-say">last Game Pass price hike</a> was in July 2024, and with these types of game launches, I wouldn’t be surprised if those prices go up again some time this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there aren’t any live <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-game-pass-deals">Game Pass deals</a> right now, you can pick up <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5Y2L8?object_uuid=856f6e02-2560-4c5e-8b74-7c80a1807a86&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">three-month subscription</a> that might save you from any future price hikes.

It was also the best-selling game on Xbox in March, and second best-selling game on PlayStation and Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We reached out to Circana analyst Mat Piscatella for a bit more context on Assassin's Creed: Shadows' success. He told us that Shadows' launch was the third-biggest in franchise history in the U.S., following Assassin's Creed 3 and Assassin's Creed: Valhalla. "It's a great start, so now we'll have to see where it goes from here."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Ubisoft created a subsidiary company based on its Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six brands, with a €1.16 billion (approx. $1.25 billion) investment from Chinese megacorp Tencent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news came after Ubisoft announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-now-up-to-3-million-players-but-still-no-sales-figure-from-ubisoft">Assassin's Creed Shadows had passed the 3 million player mark</a>. Ubisoft suffered a number of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed"><u>high-profile flops</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cuts-45-jobs-in-its-us-offices"><u>layoffs</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled"><u>studio closures</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-delays-cancellations-were-because-it-was-making-too-many-games-at-once"><u>game cancellations</u></a> in the run up to Shadows' release, and there is enormous pressure on it to succeed after the company's share price hit an historic low.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other stats reported by Ubisoft were already revealed by IGN’s coverage of an internal email in which the company contextualized Shadows’ opening weekend performance, saying <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-compare-assassins-creed-shadows-launch-to-the-perfect-storm-valhalla-benefitted-from-ubisoft-internal-email-says-compare-it-to-origins-odyssey-and-mirage">it was better compared to Origins and Odyssey rather than the “perfect storm” 2020’s Valhalla launched into</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows saw the second highest day-one sales revenue in Assassin's Creed franchise history, behind only Valhalla, the biggest Ubisoft day-one ever on the PlayStation Store, and has seen over 40 million hours played so far.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">March was a big month for new releases, with seven of the top 20 games entering the charts for the first time, including WWE 2K24 (No.4), Split Fiction (No.5), Bleach: Rebirth of Souls (No.9), Xenoblade Chronicles X (No.17), and Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune &amp; Dunan Unification Wars (No.18). Hello Kitty Island Adventure also ranked No. 4 on Nintendo Switch specifically in its console debut, and free-to-play game FragPunk debuted at No.8 in the Top 10 Steam charts ranked by Monthly Active Users (MAUs).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In second place this month, just behind Assassin's Creed, was another debut title: MLB: The Show 25, which was also the best-selling game for the month on PlayStation. Its sales were 23% higher than its predecessor, MLB The Show 24, during the same debut month last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other games doing well in March included Fortnite, which led all games in MAUs on both Xbox and PlayStation, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which leapt from No.103 in February to No.10 in March on PlayStation specifically thanks to being added to PS+. Co-op horror game R.E.P.O. made a similar leap from No.93 in its debut month of February to No.1 in March on the Steam MAU charts, likely due to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/554398/repo-streamer-social-media-clips-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growing social media virality over time</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite all these exciting new releases doing pretty well for themselves, March was actually a bit of a low month for games as a whole. Overall games spending dropped 6% year-over-year to $4.7 billion, and content spending dropped 4% year-over-year to $4.2 billion, Circana reports. Non-mobile subscriptions and digital premium downloads on console were the only content areas showing growth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I asked Piscatella for context as to why content spend was down, and he pointed to mobile as the primary perpetrator. Mobile spending, per SensorTower's report, was down 6% year-over-year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Mobile being such a big component of content means that a dip there usually means the market dips. Console full game download spending was up this March. But declines in mobile and drops in PC full game spend and a drop in digital add on content spending meant overall content fell."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for hardware, spending was down 25% year-over-year to $286 million, the lowest March spending total since 2019 ($279 million). PlayStation 5 was the best-selling console of the month, but its sales were still down 26% year-over-year. Xbox took second place, down 9% year-over-year, and Switch sales were down 37% from last year, likely in anticipation of the impending successor, the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">March 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Assassin's Creed: Shadows (NEW)</li><li>MLB: The Show 25* (NEW)</li><li>Monster Hunter: Wilds</li><li>WWE 2K25 (NEW)</li><li>Split Ficton (NEW)</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>PGA Tour 2K25</li><li>NBA 2K25</li><li>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls (NEW)</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>EA Sports FC 25</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>Madden NFL 25</li><li>Elden Ring</li><li>Xenoblade Chronicles X* (NEW)</li><li>Suikoden I &amp; II Remaster: Gate Rune &amp; Dunan Unificaiton Wars (NEW)</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li><li>EA Sports College Football 25</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.
