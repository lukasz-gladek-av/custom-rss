            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">GameFly is running an <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xJP1?object_uuid=848aaa0c-ba68-4e83-981e-ef794d5afd9c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">impressive sale</a> right now on PS5 and Xbox Series X games, plus Blu-ray movies. It’s definitely worth checking out if you’re looking to save money on recent AAA games. You can get PS5 deals like Elden Ring Nightreign for $27.99 and Doom: The Dark Ages for $39.99. You’re not likely to find those kinds of discounts anywhere else for quite a while on new copies of those games, especially after Prime Day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The caveat is that all of the games are pre-played (more info on that below). You can shop the <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xJP1?object_uuid=848aaa0c-ba68-4e83-981e-ef794d5afd9c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">whole sale here</a>, or read on for our picks.</p><p id="shop-the-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Shop the sale">Save Up to 50% Off Pre-Played Games at GameFly </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign is a fun twist on the From Software formula perfected in the original Elden Ring. It turns the game into a three-player co-op roguelite. It might not be for everyone (see our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review">review</a> for details), but $27.99 makes it much more palatable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom: The Dark Ages may be available for Xbox players on Game Pass, but that doesn’t apply to PS5 owners. So this is a great way to play through it at significantly less than the new game MSRP. Check out our 9/10 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Doom: The Dark Ages review</a> for more info on that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also on sale are Civ 7, Monster Hunter Wilds, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and many more. You can even save cash on Blu-rays like Mickey 17 and Mufasa: The Lion King. Lots of savings to go around.</p><p id="should-you-buy-from-gamefly"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Should you buy from GameFly?">Is GameFly a Good Place to Buy Used Games?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything you buy from GameFly is “pre-played,” meaning it’s been sent out to GameFly customers. That said, everything GameFly sells in these sales is in good condition. It also comes with brand-new new cases and inserts where applicable. I’ve bought games in previous GameFly sales, and I never would’ve guessed they were used, aside from arriving without shrink wrap. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these games are also “100% guaranteed,” so if you have any problem with them, you can get a full refund. Buying pre-played games is a good way to pick up recent games at way cheaper than new pricing. And this sale knocks even more money off the pre-played discount, which is essentially stacking a deal on a deal. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon just reopened invite requests for the Nintendo Switch 2 with Mario Kart World Bundle at $499.99. Switch 2 upgrades the now-classic hybrid console with a larger 7.9-inch HDR touchscreen, 4K dock output, and GameChat voice and video chat. If you've been holding out for the newest Switch, now is a good time to request an invite before stock dries up again.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also grab the Pokémon TCG Scarlet and Violet Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box for $88.95, which is slightly below market value. It includes nine booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Team Rocket’s Wobbuffet, and plenty of extras like card sleeves, dice, and a collector’s box. I've got more deals comming your way too. Including the INIU 10,000mAh 45W Power Bank for $12, a 5-pack of six-foot USB-C charging cables for $6.99, the Superman 2025 Steelbook 4K Blu-ray, and TCL’s 55-inch QM6K Mini LED Smart TV for $449.99, $350 off its usual price. Let's get into it:</p><p id="destined-rivals-elite-trainer-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box">Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225212"><div id="225212" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst this ETB is out of stock currently on TCG Player, the current pricing on Amazon is a full dollar below market value. Granted, its above MSRP, but if you want this ETB sealed for your collection or to rip it open right now, this is the going rate.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Buy Japanese Pokémon Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-japan-black-bolt-and-white-flare-most-expensive">Japanese Pokémon TCG</a> booster boxes have far better odds at pulling chase cards, have far less bulk and are often half the price of English booster boxes. This also mean said chase cards are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-cards-2025">worth significantly less</a>, but Japanese cards are far easier to get perfect grades in given they're always busting out of booster packs in perfect condition. Want a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Pokémon card collection</a> on a budget? Go for Japanese cards.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Mega Evolution Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is it, the beggining of a new expansion for Pokémon TCG. Best Buy have gone live with their preorder allocation for Mega Evolutions today, which mean Target and Walmart won't be far behind. Here's all the links you need and good luck trainers!</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Price Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't believe I'm writing this, but Amazon has quite a bit of sealed Pokémon TCG product for under market value. Whilst that unfortunately means it's still way above MSRP, some of these sets are at the best prices they've been in the last month.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">This Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet and Violet base set prices have been shifting noticeably ahead of the final sets Black Bolt and White Flare, with Psychic-type Illustration Rares like Ralts 211/198 and Kirlia 212/198 each climbing 28 percent this month while Gardevoir ex 245/198 now sits at $54.99 after a 25 percent jump. Miraidon ex and Koraidon ex are both trending upward as well, holding value around $23.99 each. At the same time several cards are sliding down as Fidough 213/198 dropped 15 percent, Armarouge 203/198 is down 11 percent, and Pachirisu 208/198 fell 19 percent. The steepest dips hit Dondozo 207/198 and Starly 221/198, now around $9.99 each after dropping 30 percent and 37 percent respectively, reflecting a market that is narrowing in on long-term playability and collector interest.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Last Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As newer Pokémon TCG sets grab the spotlight, Paradox Rift is seeing its high-rarity SIR ex cards drop in value while several Illustration Rares quietly climb due to shifting collector interest and low inventory. Cards like Altaria ex, Gholdengo ex, and Steelix have dropped between 16% and 25%, while Illustration Rares including Morpeko, Plusle, Minun, Groudon, and Iron Valiant ex are climbing fast, with Morpeko leading at a 43% increase. This mirrors earlier trends where less flashy cards gain traction as availability tightens.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Edge of Eternities Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering’s next set, Edge of Eternities, officially launches August 1 with preorders now live on Amazon for bundles including Play Booster Boxes, Commander Decks, and Collector Booster Boxes. Blending Magic’s iconic gameplay with science fantasy themes such as flying space whales and alien races, Edge of Eternities introduces four new mechanics: Void, Warp, Station, and Lander Tokens. Fan-favorite tribes like Eldrazi and Slivers return alongside reprints of coveted Shock Lands. Wizards of the Coast is gradually revealing more details, with a full card gallery arriving July 18 and prerelease events happening July 25 through 31, so now is the time to lock in your preorder if you want first access.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Pricing Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a bit of a mixed back for Magic: The Gathering prices this week, so it's always worth double checking eBay before TCG Player and Amazon for a last minute bargain. Also, whoever thinks a Theros Beyond Death booster is worth north of $700 needs to have a word with themselves.</p><p id="nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-worl"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart Worl">Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225375"><div id="225375" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Invites available now on Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still struggling to get your hands on Nintendo Switch 2?

I grew up playing these games, so jumping back in with the ability to duel online and unlock classic cards feels pretty great. The save-anywhere feature makes it easy to squeeze in a match during a break and come back to it later. I also like that you can rewind or fast forward during duels which makes testing out new strategies a lot more flexible.</p></div><p id="superman-blu-ray-digital"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)">Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225245"><div id="225245" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I was hoping to grab the steelbook edition of Superman but it looks like that’s already sold out. The standard Blu-ray is still available though if you’re just looking to watch the movie without the collectible packaging. James Gunn delivers a Superman story that feels fresh while staying true to the character. There’s a solid balance of action, humor, and heart, and it sets a strong tone for what’s next in the DCU. If you’re into superhero movies that keep things grounded while still feeling big and cinematic, this one’s worth picking up.</p></div><p id="split-fiction-ps5"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Split Fiction (PS5)">Split Fiction (PS5)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225246"><div id="225246" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Split Fiction (PS5)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I grabbed Split Fiction on PS5 recently and it’s been a great pick for co-op sessions. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">We gave it a 9 out of 10</a> and after playing it I can see why. It focuses on split-screen teamwork where you and a partner have to sync your actions to clear each challenge. I really like how each level introduces new mechanics and switches between sci-fi and fantasy settings so it never feels repetitive. Mio and Zoe’s story adds some extra depth too since they do not get along at first but that dynamic makes the whole adventure feel more personal as things ramp up.</p></div><p id="apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-earbuds"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds">Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225247"><div id="225247" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">AirPods Pro 2 are one of those earbuds I keep noticing for their mix of sound quality and thoughtful features.

The active noise cancellation blocks out a lot of background noise while adaptive audio automatically adjusts based on your surroundings. You get four sizes of silicone tips for a customizable fit, and once those are set they stay comfortable even through longer listening sessions. The personalized spatial audio and hearing aid features add extra depth, giving them more flexibility than just a standard pair of wireless earbuds.</p></div><p id="dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-switc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switc">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225248"><div id="225248" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake</a> caught my attention for how it brings that classic RPG feel into a modern format. At $34.99, it’s a pretty big discount compared to the usual price, which makes it an easy pick if you’ve been waiting to try it. The HD-2D visuals really stand out with that mix of pixel art and depth that makes the world feel fresh but still familiar. Battles stick to the traditional turn-based system but with small updates like adjustable speed and auto-battle, so it doesn’t feel stuck in the past.
