            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new month, a new batch of arrivals on all your streaming subscriptions. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-disney-plus-cost">Disney+ getting price increases</a> on October 21, I'd recommend getting a lay of the land you’re paying for. In October, the streamer will be getting a standard spread of series from across its channels, as well as the third season of Star Wars: Visions and a new Disney villain-themed anime. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, we also expect some spooky season celebrations. Disney+ has introduced new “scare levels” to <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp4lrD?object_uuid=26e36c37-eb4c-4414-8907-38957c5d657d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">its Halloween Collection</a>. Scroll through picks on a scale from “A Little Fear” to “Completely Terrified." We'll likely see more announcements over the course of the month, with my bets on a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-the-fantastic-four-first-steps-streaming">streaming release for Fantastic Four: First Steps</a> and some surprise Halloween specials. In the meantime, here’s everything we know for sure will be added to Disney+ in October. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Everything Coming to Disney+ in October </h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Seasonal Highlight: College GameDay </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney+ will stream select episodes of ESPN’s College GameDay pre-game show throughout the month of October, specifically on Saturday mornings.

The upcoming season will return to the form of its first volume, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-visions-review">IGN’s review</a> described as “an action-packed jaunt through the Star Wars universe that puts a new spin on the well-worn franchise.” All nine episodes were produced by traditional Japanese anime studios like Trigger (Kill la Kill, Little Witch Academia) and Production I.G.

They did <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-plus-price-increase-hulu">the same thing last year</a>, so it seems like October is their go-to time of year to make the switch. The short story is most plans (including both standalone subscriptions <strong>and</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-disney-plus-deals">bundles</a>) are increasing by $2-$3, like the Disney+/Hulu bundle with ads going from $10.99/month to $12.99/month. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These price increases all go into effect on October 21, making October 20 your last chance to back out or stock up on subs at the lower price. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see the full breakdown of price increases <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/disney-plus/Disney_Plus_Plans_and_Pricing">here</a>. One of the only plans that isn’t affected is the new Disney+ bundle with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/espn-unlimited-subscription-plans-and-prices">ESPN Unlimited</a>, with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-plus-launches-new-espn-unlimited-bundle-special-offer-with-disney-plus-and-hulu">discount still available for new subscribers</a> until January. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Blythe (she/her) is an SEO Coordinator at IGN who, when she isn't following streaming news, spends way too much time in character customization screens and tracking down collectibles. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/whats-new-on-disney-plus-in-october-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The director of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> has said Western players are more likely to choose the game's first-person option, after growing up on a diet of PC first-person shooters such as Doom. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Japanese fans more accustomed to third-person console RPGs like Dragon Quest have tended to play Requiem's demo in third-person, director Akifumi Nakanishi told <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/250929d" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Denfaminicogamer</a>, in an interview translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiem-devs-notice-japanese-players-are-more-likely-to-play-in-third-person-westerners-in-first-person/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Requiem doesn't launch until next year, a demo version has been publicly available at both Gamescom in Germany and Tokyo Game Show over the past couple of months. After attending both shows and watching fans try the game for themselves, Nakanishi said he had spotted the difference in how most opted to play in each location, and suggested it was due to how audiences had played other games while growing up.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think those kinds of differences are significant," Nakanishi said, describing the popularity of shooters in the west, as opposed to console RPGs in Japan. However, this was now changing, he continued, citing the popularity of both Minecraft and Apex Legends among younger Japanese gamers today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After originating in third-person, the Resident Evil series switched to first-person gameplay for Resident Evil 7. But recent years have also seen the launch of various re-releases of previous third-person classics, such as 2023's celebrated Resident Evil 4 Remake. Requiem will be the first title to hand players full control over which perspective their prefer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After playing the Resident Evil Requiem demo myself at Gamescom, there's definitely something to be said for its first-person perspective, which is presented as the demo's default. In first-person, it's harder to tell how close behind you the game's unsettling new monster might be, something that ramps up the horror elements. That said, the view does give you a narrower field of vision for finding hidden objects and clues, which sometimes proved a little frustrating. In reality, it seems likely that most players will likely try a bit of both.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil: Requiem - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Public demos for Resident Evil Requiem are important, Nakanishi told IGN at Tokyo Game Show, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-devs-say-they-cant-tell-if-the-games-actually-scary-anymore">Capcom's development team has now made so many games in the series they are unable to tell what is truly scary or not</a>. And, back at Gamescom, I chatted with Nakanishi on a range of topics — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-resident-evil-requiem-interview-why-the-games-monster-got-supersized-why-its-probably-not-lisa-trevor-and-a-tease-for-areas-beyond-raccoon-city-just-dont-talk-about-leon">the game's supersized monster, Lisa Trevor, and Raccoon City!</a> — while avoiding the elephant in the room: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-developers-are-still-being-coy-about-leon-kennedy">the continued absence of Leon S.
