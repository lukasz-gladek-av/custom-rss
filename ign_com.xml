            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We're like, we should have thought of that."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom's upcoming new IP, Pragmata, features a main antagonist that's really a rogue AI on the moon making the life of a spaceman and his android buddy difficult. But as much as artificial intelligence is in the news lately, especially in gaming, the developers of Pragmata say they had absolutely no idea it would be such a hot topic when they started developing the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to me at Tokyo Game Show 2025, game director Cho Yonghee and producer Naoto Oyama tell me that the concept for Pragmata simply came from Yonghee thinking about the moon, and asking the team to brainstorm ideas for a game set on the moon. From there, developers pitched a "black and white world" on the moon, and the concept of the enemy being AI came later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But none of the team, they said, knew they were about to release a game about an enemy AI at a time when real-life AI was such a fraught subject.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We really couldn't predict that AI would be this big from where we started from what you see now, but now that we have AI become this huge thing in the real world, we see like, 'Oh, maybe we should have added this or that from what you see in the AI right now,'" Yonghee tells me. "So we are like, 'We should have thought of that.'" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the pair confirm that the real-world shifts around AI didn't impact the game's story or direction. By the time it became a hot topic, the direction was already set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have this sort of the idea of the AI in the game locked down very early in the development back when we released the concept trailer back a few years ago," Oyama says. "And so we had that as what you see in the game basically. And then we really couldn't predict that the AI would become this big right now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah," Yonghee adds. "So the real life AI's progression or development, it's been so fast that it's perhaps overtaken what do we have in the game right now. So what you see in the game might not look as amazing than what'd you compared to real life."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I laughed a bit at this and remarked that I didn't think we had Dianas running around in the real world just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We created to be in the near future, but the future has come closer," Oyama replies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah, just the word AI is getting a bit old right now," Yonghee says. "So maybe by the time that we reach the age or the time where Pragmata takes place, people are not using the word AI even anymore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We recently got another look at Pragmata at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-online-program-tgs-2025-everything-announced">Capcom's Online Program alongside TGS</a>, and we had a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-aims-to-break-the-rules-of-third-person-shooters-gamescom-2025">hands-on preview of the game at Gamescom earlier this year</a>. We also spoke with Oyama and Yonghee about early ideas for Pragmata, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmatas-early-concepts-for-diana-included-a-robot-animals-and-even-a-talking-dog">possibility that it might feature a talking dog</a>. Pragmata is out sometime next year.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/world-of-warcraft-midnight-%E2%80%93-the-first-hands-on-preview.1314109/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the intro cinematic for World of Warcraft: Midnight, Lady Liadrin of the blood elves was joined by a conspicuously anonymous group of reinforcements to defend the Sunwell against this and last expansion's big bad, Xal'atath. And it turns out there's a reason for their ambiguous appearance: it's us, the players. The first moments of the next chapter of the Worldsoul Saga, which I've played through a big chunk of on an alpha build, had me emerging at that precise moment to put a stop to this shadowy invasion. And the revamped elven kingdom of Quel'Thalas beyond was worth the abrupt summoning.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Clock Strikes</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you aren't caught up on the events of The War Within, Midnight is something WoW has never really tried before: a direct follow-up to a previous expansion, and the midpoint of a planned trilogy that tells a single, overarching story. And at the end of The War Within, the manipulative Xal'atath used us to knock out a godlike being called a Void Lord and slurped it up to power her favorite plot bauble, which has enabled her to launch a full-scale void invasion of Azeroth. To bring about her plans, she has to snuff out the Light itself, hence starting her invasion at the logical place, the Sunwell.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The design of the new void creatures is diverse and evocative, especially with the more powerful lieutenants, and they help sell the stakes of the invasion well. I won't spoil exactly how this intro section ends, but Blizzard has once again done a great job using the skybox to tell a story.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Eversong Woods one is one of my favorite zones since The Burning Crusade, and I was thrilled to come back and see it bigger, healed, and thriving.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I got a bit of a welcome breather once the immediate disaster was under control, though, as I was quickly shepherded into the new expansion hub of Silvermoon City. This was an awe-inspiring homecoming as someone who has followed the story of this elven kingdom since Warcraft 2 and would call myself kind of a Thalassaboo. The reimagined version is so much larger, richer, and more dense than the one that's been around since 2007. Quel'Thalas, and the adjoining troll kingdom of Zul'Aman, are also now fully, seamlessly connected to the Eastern Kingdoms, finally letting us fly across the entire continent without entering a different instance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where once the Dead Scar left by Arthas tore the city in half is now the Path of Dawn, a highway stretching all the way across the zone and through the capital. Only small remnants remain of the undead corruption and mana addiction that once plagued these lands. What were once the gloomy Ghostlands are now folded into the larger Eversong Woods zone, with the eternal light having returned to all but the furthest corners. It's been one of my favorite zones since The Burning Crusade, and I was thrilled to come back and see it bigger, healed, and thriving.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Summit of the World</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the city itself, most of the real estate is now a faction-neutral expansion hub with all of the vendors and services you'd expect. The Bazaar has been extended across the Path of Dawn to form a new city center, anchored by our command HQ in the war against Xal'atath – the imposing Sanctum of Light. What was once the Ruins of Silvermoon sub-area on the western side has been completely rebuilt with two lovely districts: Falconwing Square, new home of the Farstriders, and Thalassian University, a gleaming college of magic that's also the setting of one of the new delves. Murder Row, representing Silvermoon's shady back alleys, is also tweaked and now part of the faction neutral area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around a quarter of the city is still a Horde-only zone, taking up the remixed Path of the Elders, Royal Exchange, and Court of the Sun areas from old school Silvermoon. The old Farstrider Square has sort of been folded into the latter two, with the Exchange leading right up into the Court of the Sun, but there is also a new subdistrict on the Southeastern side called the Court of Blood, where all of the Blood Knight stuff has been relocated. The Sunfury Spire, center of the kingdom's government, is now a floating tower above the city that is also restricted to Horde only.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alliance players who enter these areas will get a 10-second grace period before all the guards become hostile like any other faction capital, but this aggro can be cleared instantly by re-entering a sanctuary area. Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with the balance of cross-faction to faction-specific areas, even if it feels like maybe we should be ready to bury the hatchet at this point. The tensions between the visiting Alliance and their Horde hosts play out in the opening hours of the story, which makes for an interesting political drama.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Blinded By the Light</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first conundrum we're sent to solve in Quel'Thalas is an odd and unexpected one, having just come from beating up a bunch of void baddies. It seems that the reignition of the Sunwell has also caused areas called Lightblooms to pop up, which have become overgrown with life and brightness. In fact, the entire zone looks a bit washed out, with an altered color balance that makes it feel like someone has turned a floodlight up too high. The ongoing story of WoW has long hinted that Light can be just as dangerous as Void if you have too much of it, and it seems like we might be dealing with both this expansion.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">World of Warcraft: Midnight Cinematic Images and First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This issue becomes even more dire in the first of Midnight's delves, Collegiate Calamity, which takes us inside Thalassian University where the Lightbloom has gotten out of control. Compared to The War Within's delves, it felt quite short, but I was playing it on a fairly low difficulty. On the other hand, it feels much more like a connected area, similar to a lot of WoW's best dungeons, as opposed to several War Within delves that were caves with no real sense of place. You can see the rest of Silvermoon in all its glory from the upper terrace, which really helps situate it as part of the world and the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Replacing the cheerful Brann Bronzebeard as your delve companion is the ruthless Valeera Sanguinar, a blood elf assassin who still dresses like every female video game character did in 2007. She's pulling it off, though. I like the new cape. I've only found a couple of her curios so far, so it's hard to say how she fights, but the tone is very different when you're running with a femme fatale edgelord instead of a happy-go-lucky explorer. The change of pace is kind of nice. I don't know if we'll be BFFs, but stranger things have happened.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">In Shadow I Serve</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">We haven't been able to play the new Haranir allied race yet, and Midnight isn't adding any new classes. But it does include a whole new spec for the Demon Hunter, the Devourer, using the Void to fuel its powers rather than demonic energies. Thematically, it's a very cool idea with a lot of grim reaper vibes and a rotation that encourages getting into melee for a bit, then getting some distance, and repeating that dance. If you've played a Red Mage in Final Fantasy XIV, it's kind of similar. The best part about Demon Hunters has always been how much their fighting style relies on movement, and that's still true here.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest feature coming in Midnight is definitely player housing, and I was thrilled to discover how powerful the tools for customizing my own little abode in Azeroth are.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for my trusty Marksmanship Hunter, it's hard to compare apples to apples when this is still an alpha and my character on the test server is hilariously undergeared compared to my retail main, but it doesn't feel vastly different, at least in single target. I did my best to recreate my talent build as close as possible to how it is on the live version, and the biggest thing I noticed was that cast time reduction for Aimed Shot is much harder to come by, which slows down the tempo of my rotation quite a bit. The Sentinel hero talents have also seen a significant rework, as have our main multitarget damage-dealing abilities. We'll put a pin, or an arrow, in that.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Homecoming</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest feature coming in Midnight is definitely player housing, and I was thrilled to discover how powerful the tools for customizing my own little abode in Azeroth are – from the floor plan, to the decor, to the walls and flooring. It seemed like adding multiple levels was a little bit buggy in this build, so I didn't get to mess with that much. But everything else works great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Horde neighborhood of Razorwind Shores is triumphant, with everything from a blooming desert to rocky bluffs to tropical islands to a rugged pine forest. I do think the Alliance might be getting the short end of the stick here, though. Their neighborhood of Founder's Point seems really one-note in comparison. It's mostly just a sweeping, green fairy tale forest with a couple areas featuring different kinds of trees, one being mildly spooky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's still a lot of the Midnight alpha for me to see. Try as I might, they wouldn't even let me into the mysterious realm of Zul'Aman! But having played it basically every waking hour since I got access, which was about 10 hours ago as I write this, I am certainly impressed with the new zones and the customization housing allows, and I'm excited to see where the story of the Worldsoul Saga goes next. World of Warcraft: Midnight is due out some time next year, but housing will be rolling out to anyone who owns the expansion in December.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-the-first-hands-on-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Welcome home, champion.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Over a year after its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-next-expansion-finally-adding-player-housing-after-years-of-requests-by-fans">announcement</a>, World of Warcraft's long-awaited housing feature is finally hitting prime time, and we now have a date. Early access for housing will start for players who pre-purchase the new expansion, Midnight, on December 2, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This news comes directly from Blizzard, who shared it with us alongside <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-the-first-hands-on-preview">an early alpha preview</a> of the game. During this preview, we actually got to mess around with the new housing system a bit: we explored some of the neighborhoods available to build houses in, moved some chairs and tables around, and dyed a couple of tablecloths.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though we haven't yet had enough time to fully explore the promised wide range of options available, we can confirm there's already a lot one can do to customize the housing space even fresh out of the housing tutorial. And while we didn't get to experiment with some of the more advanced features, in a presentation shown off by Blizzard yesterday, we got a look at how players can add rooms of all sorts of different shapes, tweak item placement at a very granular level, and even decorate the outsides of houses with fancy chimneys and towers, elaborate gardens, and exterior styles themed around humans, orcs, blood elves, or night elves. If we'd had access to the full array of available decor from the get-go, we probably never would have left our house in the alpha.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To start with, players can pick a spot for their house in one of a number of different themed spaces within their neighborhood. For Alliance players, that includes spaces such as a farm, an autumnal forest, a coastal plain, and right next to the local graveyard. For Horde players, options include areas themed after the red rocks of Durotar, the plains of Mulgore, an oasis, and more. Some houses are clustered close to others, while others are spread apart. And you can either join a public neighborhood with strangers, or a private one with members of your guild or in-game community. And all of this is cross-faction, though you do ultimately have to pick either the Alliance- or Horde-themed neighborhood and get locked into one style of architecture or the other. Each player can have two houses per Warband: one in an Alliance neighborhood, and one Horde.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">World of Warcraft: Midnight Cinematic Images and First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that is currently able to be explored by players with access to the game's alpha, so expect to see streamers, content creators, and us sharing more about housing in the coming weeks. But anyone who has pre-purchased World of Warcraft: Midnight will get access to this feature themselves on December 2, 2025, ahead of the actual expansion launch. We don't have a final release date for Midnight just yet, though it's expected in early 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Midnight, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-the-first-hands-on-preview">initial alpha preview impressions right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
