            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“It's downright horrible."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A number of high-profile video game developers have defended <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> amid an online backlash during the game’s launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The free-to-play “PvP raid shooter” was the big new game reveal at the end of last month’s The Game Awards, but developer Wildlight then went dark until the January 26 release date in a bid to channel the successful shadowdrop of Apex Legends back in 2019.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At launch, Highguard hit a peak of 97,249 concurrent users on Steam — a significant number for any new game launch on Valve’s platform — but at the same time Wildlight has had to contend with a “mostly negative” user review rating. Meanwhile, Steam concurrents have fallen, and Highguard has slipped out of the top 100 most-played games list on Valve's platform.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Chief among the criticisms from players is that the size of the map feels too big and empty for a 3v3 competitive shooter. You’re able to summon a mount to get about faster (the mounts are one aspect of Highguard that players seem to universally like), but some believe a 4v4, 5v5, or even 3v3v3 mode would have been a better fit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also complaints about the resource-gathering phase of each map, which involves what some are calling boring mining and loot farming. The gist here is there is too much downtime and a lack of excitement, although players seem to be enjoying the raid phase of each match, where combat is concentrated. There is also criticism of the design of the playable characters, Highguard’s art direction, and a lack of content — as well as performance problems particularly on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through it all is a feeling that Highguard perhaps suffered from being the “one more thing” reveal at The Game Awards, where it might have better managed expectations in a slot earlier in the show. Wildlight staff have indicated they originally planned a true Apex Legends-style shadowdrop for Highguard, but The Game Awards chief Geoff Keighley asked the team about featuring it at the end of the show. Keighley has subsequently suffered a backlash of his own, with some feeling Highguard’ position in The Game Awards’ running order overly hyped the game.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Opening X this morning! <a href="https://t.co/NQXGvOvjYL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/NQXGvOvjYL</a></p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/2016245348210245655?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 27, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, developers from the likes of Baldur’s Gate 3 studio Larian as well as Fortnite maker Epic have hit out at the discourse surrounding Highguard, and the internet’s capacity to “hate” on video games at launch. Developers like Cliff Bleszinski of Gears of War fame, Epic executive Mark Rein, and Larian boss Swen Vincke spoke up against, in particular, negativity from critics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t like people s****ing on things others have created,” Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016281728755576974" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. “Putting something out into the world makes you vulnerable, and that alone deserves respect, even if you dislike the creation. It’s easy to destroy things, it’s a lot harder to build them. The best critics understand this. Even when they’re being critical, they do their best not to be hurtful."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016287197490491396" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went on to suggest</a> a Metacritic-style scoring system for reviewers, based on how others evaluate their criticism. “I like to imagine it would encourage a bit more restraint,” he said. “The harsh words do real damage. You shouldn't have to grow callus on your soul just because you want  to publish something.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016292319658410345" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He continued</a>: “And yes — I get that if people are charging money, you want to know if it's good or not. But reviewers can just say — I didn't enjoy it or I don't think it's well made or I don't think it's worth the money they are charging. That's enough. No need to get personal for the sake of some likes.“</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016317086465749120" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a follow-up post</a>, Vincke added: “What I'm trying to say is that most creative souls are  sensitive souls and those sensitive souls are the ones that care the most. When they check out because they can't handle the vitriol, we all lose because what's left are those that don't care. The effect the words have on those sensitive souls may not be underestimated. You don't want them to lose their idealism and love of players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There's other ways of dealing with player exploitation. Not playing the games is probably the best one. You don't have to verbally hurt the people behind the game to express your disdain. If enough people stop playing the games that don't respect players, those in charge will get the message and change course soon. There's enough other games there.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Highguard Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cliff Bleszinski, whose own live service shooter LawBreakers was a commercial failure, leading to the closure of his studio, <a href="https://x.com/therealcliffyb/status/2016245017073877329" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked</a>: “When did it become trendy to hate on a new game? Been seeing it more and more in recent years. It's exhausting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s downright horrible,” Mark Rein, vice president and co-founder of Epic Games, <a href="https://x.com/MarkRein/status/2016346300367729008" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commented</a>. “Especially a FREE game from a new studio. Just so sad. This is a hobby for people, they should approach with joy not hatred.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reality is that Wildlight faces an uphill challenge turning online sentiment about its live service shooter around, and the studio will be particularly concerned by Highguard’s Steam user review rating, which remains ‘mostly negative.’ Currently, 37% of the 19,439 user reviews are positive; Wildlight plans to continue to update Highguard with various patches, and has announced its 2026 roadmap of content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Keighley <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2015906199527686220" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a> to one person on social media who asked if he had a financial stake in Highguard’s success. “lol absolutely not,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has dropped another <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds"><u>Monster Hunter Wilds</u></a> patch that aims to improve optimization for "Steam-specific processes" and address the game's long-standing PC issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After receiving user reports, our internal testing confirmed that CPU load could increase around the Support Desk at Base Camp or the Grand Hub," the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526492547790405650" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in the patch notes, below. "This is due to claimed content status check processes to notify the player if there is unclaimed content in the Support Desk, as indicated by an exclamation point (!)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The notes go on to confirm that this issue — which causes frames to drop only in the Base Camp and Grand Hub, depending upon if you have any "unclaimed content" — is "an unintended bug and will be resolved with this update."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds"><u>Monster Hunter Wilds</u></a> Title Update 4 — which ushered in a long list of gameplay and balance changes, as well as CPU/GPU improvements, load reduction, and the optimization of "PC-specific processes and addition of options and presets to reduce processing load" — arrived last month. Its development roadmap, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-sets-out-roadmap-to-improve-performance-on-pc-starting-with-title-update-4"><u>detailed in December</u></a>, hoped to address the myriad issues impacting the PC version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We'll follow this up in January with a PC-specific update with even more improvements, and are looking into further optimization for implementation in the February content update," the team explained at the time. "We're committed to making Monster Hunter Wilds a great experience for all players. Thank you for your patience and continued support."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/more-dlc-more-fps-monster-hunter-wilds-players-ask-capcom-for-answers-after-theory-suggests-a-backend-dlc-check-is-tanking-performance"><u>one player believed they had discovered that PC performance was dictated by the number of DLCs a user has</u></a>. As de_Tylmarande <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>explained it</u></a>: "More DLC = more FPS." The tech-savvy Reddit user uncovered what they believed was a “bug in the code they need to fix” and shared their findings with the Monster Hunter subreddit. Shortly after sharing their theory, the redditor updated the post to report that Capcom had "replied," and was "already looking into and it will be fixed." Which is where Patch 1.040.03.01 comes in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer now insists that "the number of DLCs you own does not affect" performance, but claimed content status check processes <em>does</em>. Applying the latest patch should, according to Capcom, resolve it, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To further improve stability and performance across all platforms, additional improvements will be implemented in the Ver. 1.0.41 update on February 18," it said.</p><span data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><div id="the-10-best-monster-hunter-games" data-cy="the-10-best-monster-hunter-games"><p><span><span><span><h3 data-cy="title3">The 10 Best Monster Hunter Games</h3><h3>The 10 Best Monster Hunter Games</h3></span></span><span></span></span></p></div></span><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don’t have a direct comparison of my old settings on old vs new patch yet, but I can now run full ultra settings at 1440p and it drops to 55fps at worst, usually more like 65-80 though," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1qp0ubt/comment/o25rsxk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> one player. "Comparable to what I was getting with balanced FSR and minor settings optimization before. So basically enough of an improvement that I get a free resolution upgrade. I’d say I’m happy with it, very acceptable smooth 120fps with framegen and it looks incredible at full res. And the high res texture pack is finally fixed. 7600x/7900xt."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Conversely, someone else <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1qp0ubt/comment/o25kor8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>: "Played for a bit. Framerate went from an avg of 45 to about 52 at 1080p with quality FSR with a mix of high, and medium settings. I played around a little more and moving most settings down didnt really impact things much IMO. I know some people are having a better experience, but the game still just doesn’t look good for the performance it’s asking. Hoping the other performance patch coming next month will help out further."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Cool, they are updating the game to address the issues people have expressed concerns about since launch, I'm sure there are several people out there who have been waiting for fixes before hopping back on, I wish I had waited [because] at this point I'm a bit jaded and reluctant to even hop back on," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1qp0ubt/comment/o25llm1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added</a> another player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the full patch notes, which you'll need to install if you wish to access DLC or online play:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Monster Hunter Wilds update 1.040.03.01 patch notes:</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Required Space</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Approx. 2.0 GB (With High Resolution Texture Pack: Approx. 31.0 GB total)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Note: Due to revisions to the High-Resolution Texture Pack, a re-download of approximately 31 GB will be required, resulting in an overall reduction of about 45 GB compared to the previous version.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Video Driver Version</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Please update to the following driver versions to ensure the most stable experience possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">– NVIDIA GeForce: 581.57 or newer</p><p data-cy="paragraph">– AMD Radeon: 25.9.1 or 25.9.2</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Note: Some issues have been identified with AMD Radeon drivers versions 25.10.2 and higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Note: This information is subject to change at any time due to factors such as NVIDIA and AMD support availability.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Major Additions and Changes</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Improved CPU/GPU processing specific to the Steam version.<ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced shader warming processes performed outside the shader compilation screen to lower CPU load.</li><li>Adjusted texture streaming to improve visual quality while reducing VRAM usage.</li><li>Adjusted the High Resolution Texture Pack to reduce VRAM usage and overall package size.</li></ul></li><li>Added a CPU tab to the Options menu, allowing players to adjust settings related to CPU load.</li><li>Added new categories to the graphics settings, along with new settings for existing options.</li><li>Adjusted graphic presets and added a confirmation window to automatically update your settings on first launch after updating.</li><li>Expanded the Volumetric Fog setting in the graphics options from two levels to five.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A collectible statue apparently due for release alongside the unannounced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> remake has popped up online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft is yet to make its Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake official, but the game's arrival has long been expected <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-confirms-multiple-assassins-creed-remakes-are-on-the-way">following a constant series of leaks</a>. Now, fans have seemingly gotten a first look at merchandise for the game, in the shape of a new statue designed by collectible maker Pure Arts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lavish design features Black Flag hero Edward Kenway sat on a treasure chest that's spilling gold coins, leaning back against his ship's wheel, a cutlass and pistol in each hand. The statue is then topped off by a large billowing flag featuring the game's logo: the Assassin's Creed sigil with a skull in the middle.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="fr" dir="ltr"><p>⚠️ LEAK BLACK FLAG REMAKE ?</p><p>Un gars sur Vinted vend une toute nouvelle figurine de Edward Kenway et prétend qu'elle sortirait cette année. </p><p>En sachant que le remake de Black Flag était censé sortir dans moins de 2 mois, serait-ce la figurine officielle du jeu ? <a href="https://t.co/ctVWiavA6c" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ctVWiavA6c</a></p></div>— j0nathan (@xj0nathan) <a href="https://twitter.com/xj0nathan/status/2016167642046849488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 27, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">If Ubisoft has made any change to Kenway's character design for its remake, there's no evidence of it here. That said, any alteration to the now-iconic pirate assassin's look would have been a surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What is curious, though, is how this statue has seemingly come to light. Unboxed and with no mention of its origins, the item was reportedly listed via used clothing resale app Vinted. Numerous fans spotted the item pop up, including notorious Assassin's Creed leaker <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/2016167642046849488" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">j0nathon</a>, who quickly realized this was not a statue that had been publicly released already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The item's listing states that it is 35cm tall and features a 20cm width, and due for release in 2026. A detailed close-up of the statue's base shows logos for Ubisoft and Pure Arts, with a copyright mark registered for 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-swirl-as-collectible-maker-admits-there-is-something-going-on">Pure Arts hinted it had something in the works for Black Flag</a>, and suggested this would surface in the not-too-distant future as "there is something going on." Reports detailing the remake have  since suggested that the game has gone through substantial changes to modernize its visuals and gear system in line with more recent franchise instalments. Another report has also claimed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stop-removing-the-modern-day-assassins-creed-fans-react-as-black-flag-remake-reportedly-cuts-everything-outside-the-animus">the game will also no longer feature any content outside the Animus</a>, with extra pirate missions added instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most notable confirmation of the project came from Edward Kenway's own voice actor, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-edward-kenway-actor-alleges-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-for-hinting-at-black-flag-remake">initially teased the project</a> before later suggesting he'd been told by Ubisoft in no uncertain terms to stop talking. Finally, last month, the game popped up on the PEGI European ratings board website revealing what looks to be its final title: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft itself previously said it would release an unannounced game before the end of its current financial year on March 31, though this launch has now been delayed into the coming financial year (ending March 31, 2027) due to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure">company's major recent reshuffle of teams, projects and studios</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
