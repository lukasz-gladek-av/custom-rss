Alton told Game Developer that he takes no issue with Activision’s actions with Peck, but expressed concern “for my brand as a performer.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fans of the game have reached out to me because the lack of crediting [of the replacement actor] implies that it may still be me which unfairly represents my abilities as a performer," Alton said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">SAG-AFTRA’s dispute with the video game industry revolves around the use of generative AI to replicate voice actor performances.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/thieves-allegedly-steal-315000-worth-of-pokmon-and-other-trading-cards-in-targeted-attack<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Company owned by YouTuber Randolph.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Thieves have allegedly stolen more than $315,000 worth of Pokémon and other trading cards from UK-based grading company Ace Grading, owned by YouTuber Randolph.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ace Grading released a <a href="https://support.acegrading.com/hc/en-us/articles/23792474305437-Official-Statement-Please-Read" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> saying it was the victim of "a calculated and targeted attack" that saw more than £250,000 worth of cards (around $315,839) taken from its premises in Banbury, England. Thames Valley Police has confirmed it is investigating the robbery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While crimes targeting Pokémon and other trading cards are surprisingly common, this one has particular weight to it given Ace Grading is a grading company and not just a vendor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These companies receive cards from collectors and grade them out of 10 to add value and authenticity, meaning every card taken wasn't strictly the property of Ace Grading but instead the property of hundreds of card game players and collectors around the country.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those affected have already received an email from Ace Grading, it said, along with instructions on claiming compensation. "We have already determined appropriate compensation amounts, and this will be issued without delay," it added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some trading cards do hold incredible value, with price tags of hundreds of dollars fairly common and some rising to thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even millions of dollars. While collectors will receive compensation back, it will likely be no real replacement for the cards themselves which can be incredibly rare and difficult to find replacements for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The issue of increasing value is also a consideration, as grading cards, as mentioned, is a way to ensure their authenticity and increase their value, something that will only go up as time goes on. A card worth $1,000 today may be worth $2,000 in five years, for example, so a cash value replacement for its current value likely won't appease many of those who submitted their cards for grading.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ace Grading said it has "implemented additional, robust security measures to further protect [collectors'] property and maintain the integrity of our facility. We take these matters extremely seriously and remain committed to the trust that you have placed in us."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trading cards have long been the target of thefts given their high value, but high profile sales such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forget-the-one-ring-a-magic-the-gathering-card-just-sold-for-3-million">a Magic: The Gathering Card selling for $3 million</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/logan-paul-wears-most-expensive-pokemon-card-to-wrestlemania">a Pokémon card selling for more than $5 million</a> have seemingly spurred more and more criminals to pursue them in recent years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-and-other-trading-cards-targets-of-unprecedent-number-of-robberies-in-japan">The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department noted this increase in 2022</a>, saying it had seen an unprecedented number of crimes targeting Pokémon and other trading cards in the latter half of that year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are myriad high profile examples to point to too. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thousands-dollars-pokmon-merch-reportedly-stolen-after-thief-breaks-through-a-store-wall">A gaming store in Minnesota saw $250,000 worth of product stolen</a> after thieves broke through its wall, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stolen-gen-con-products-worth-300000-confirmed-to-be-magic-the-gathering-cards">$300,000 worth of Magic: The Gathering cards were stolen</a> from North America's largest board game convention in Indiana, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thieves-caught-on-camera-stealing-35000-pokmon-cards-get-mocked-by-store-staff">a total of 35,000 individual Pokémon cards were stolen</a> from a collectibles store in California.

However, he says Sega has been improperly claiming it is the actual owner of the song and behaving as such, including licensing the song to "at least 25 video games, television shows, live performances/events, and films."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Gioeli's suit claims that Sega is basing its ownership of Live and Learn off "a 2001 lyric agreement where Gioeli was paid $3000 to write lyrics for a as-yet-untitled song that would be included in Sonic Adventure 2." He did so at his home studio, using his own equipment and own vocals, allegedly without Sega's direct involvement. He did work with Sega composer Jun Senoue over the phone, with Senoue initially sending him a music demo that Gioeli was supposed to write lyrics for. But the suit claims that the scope of Gioeli's work expanded over the course of his work on Live and Learn without amendment to the initial agreement, which was only for the lyrics. Allegedly, Gioeli revised the song significantly, communicating changes over the phone to Senoue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, Gioeli says Sega claims it owns both the recording and musical composition, but argues this is not actually the case and that there is no agreement stating such. And Gioeli also claims that Sega has acknowledged in the past that the composition is "likely jointly owned", with one Sega lawyer allegedly telling Gioeli at one point that he is entitled to 50% of profits from its use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gioeli allegedly was somehow unaware that Sega has been using Live and Learn with regularity in a number of other formats over the last 20 years. This is despite Gioeli working closely with the company on a number of songs throughout this time, all of which had far more specific agreements signed about who owned what. Per the suit, he only found out about its myriad uses through a fan telling him, and has since identified 25 video games it exists in. These include multiple Yakuza and Sonic games, Super Smash Bros, Phantasy Star Online, the maimai series, and Monster Hunter Rise). Notably, Gioeli <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-3-will-feature-sonic-adventure-2s-beloved-song-live-and-learn-band-confirms">was involved in the song's inclusion in the recent movie Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> (which we've <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-ben-schwartz-james-marsden-idris-elba">just reviewed</a>), and even signed the deal with Paramount for song placement. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gioeli is seeking a court decision as to the ownership of Live and Learn, as well as a restitution for any money he is owed and damages for breach of the 2001 Lyric Agreement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

High on the surprise release of their highly acclaimed 2023 hit Hi-Fi Rush, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1734595482633524&amp;usg=AOvVaw3eYxpmlBQUvMj2RthQ0_EN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the studio was suddenly closed down in May</a>, causing uproar among game fans around the world. Then, in August, it was announced that South Korea’s PUBG publisher <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-ip-and-tango-gameworks-acquired-by-krafton-from-xbox-studio-will-no-longer-be-shut-down">Krafton had reached an agreement to acquire Tango</a>, along with Hi-Fi Rush, granting the studio a new lease of life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid such dramatic twists and turns, Tango has retained many of its staff for this new iteration. IGN spoke with studio head Colin Mack, creative director / Hi-Fi Rush director John Johanas, and development director / Hi-Fi Rush project manager Kazuaki Egashira about their plans for Tango Gameworks going forward.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/hfr1-1734592108151.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hi-Fi Rush director John Johanas. Photo by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-2-dev-wants-it-to-have-a-more-open-world-type-of-experience-new-owner-says">previous reports</a> that Hi-Fi Rush 2 is in development, Mack clarified that the team are still considering their options before they commit to a sequel. That is to say, the team had previously been working on a sequel at the time of the acquisition, and it seems pretty likely that they will continue to do so, but at this stage a sequel is not guaranteed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are considering a sequel positively,” Mack told IGN. “We are not yet at the stage where we can say specifically, ‘This is what we're going to do.' ”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Johanas added: “Many of our staff have a lot of love for [Hi-Fi Rush], so we feel like we have options. We’re currently at the stage of considering various opportunities.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Not only the game but also the characters and the world are beloved by us, so I want to cherish this IP.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From The Evil Within to Ghostwire: Tokyo and finally Hi-Fi Rush, Tango Gameworks is known for creating brand new games, and it seems that this culture still persists in the studio’s latest incarnation under Krafton. Egashira explained that creating new experiences is “in the DNA of Tango Gameworks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hi-Fi Rush became popular as a new IP, but if Hi-Fi Rush were to stay the same forever, it would eventually become outdated,” he said. “I think Tango Gameworks is about taking on new challenges. I hope to continue to work in a way that puts developers at the center, without losing our passion.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Not only me, but many of the development staff have a strong attachment to Hi-Fi Rush,” said Johanas. “Not only the game but also the characters and the world are beloved by us, so I want to cherish this IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“On the other hand, it's important to try new things. I worked on The Evil Within, directed its DLC, and then directed the sequel The Evil Within 2. I don't think I could have made yet another horror game at that point, because there’s only so much you can do with the same material. It’s risky to try something completely different, sure — but I think a sequel to a series is also a risk in itself.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Krafton’s acquisition of Tango Gameworks came about when the studio members, faced with imminent closure, began looking for a buyer. Krafton was proactive in courting the team and moved extremely quickly to propose and finalize the acquisition, allowing many of the staff to stay together. “I’m glad that we were able to continue making games together while keeping the DNA of Tango Gameworks intact, rather than starting from scratch again,” said Johanas, highlighting how the team’s chemistry was built up over years of working together, and played a big part in the success of Hi-Fi Rush.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio currently has around 50 employees, and Mack says they will begin recruitment in late December or January 2025, with a view to growing to around 100 people. This will allow them to focus on making one game at a time while also experimenting with new projects on the side, much like how Hi-Fi Rush was initially created.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Johanas also recalled advice given to him by Shinji Mikami, the legendary developer who founded Tango Gameworks in 2010 before leaving in 2023 after the release of Hi-Fi Rush. Mikami was keen to foster new talent at Tango, and Johanas essentially became one of his apprentices, influencing his views on how the studio will continue into the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I learned from Mr Mikami that it is important for a director to discuss ideas for a game with their team rather than giving orders, and to make the game together,” Johanas said. “He often said that if you make a game like a bonsai tree, it may take the shape the director had in mind, but each of the development staff will not feel their output is reflected. In that sense, freedom is very important. Of course, it is necessary for the director to decide the overall direction, but we have always valued an environment where the staff can create freely, rather than one where they are only allowed to as they are told. It's closer to the growth of a tree in nature than a bonsai tree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Mikami places a high level of trust in his staff, which is why so many of us have stayed at Tango Gameworks for so long. I hope to continue this culture of freedom in the future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>For information on recruitment at Tango Gameworks, check out </em><a href="https://www.krafton.com/ja/careers/jobs/?var_page=1&amp;search_list_cnt=10&amp;search_studio=TangoGameworks" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Krafton’s recruitment site</em></u></a><em>. </em><a href="https://x.com/rined1987" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Esra Krabbe</em></u></a><em> is an editor at IGN Japan.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-becomes-majority-shareholder-in-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-no-full-takeover-for-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Ring the changes.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has invested 50 billion yen (approx. $318 million) in FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa, putting the brakes on a full takeover for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the investment, Sony becomes the largest shareholder in Kadokawa, with 10% of the company’s shares. Chinese megacorp Tencent is next in-line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kadokawa and Sony have formed what the pair described as a ‘Strategic Capital and Business Alliance,’ with the goal to boost Kadokawa’s long list of intellectual properties globally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The announcement of the deal includes vague corporate speak about how the two companies plan to work together in the future, but there is a line about adapting Kadokawa’s IP into live-action films and TV dramas globally, co-producing anime works, and further expanding the publishing of Kadokawa’s games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That line in particular has already sparked speculation that Sony may help realise a live-action Elden Ring movie or TV series of some kind, but it’s worth pointing out that much of Sony’s interest in Kadokawa has to do with its anime business, as opposed to its video game business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony boss Hiroki Totoki commented: "Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of Kadokawa, which consistently creates a wide variety of IP, including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“By combining Kadokawa’s extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize Kadokawa’s 'Global Media Mix' strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony's long-term vision, 'Creative Entertainment Vision.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-may-find-it-hard-to-buy-all-of-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-financial-report-claims">financial experts said the PlayStation maker might have been put off the deal due to the cost of having to acquire all of Kadokawa</a>, rather than the parts it was actually interested in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kadokawa was reportedly only interested in doing a deal with Sony if it bought the entire company. Sony, however, was reportedly only interested in “extracting” assets related to anime and video games, which presumably included the developer of Elden Ring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buying all of Kadokawa would cost 640 billion yen (approx $4.3 billion), according to expert estimates. Sony’s cash for buyouts is apparently tight at the moment due to investments made elsewhere. As a point of comparison, Sony bought Destiny developer Bungie for $3.7 billion back in 2022. The studio has since suffered multiple rounds of layoffs and project cancelations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also the apparent prospect of a bidding war, or scope for Sony to buy 50% of Kadokawa and turn it into a subsidiary it doesn’t wholly own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kadokawa’s business extends into areas that fit into Sony’s broader entertainment offering, which includes anime, manga, TV, and film. Kadokawa is a prolific publisher of anime, and Sony already owns anime streamers Crunchyroll and Funimation. As well as FromSoftware, Kadokawa owns Danganronpa developer Spike Chunsoft, Octopath Traveler developer Acquire, and RPG Maker and Pixel Game Maker developer Gotcha Gotcha Games. Kadokawa is the majority owner of FromSoftware, with around 70% of the company. Sony already owns around 14% of the developer, with Tencent owning around 16%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Sony, its gaming business has already suffered significant layoffs this year and the closure of multiple studios, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-it-should-have-done-user-testing-and-internal-evaluation-earlier-on-concord"><u>Concord developer Firewalk</u></a>.
