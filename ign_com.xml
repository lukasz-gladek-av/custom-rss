IGN's Michael Higham called it an "investment that pays back multiple times over in its 120-hour runtime." He continued on to say that it's a "commitment - a slow-burn game you have to want to live in. But it’s also an action-packed cinematic adventure that proves to have an emotional range that the original didn’t."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It even secured a runner-up spot in our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-pc-game-of-2025">best PC games of 2025</a>, with IGN's Tom Marks saying "This massive medieval adventure could keep you playing well past the 100-hour mark, with tons of stories to unravel and quests to complete." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">review</a> also had glowing praise for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. Writer Leana Hafer called it "one part sequel and one part coronation, bringing a lot of the original's ideas to fruition." Has it piqued your interest? If so, this is a great time to grab it for just $30 before its price goes back up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-miss-your-chance-to-grab-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-for-30-at-amazon]]></content:encoded>

It also sounds like a Game Boy, and comes with classic-looking cartridges — though these only play tunes from the original Pokémon games' soundtrack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a neat touch, the cartridges include images from Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue that reflect the music on that particular cart. So, pop in a cartridge with the games' title screen on it, and it's the title screen music that you'll hear.
