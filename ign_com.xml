All items will also be available for purchase individually, alongside the Clint Eastwood jam track. Russel Hobbs and Murdoc Niccals will have outfits and accessories available to earn through the Season 10 Music Pass, alongside new jam tracks from MXZI, Hanumankind, and Stone Temple Pilots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic is also making a handful of improvements to the game coming with the update tomorrow, including adding "Good" notes so that it's more clear when you juuuuuust fall short of a "Perfect", and adjusting the design of lift notes so it's easier to tell when to press and when to let go. Both of these new designs can be turned off in the settings if you so choose.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite Festival is, as always, accessible via Fortnite's main menu, but has its own battle pass (Music Pass), modes, and other microtransactions. If you've never tried it out before, it's essentially a Harmonix-developed rhythm game attempting to invoke the studio's history with Rock Band, though it doesn't quite capture the same magic Rock Band did back in the day, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-festival-review">according to our 4/10 review from the game's launch</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
