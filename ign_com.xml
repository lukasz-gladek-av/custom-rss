He says that those who start a new meadowlands farm and open their animal door on day one will find that their chickens are vanishing. It’s a public service announcement that let’s players know that there's a small issue with update 1.6, and a fix is on the way. Until a follow-up patch arrives, ConcernedApe says players can blame their missing chickens on a sneaky coyote that only appears on day one.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">PSA: there is currently an issue, if you start a new farm on the meadowlands farm and open the animal door on the coop day 1, your chickens will disappear. If you leave the door closed for one day, it should save them. We will fix this. Lore: There is a wild coyote on the farm…</p>— ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853521395080368514?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear when Stardew Valley will fix its missing chicken problem. In the meantime, update 1.6 brings a field of other changes and additions for those still digging into the massively popular, cozy farming sim. Following its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valleys-big-16-update-boosts-its-steam-player-count-to-record-shattering-levels"><u>arrival on PC this past March</u></a>, the update dropped Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One today (you can see the full patch notes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-stardew-valley-16-finally-hits-console-and-mobile-169-patch-notes-reveal-further-changes"><u>here</u></a>), adding the ability to find lost items, use cheat commands on certain platforms, and more. ConcernedApe recommends players start a new farm to see everything update 1.6 has to offer, which is why it’s so important to make sure the word about that pesky coyote gets out there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave Stardew Valley a 10/10 in our updated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-review-2024"><u>2024 review</u></a>, calling it a “modern classic with an endless list of enticing activities to complete and a deeply satisfying time management challenge to take on.” For more on ConcernedApe’s farming masterpiece, you can read about how the creator only just <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-developer-finally-gets-the-hardest-achievement-in-his-own-game"><u>managed to nab the game’s hardest achievement last week</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-november-patch-notes-detail-spawn-logic-fixes-and-assault-rifle-balance-updates<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">More changes promised to arrive before November 14.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Treyarch and Raven Software have published yet another Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 update, this time targeting a few of the game’s more annoying elements, such as the flashbang screen effect, the Recon Combat Specialty, and the spawn system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The November 4 update is only the developer’s latest patch seeking to iron out the experience. Although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record"><u>players quickly took to this year’s Call of Duty</u></a> when its release date arrived a few weeks back, many have made it clear that there are more than a few kinks left to deal with. Today’s update is one of the beefiest yet, as it tackles common issues and more while promising to provide even more specific fixes in the future.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/wccfcallofdutyblackops63-1724866203623.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Update Address Flashbang and Spawn Complaints</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One tool that players of every skill level can’t seem to stand is the flashbang, which has been called out for the lengthy affect it has on players’ screens. On smaller maps like Nuketown, of which there are a few of in Black Ops 6, the flashbang leaves Operators unable to see their screen for long portions of each match. Post update, players will notice that the duration of the effect has been reduced by 20%. Whether it calms complaints remains to be seen, but it’s clear Treyarch is at least listening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other common talking points the team sought to address with today’s patch include the spawn system and Recon Combat Specialty. The former is often a point of contention in any Call of Duty entry, so it should be nice to hear that spawn logic has been tuned across “several” Multiplayer maps in Black Ops 6.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Our number one goal is to always provide the safest spawn that we can across all maps and game modes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"Spawn tuning will be an ongoing process of taking in data, reviewing gameplay and making measured adjustments in the live environment," a developer note says. "Our number one goal is to always provide the safest spawn that we can across all maps and game modes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Recon, meanwhile, has left many concerned thanks to its ability to allow players to see through walls for a short time after respawning. The Perk combination bonus has now had its duration reduced from 2 seconds to 1.5, with Treyarch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-nerf-a-perk-so-overpowered-some-call-it-a-wallhack"><u>promising to reduce it even further</u></a> ahead of Season 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the highlights for those looking for a less frustrating Multiplayer experience, but a number of weapon balance adjustments found their way into the November 4 Black Ops 6 update, too. Assault rifles like the XM4 and Model L received nerfs to their long-range damage, while more than a few SMGs had their range buffed. Most of the new Black Ops 6 patch focuses on tweaking Multiplayer, but Zombies players will notice that GobbleGum names should now properly update when players switch between tier tabs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s update follows <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-november-1-patch-fixes-troublesome-black-screen-glitch-and-other-issues"><u>a November 1 patch</u></a> that squashed a number of bugs and exploits across the Multiplayer and Zombies modes. Although today’s fix fleshes out the experience even more, the team will surely polish the FPS further in the coming days and weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launched October 25 and will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-gets-nuketown-this-week-as-activision-reveals-season-1-plans"><u>begin its first season of content on November 14</u></a>. For more on, you can read our reviews for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review"><u>Campaign</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review"><u>Multiplayer</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-review"><u>Zombies</u></a> modes. We gave Multiplayer an 8/10, saying, “Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 plays it safe but is otherwise exactly what Call of Duty multiplayer should be: fast, fun, and a little on the ridiculous side.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For everything else revealed in today’s patch, you can see the list of all the changes below. Specific weapon adjustments can be found on the patch notes page <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/10/bo6-preseason-patch-notes#nov4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>here</u></a>, and make sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/Best_Guns_Ranked_(Launch_Meta)">ranking of the best guns</a> as well would <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/Black_Ops_6_Zombies_Guide">Black Ops 6 Zombies Guide</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 November 4, 2024 Patch Notes</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>GLOBAL</strong></h3><strong>Stability </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Improved stability when interacting with the Message of the Day. </li><li>Improved stability when sending voice communications. </li></ul><strong>Progression </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Completion display will now properly appear when completing Prestige Challenges in both Multiplayer and Zombies. </li></ul><strong>Operators </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed an issue where Bailey wasn’t holding an intended Pistol in the Operator selection menu. </li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>MULTIPLAYER</strong></h3><strong>Maps </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nuketown<ul data-cy="list"><li>Nuketown is now available in Private Matches.  </li></ul></li></ul><strong>Modes </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed an issue where players were spawned in when joining a session in progress instead of spectating before selecting a Loadout.
