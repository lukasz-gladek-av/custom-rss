The contents of these free updates will differ depending on the game.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, these upgrades are free, and are not the same as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/Nintendo_Switch_2_Edition_Games_List">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games</a>, which are premium upgrades (or, in the case of The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, free upgrades to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what can Switch 2 owners expect? Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, for example, get an “improved image quality” for high-resolution TVs and an “improved” framerate for “smoother movement.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario Odyssey, on the other hand, gets HDR support and GameShare support, so two people can play together online, with one player controlling Mario and the other controlling Cappy. All the details are below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Nintendo's list does not mention framerate fixes for the two top-down Zelda games, which is a strange and disappointing omission given their performance problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-san-francisco-interview-with-nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser">our interview with Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser</a> to find out more about the just-opened Nintendo San Francisco store, and all things Nintendo Switch.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo San Francisco Store Photos</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Here’s the list of free updates for selected Nintendo Switch games:</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clubhouse-games-51-worldwide-classics">51 Worldwide Games</a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Software update release date:</strong> 05/06/2025</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>GameShare support: up to four people can play 34 games.

The game was due out fall 2025 but is now delayed to spring 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Bloomberg put it:</p><blockquote>PlayStation leadership didn’t give Haven staff a reason for her departure, but it came several weeks after an external test of Haven’s first game, the online shooter Fairgames, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Some developers at Haven were concerned about how the game was received and its progress, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is sticking with Haven and Fairgames for now, with new co-studio heads Marie-Eve Danis and Pierre-François Sapinski in place.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s yet more trouble for Sony’s embattled live service ambition, which now appears to be in full retreat. While Arrowhead’s Helldivers 2 was a breakout hit, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, Sony’s other live service games were either canceled or suffered disastrous launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Sony’s Concord is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history, lasting just a couple of weeks before it was brought offline amid eye-wateringly low player numbers. Sony later decided to kill the game entirely and shut its developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Concord flop came after Sony had already canceled Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us multiplayer game. And earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony reportedly canceled two unannounced live service games</u></a>, one a God of War title in development at Bluepoint, the other in the works at Days Gone developer Bend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony announced plans in February 2022 to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-by-2026">launch more than 10 live service games by March 2026</a>, later saying <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstations-10-live-service-games-will-be-from-different-genres-and-for-different-audiences">the push would bring games of different genres to different audiences</a>. It spent big on studio buyouts as part of the drive, bringing in Destiny developer Bungie, Jade Raymond's Haven Studios, and the now shuttered Firewalk Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in 2023, Sony president Hiroki Totoki said the company was reviewing the 12 live service PlayStation games it had in the works, and committed to launching only six of them by the end of financial year 2025, meaning by the end of March 2026. Totoki said Sony was still working on when the other six live service games would come out, adding: "It's not that we stick to certain titles, but for the gamers quality should be the most important.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie is still flying the live service flag, with Destiny 2 ongoing and the in-development Marathon set to launch fully later this year. Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-teamlfg-a-new-playstation-studio-spun-out-of-bungie-thats-making-a-team-based-action-game-inspired-by-fighting-games-mobas-and-frog-type-games">Sony announced a new PlayStation studio called teamLFG and teased its debut game</a>, which is a live service incubation project. Guerrilla’s Horizon multiplayer game is also in development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

And, you know, that scoundrel fantasy of Kay mixing with the pirate fantasy of Hondo, it just kind of makes sense, right?" Rechner told IGN. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And we also knew that Kay would be kind of coming into her own, learning what it means to be a leader, and then having someone like Hondo as a mentor - or is he? - we thought it led to really interesting things."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The DLC adds a new adventure to the main game featuring the Rokana Raiders crime gang, the Miyuki Trade League who can supply Kay with upgrades for her Trailblazer ship, and a new blaster capability called Shock. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars Outlaws is also getting a Nintendo Switch 2 release on September 4, but Rechner refused to spill details on whether the new platform would bring any new features to the game, but did say that there was more information to come. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In terms of a specific feature set, that's something that we will get into later. So we'll have more stuff to talk about later."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the Switch 2's features that the game could take advantage of are controllers that can be used as a mouse and a new GameChat capability. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial. She's been a professional nerd since 2006 when she got her start on Official PlayStation Magazine in the UK, and has since worked for GamesIndustry.Biz, Rolling Stone and GamesRadar. She loves horror, horror movies, horror games, and French Bulldogs. Those extra wrinkles on her face are thanks to going time blind and staying up too late finishing every sidequest in RPGs like Fallout and Witcher 3.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In fact, he said Nintendo's support of third-party publishers this time around was better than it has been in the past:</p><blockquote>"We're launching four titles with Nintendo Switch 2, and that's I think a bigger array of releases than we've ever offered before with a new Nintendo platform. Historically, being a third party in the Nintendo business has been a bit challenging. I think Nintendo has been very forthcoming in addressing that. And we're stepping up too, because we have great optimism for the platform. In terms of what we would bring to any platform, we address it on a case-by-case basis, we obviously want to be where the consumers are. But we would not necessarily bring every title to every platform. There are also great catalog opportunities as well."</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Take-Two is bringing Civilization 7 (June 5, launch day), the NBA 2K and WWE 2K series (unclear which games, or when), and Borderlands 4 (September 12). Those admittedly aren't surprising inclusions, as Take-Two was already publishing all four franchises on the Nintendo Switch. But Zelnick's quote does make it sound like the door could be open in the future to other releases, especially from Take-Two's back catalog. GTA 6 probably won't make the cut, but perhaps GTA V, one of these days?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke directly to Zelnick ahead of the investor call about the company's quarter, including discussion of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-development-began-in-earnest-in-2020-following-the-massive-success-of-red-dead-redemption-2-take-two-says">GTA 6's development timeline,</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-delays-pain-me-how-could-they-not-but-insists-gta-6s-new-2026-release-date-was-about-making-sure-rockstar-achieves-its-creative-vision-with-no-limitations">Zelnick's thoughts</a> on the game's recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">delay to next year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
