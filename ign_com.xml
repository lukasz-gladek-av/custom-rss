Riot said that after considering "a range of options," it decided to sell the IP rights back to Simon Collins-Laflamme as this "gives players the best chance to one day experience a revised version of the game they've been waiting for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Development on the game had been stagnating despite its sale to Riot, but Collins-Laflamme is set on resurrecting the dying IP, confirming he has "<a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>rehired</u></a> more than 30 developers who know this game inside and out, with additional returns expected in the coming days."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the revival efforts, Collins-Laflamme also shared a chunk of "raw and broken" gameplay taken on the "original legacy engine," which he then shared on YouTube.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">fuck it 16 minutes of new hytale gameplay on the timeline <a href="https://t.co/KTqrk8n5Ie" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KTqrk8n5Ie</a></p>— Myne (@not_mynes) <a href="https://twitter.com/not_mynes/status/1991124997637574787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"This Hytale footage reflects the latest chapter in the game’s revival," the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhaqjb_S2X8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>video description</u></a> said. "Recorded in a single morning and put together by Simon. No bells or whistles. Just the game as it is. Raw and broken, but still beautiful. There’s a long road ahead, but early access is coming soon."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collins-Laflamme left a personal note to would-be players, too, writing: "I promised players videos, screenshots, and blog posts. One day after the acquisition, I’m keeping that promise. Now that you’ve seen the first gameplay footage in a long time, I’m heading back to work on the early access launch. The team will share more clips and screenshots as we go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It mattered to me to release raw footage today so we break the curse once and for all."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post </a>celebrating that Hytale had been "saved," Collins-Laflamme wrote: "Transactions like this are rare in the games industry. Thank you to everyone for keeping hope alive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale was announced in December 2018 with a trailer that has an incredible 61 million views on <a href="https://youtu.be/o77MzDQT1cg?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>. Here’s the official blurb, as it was back then:</p><blockquote>Hytale combines the scope of a sandbox with the depth of a roleplaying game, immersing players in a procedurally generated world where teetering towers and deep dungeons promise rich rewards throughout their adventures. Hytale supports everything from block-by-block construction to scripting and minigame creation, delivered using easy to use and powerful tools.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Excitement around Hytale was fueled by the experience of the developers themselves, who co-founded Hypixel, one of the most influential Minecraft servers in the world. Riot invested in the project and eventually bought the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
