            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has swiftly disabled the game's Peaceful Hips emote, a collaboration with James Gunn and John Cena's DCU <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/peacemaker">Peacemaker</a> TV series, following a bombshell twist at the end of the show's most recent episode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for Peacemaker Season 2 Episode 6 follow.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans were left stunned when Peacemaker's latest episode revealed that the show's alternate "Earth-2" setting was in fact "Earth-X," a fascist, Nazi world where the U.S. flag features a swastika. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many fans now say Peacemaker had subtly pointed to this twist the whole season, as Cena's dance in the show's opening credits includes arm movements suggestive of a swastika — the same dance moves seen in the Peaceful Hips emote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But none of this seemed likely before the last episode aired — and judging by a statement released by Fortnite maker Epic Games over the weekend, the developer was just as surprised to discover what looks to be the true meaning of the emote it now had in the game.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>DC Peacemaker 'Peaceful Hips' Emote will be disabled </p><p>"As we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote. Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days. Sorry folks." <a href="https://t.co/gQ4oARbf6f" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/gQ4oARbf6f</a></p></div>— iFireMonkey (@iFireMonkey) <a href="https://twitter.com/iFireMonkey/status/1972169742258786433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"We're disabling the Peaceful Hips Emote in Fortnite as we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote," Epic Games <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1972168326551138447" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on its Fortnite Status social media account. "Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days. Sorry folks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games' statement doesn't sound positive for the emote remaining in Fortnite, but what's even more extraordinary is the suggestion that developer — who worked closely with DC Studios on the collaboration — was left to discover the dance's true nature alongside audiences, and was now scrambling to get an explanation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have already begun to fret over what any potential schism might mean for the future of DC's popular collaborations within Fortnite, and whether the two companies would continue to work together. IGN has contacted Epic Games for comment. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In general, fan response to the emote being pulled has been mixed, with some acknowledging the potential for the "Nazi emote," as it's been dubbed, to subsequently be misused by players to grief others. Others, however, have questioned why Epic Games has acted here but not in other similar situations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, Fortnite recently raised eyebrows by adding the Tylil Dance, an emote collaboration with rapper Kai Cenat which features music by Kanye West. West, who now refers to himself as Ye, previously made numerous comments deemed to be anti-semitic and in 2022 said he identified as "a Nazi." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In another example, Fortnite has notably shied away from reselling an in-game skin, Rue, whose costume players widely likened to the design of a Nazi uniform. The skin remains within the game, though is now one of Fortnite's rarest — as Epic Games has chosen not to sell it in over five years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Peacemaker's latest episode, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-gunn-answers-our-burning-questions-about-peacemakers-explosive-sixth-episode-and-why-that-cameo-is-consequential-to-the-dcu">IGN recently chatted with Gunn about the show</a> and its other big surprise, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/peacemaker-season-2s-big-dcu-cameo-revealed-in-episode-6">cameo by Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has revealed Borderlands 4’s first of two new Vault Hunters coming to the game as part of the paid Story Pack DLCs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">C4SH, due out during the first quarter of 2026, is a playable character whose luck-based powers can make him either the best or worst character in the game, Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/nfyubGFy_AE?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a panel at Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb, from Gearbox:</p><blockquote>A former casino dealer bot, C4SH is now a drifter who chases the probability-breaking highs of cursed eldritch artifacts. As luck would have it, Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned is full of cosmic horrors that harbor uncanny curios, some of which can surely bend the odds in C4SH's favor.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">C4SH has three unique Action Skills to choose from, as you’d expect, and three skill trees that each have three branches full of passives and other customization options. C4SH works differently to the other Vault Hunters, however, by having unpredictable Action Skills. Gearbox said they all involve an element of chance as part of a risk-reward playstyle that “can lead to good fortunes like buffing himself and allies, dealing devastating damage, sapping the strength from foes, and more.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the panel, Pitchford revealed a work-in-progress look at C4SH’s card Action Skill, which has big Gambit vibes. Pitchford, a professional magician himself, said C4SH was “very dear to me, very personal to me.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because of chance, with luck he can be the most powerful Vault Hunter in the game. But of course, with bad luck it’s the opposite. The gameplay with cash is definitely high risk, high reward. I think it’s a lot of fun. It makes my heart pound.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“C4SH is important to me because I think he and I have a lot in common. Some of you might not know this, but I have played poker professionally, as a gambler. I have appeared on a live reality television show in America about playing Texas Hold'em Poker. And I’ve felt what it’s like to take risks and to have that work out and have extreme success from chance, but also to miss out and lose my money.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/28/g15shqnamaaijsr-1759090620762.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">C4SH is due out Q1 2026.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “Another thing some of you may know about me is that in addition to being a game developer, I’m a professional magician. And I’ve mastered sleight of hand with playing cards, and we used my demonstration to help animate the character in the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford proceeded to show behind-the-scenes footage of the developer in his office at the Texas studio palming, flicking, and throwing playing cards from a first-person perspective, footage he said the animators used to help animate C4SH. Pitchford then showed a work-in-progress look at C4SH’s card action skill alongside first-person footage of himself performing the card actions.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">IN GAME ANIMATION FOR C4SH'S CARD ACTION SKILL<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Borderlands4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Borderlands4</a> <a href="https://t.co/R59KmkhFrZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/R59KmkhFrZ</a></p>— EpicNNG (@EpicNNG) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNNG/status/1972135452221362439?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll get C4SH as soon as he’s available by owning the Borderlands 4 Super Deluxe Edition, the Vault Hunter Pack (included in Super Deluxe Edition), or Story Pack 1: Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned (included in Vault Hunter Pack).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, meanwhile, adds multiple main and side missions set in a new zone of Kairos, new gear to earn, and new cosmetics as well as C4SH.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 launched this month with four playable characters: Vex; Rafa; Amon, and Harlowe.
