            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nexus-mods-owner-steps-down-after-24-years-to-focus-on-mental-health<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">PC gaming mod hub Nexus Mods is under new ownership for the first time in 24 years as creator Robin “Dark0ne” Scott hands off the baton for the sake of his mental health.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The figurehead of one of the biggest gaming sites on the internet posted about its next chapter in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301?mtm_kwd=newsfeed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a message</u></a> published today. It comes with confirmation that Scott has already officially stepped away from Nexus Mods, “following months of meetings, face-to-face talks, and a whole lot of soul searching.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The message keeps many of the behind-the-scenes details under wraps but says two new individuals — one named Victor (a.k.a. <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Foledinho" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Foledinho</u></a>) and another named Marinus (a.k.a. <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/rapsak" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rapsak</u></a>) — have adopted the leadership role, with both of their profiles now bearing the “Site Owner” title. The leadership change signals the beginning of a new era for Nexus Mods, and for Scott, a much-needed break.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll,” Scott explained. “The stress of the job has been a regular source of anxiety and stress-related health issues. I realised that I have been burning out and this started to have an impact on my staff and Nexus Mods as a whole. So, I firmly believe that the best thing for the future of Nexus Mods is for me to step aside and bring in new leadership to steer the business forward with renewed energy to make Nexus Mods the modding community we all truly deserve.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The small project born in Scott’s bedroom for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind eventually ballooned into a massive entity in the gaming space. The Nexus Mods <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/about" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>About Us page</u></a> notes that this beating heart of the PC gaming community is made up of 63.4 million users and 16.8 billion file downloads, positioning it as one of the most highly trafficked UK-based websites on the planet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Nexus Mods has grown, so too has its impact on Scott, who has spent “every single day” for more than 20 years “on call.” Losing his direct input in the day-to-day operations of Nexus Mods will surely result in some changes, but Scott assured modders and gamers alike that the shift should not be cause for concern.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“Behind the scenes, I’ve already been stepping back bit by bit,” Scott clarifies. “Over the past few years, the team has taken on more of the weight and the site’s been doing better than ever. What’s changing now is simply the formality of it, making sure the right people are in place to guide Nexus Mods into the next era.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scott says his stepping down from Nexus Mods, as well as a few small structural changes, are moves made to ensure “long-term stability” and won’t impact how the site has been operating recently. He goes as far as to say, “Nexus Mods is community-first and mod-author focused, that’s not up for negotiation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Scott steps away from his direct leadership position, the modding creator says he’ll still engage with the Nexus Mods community on its Mod Author Discord, forums, and more. He’ll also help guide the site’s 40-person team as the page is turned, relieving his duties as its face and figurehead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So yes, the ownership of Nexus Mods has changed hands, but I want to be clear, this isn’t some corporate ‘exit’ or a backroom deal,” Scott adds. “This is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nexus Mods has housed thousands of fan-made creations for games like franchises like The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Stardew Valley, Baldur’s Gate, Cyberpunk 2077, and many, many more for decades. In fact, just moments after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion shadow-dropped earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-mods-have-already-been-published-online">dozens of minor mods had already been published on the site</a>. It’s the go-to place for PC gamers to modify their games to their liking, and with its first change in leadership in 24 years comes a fair amount of uncertainty for its future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

But these items won't be cheap — and seemingly won't be available very often.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Go has recently allowed users to engage with more of the game's activities remotely, and begun selling items that bestow the stat-boosting Lucky Friend status on players when trading creatures. Now, the introduction of Bottle Caps marks another new frontier for the game, as something that will inarguably offer a gameplay advantage — better, stronger stats for the Pokémon of your choice — in exchange for your money.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first Gold Bottle Cap, singular, will be offered as part of a new $19.99 event pass, GO Pass Deluxe: Ancients Recovered, which is set to be made available from Monday, June 23 until Sunday, June 29. Previous passes have cost either $7.99 or $14.99, making this offering the most expensive pass yet. It will also be the first time players will have overlapping event passes, as the monthly June pass will still be ongoing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While a free version of the Ancients Recovered pass will also be available, Pokémon Go's first Gold Bottle Cap will only be offered in the pass' Deluxe version, which is a paid upgrade. The free pass will include an encounter with a Legendary Pokémon (one of the Regi family), three Pikachu wearing "dapper" costumes, plus Stardust, XP and other items. The paid upgrade adds Zacian and Zamazenta masks for your in-game avatar, plus premium in-game items such as Incense, an Incubator and Lure Modules, as well as that Gold Bottle Cap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you buy the premium upgrade via your browser on the Pokémon Go Web Store — outside of the game, and therefore outside of Apple and Google's pesky platform fees — you will additionally receive 10 Max Revives, 10 Max Potions, five Premium Battle Passes, five Max Particle Packs, a Max Mushroom, and an Incubator. And then there's the even more premium GO Pass: Deluxe: Ancients Recovered + 10 Ranks bundle, which unlocks the first 10 event pass tiers immediately and comes with even more Incubators when acquired via a Web Store purchase.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/16/736-a-new-way-to-power-up-pokmon-is-coming-to-pokmon-go-00-00-09-1750066518265.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go's Golden Bottle Cap. (Detective Pikachu not included.)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the full details regarding Gold Bottle Caps are being confirmed today, the game's community has been expecting their announcement for several months after traces of the feature were spotted by dataminers within the game's code. Various concepts for their implementation have been discussed, and fans have had much to say on how they expect the feature to be introduced, how much it will cost, and how it will affect game balance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of today's announcement, I put these concerns to Pokémon Go game director Michael Steranka, who said the feature had been designed to ensure Pokémon Go as a whole would not become pay-to-win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have been really careful with the design for Bottle Caps," Steranka told IGN, during an interview held at the game's big Go Fest 2025 live event in Paris this past weekend. "That's something where, if we weren't thoughtful with the integration, it could really destroy the economy of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"An item like a Bottle Cap is only going to be available very, very rarely," he continued. "And because of that, we don't feel that players will be able to just spend their way to having the best of the best of everything. And even once you obtain a Bottle Cap, it's actually going to be quite a lot of effort for people to Hyper Train their Pokémon to get their stats up."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p> "It's not something that is just an immediate, you know, spend money and then get powerful Pokémon type of a system.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once unlocked via the event pass and applied to the Pokémon of your choice, a Gold Bottle Cap will begin a new feature, Hyper Training, that requires you complete tasks to slowly level your Pokémon's stats over time. Raising a Pokémon's Attack stat requires you battle using the Pokémon while it is set as your Buddy. Boosting defense will be possible as you strengthen your bond with your Buddy, by playing together, exploring, and catching other Pokémon. Levelling up HP, meanwhile, will see you exploring alongside your trainee as a buddy, spinning PokéStops, earning Buddy Candy, or via other adventures. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact that this further gameplay is also required will also help protect game balance, Steranka continued. "It's not something that is just an immediate, you know, spend money and then get powerful Pokémon type of a system," he said. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of today's official announcement, I spent some time at Go Fest 2025 chatting with players about their thoughts on the current state of Pokémon Go, and of the previously-datamined suggestion that Bottle Caps could be introduced at some point in the future. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid some excitement for the feature's arrival, a key question I heard from fans was how often Gold Bottle Caps would be offered — and the suggestion they needed to provided sparingly, in order to preserve game balance, and also to ensure players never felt continually pressured to spend money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's announcement describes Gold Bottle Caps as "extremely rare" and states that "obtaining one is a special occasion, so select your trainee wisely!" When asked how often Gold Bottle Caps would be offered to players, Steranka said the exact frequency of their availability was still to be announced. Still, he confirmed, they would remain a rare item, and not another item designed to simply be always available via Pokémon Go's in-game shop.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/16/bafkreiakqe47b5kliht3pu3iieqmsf26d7d6coh6yftfdujte5bcjjuipy-1750066497410.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go Fest 2025 in Paris. Image credit: IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the past, Pokémon Go has offered the ultra-rare Master Ball item a handful of times over the past few years — and this frequency is something I heard a majority of players saying they thought would be fitting for Bottle Caps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think we're ready to share the frequency that Bottle Caps will be available," Steranka said when I asked about the exact availability of the item going forward, "but it definitely will be one of the most rare items in the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the item's price, some fans have rationalised a high cost would be likely due to the sheer rarity of finding a 100% stat Pokémon via other means, such as paying for hundreds of chances to try and encounter the creature through normal gameplay such as raids. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prior to the announcement, players had wondered whether other forms of Bottle Cap would be available, which perhaps might raise a Pokémon's stats by a fraction, or be offered for free. That does not seem to be the case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Right now we're launching with the Gold Bottle Cap, and that will enable you to train with a Pokémon to take any Pokémon up to max stats," Steranka confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a busy year for Pokémon Go, whose development team now sits as part of Monopoly Go owner Scopely, following the recent closing of its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-dev-moves-to-reassure-players-after-35-billion-sale-to-monopoly-go-company-is-confirmed">$3.5 billion buyout of Niantic's gaming portfolio</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
