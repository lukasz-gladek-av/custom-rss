Whether you’re looking for the extra protection a case can bring, the better ergonomics of a great controller, or a backup battery to ensure you’re never without juice, we’ve got you covered with great gear for your Switch Lite. Check out a <a href="#switch" data-cy="styled-link">detailed look at the best Nintendo Switch Lite accessories</a>, or check the shopping list below: </p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR – These are the best Nintendo Switch Lite Accessories:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch Lite is more compact with a smaller screen compared to the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-switch"><u>Switch</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-oled-review"><u>OLED model</u></a>, which means some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-accessories"><u>best Nintendo Switch accessories</u></a> aren’t compatible with this ultra-portable model. That’s why we’ve created a guide just for the Lite, so you can kit it out to be a real road warrior, and you might be able to score some awesome <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals"><u>Nintendo Switch deals</u></a> in the process.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="switch"><u><strong></strong></u></h2><p id="best-case"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best case">1. Nintendo Switch Lite Carry Case + Screen Protector</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Nintendo Switch Lite Case</h3><div catalogid="6f946ddf-b268-49ce-b3a5-c703b748fece" id="211062"><div id="211062" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch Lite Carry Case + Screen Protector</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Providing 360-degree protection with minimal bulk, this case securely zips, has space for game cartridges, and even comes with a screen protector.</p></div></div><div><div><p>360-degree protection with minimal bulk</p></div><div><p>Includes a screen protector</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Your Nintendo Switch Lite's portability is one of its chief assets, and you shouldn't have to sacrifice that to protect it when you're on the go. The Nintendo Switch Lite Carry Case + Screen protector should have you covered. It adds minimal bulk by sticking close to the dimensions of the Switch Lite itself while providing 360-degree protection. There are also some fun designs to match different Switch games, like the Animal Crossing design we’ve linked, but unfortunately, Bells aren’t an accepted currency. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-case">best Nintendo Switch cases</a> you can buy, adding simple convenience and peace of mind. It zips and unzips easily to slide your Switch Lite in nice and snug or out when you’re ready to get your game on. Though compact, the case still offers additional storage for you to carry a collection of game cartridges. Finally, with this combo, you get a screen protector, so even when you throw it in your backpack without the case, you don’t need to worry about scratching the screen. Coming in around $25, this is an excellent investment in protection. </p></div><p id="best-rugged-case"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best rugged case">2. ButterFox Switch Lite Carrying Case</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Nintendo Switch Lite Rugged Case</h3><div catalogid="6f946ddf-b268-49ce-b3a5-c703b748fece" id="211063"><div id="211063" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>ButterFox Switch Lite Carrying Case</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Bulky case offering a sturdy shell and plenty of storage space, including a mesh pocket and two storage layers for 19 game cartridges and two microSD cards.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't mind a little extra bulk while toting your Nintendo Switch Lite around, the ButterFox Switch Lite Carrying Case is an excellent option. It offers a sturdy shell with a nifty handle to protect your Switch Lite from drops and scratches and room to house all your favorite accessories. You even get a bunch of different color options to choose from. And best of all, this case is incredibly affordable, so you can snag it for under $20 and have money left over to score some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-game-deals">great game deals</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the Nintendo Switch Lite Carry Case, ButterFox provides plenty of space for storage and uses it cleverly. Two organizer layers offer slots for 19 game cartridges and two microSD cards, so you should rarely be without your favorite games. These layers double as a protective microfiber lining over the screen and a buffer to keep other accessories from pressing the Switch Lite's controls. A mesh pocket provides room to hold charging cables, earbuds, and even a modest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-portable-power-banks"><u>portable charger</u></a>, while quality zippers ensure everything remains safely tucked away in the case.  </p></div><p id="best-cover"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best cover">3. Hori DuraFlexi Protector</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Nintendo Switch Lite Cover</h3><div catalogid="6f946ddf-b268-49ce-b3a5-c703b748fece" id="211064"><div id="211064" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hori DuraFlexi Protector</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Wrapping the Switch Lite in flexible TPU that absorbs shock, the Hori DuraFlexi Protector keeps your device safe while giving you access to essential controls and ports.</p></div></div><div><p>Flexible TPU absorbs shock and protects</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Nintendo Switch is designed to be used with your TV and sometimes on the go, the Switch Lite is a true traveler. That makes it much more susceptible to damage out in the wild. The power of just a bit of plastic wrapped around the device could be the difference between making it or breaking it, literally. The Hori DuraFlexi Protector should hopefully prevent the latter from happening. It covers the Switch Lite around the sides and back in a flexible TPU that can absorb shock and protect the portable console, similar to a phone case. So, if you have butter fingers or just want to slide your Switch into a bag without hassling with a carrying case, this cover is for you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Hori DuraFlexi Protector is classy, simple with Pokemon and Animal Crossing designs available. The cover also features perfectly placed cutouts to ensure you can easily access all of the Switch Lite's ports while the sleeve is on, so when you’re juicing up, you won’t have to remove the cover. The material used even gives you a bit of extra grip. And while the impressively low price tag may raise some red flags, it's worth noting that the DuraFlexi protector is officially licensed by Nintendo.</p></div><p id="best-rugged-cover"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best rugged cover">4. Orzly Grip Case</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Nintendo Switch Lite Rugged Cover</h3><div catalogid="6f946ddf-b268-49ce-b3a5-c703b748fece" id="211065"><div id="211065" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Orzly Grip Case</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>A rugged case delivering protection from drops, extra grip for the body and thumbsticks, and a kickstand.</p></div></div><div><p>Handles improve Switch Lite’s ergonomics</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Are you one of those people prone to dropping all of your electronics? You’ll be covered, literally, with the Orzly Grip Case. This cover is rubberized and ready to put your Nintendo Switch Lite in a protective embrace, covering all around to shield it from your flimsy grip. It’ll prevent bumps and scrapes while also giving your hands more grip. And though this is an excellent rugged case, it adds just 25 grams of weight to your Switch Lite, so you won't have to stop calling it Lite just because you've tucked it into this case. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What you get from the Orzly Grip Case is far more than just protection for the console. Orzly added thicker handles to the sides, making up for the lack of ergonomics around the Switch Lite's controls. This kit also provides covers for the thumbsticks for more tactile control and less wear. There’s even some storage, so you won’t have to leave your favorite games behind, while a kickstand on the case allows you to enjoy content hands-free. Orzly makes this case in a variety of colors, and it’s super affordable, making it easy to keep your device safe and your vibe intact. </p></div><p id="best-screen-protector"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best screen protector">5. amFilm Tempered Glass Screen Protector</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Nintendo Switch Lite Screen Protector</h3><div catalogid="6f946ddf-b268-49ce-b3a5-c703b748fece" id="211066"><div id="211066" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>amFilm Tempered Glass Screen Protector</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Keep the Switch Lite’s plastic screen free from scratches and damage with this glossy, premium glass screen protector kit.</p></div></div><div><p>Installation kit included</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch Lite features a plastic screen just like its console brethren, which means it'll be very prone to scratching. You're going to want a screen protector to prevent any damage. There are a ton of Switch Lite screen protectors popping up on the market, but amFilm's Tempered Glass Screen Protector is the tried and true most trusted. It’s also a super affordable way to keep your Switch safe, costing just under $10. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This particular Switch Lite screen protector is made of tempered glass, which won't scratch nearly as easily as the plastic screen, giving your handheld the glossy, premium glass screen it should have had from the get-go. You get more than just the screen protector, as the kit offers wet wipes, a microfiber cleaning cloth, and a squeeze card to ensure the smoothest installation possible without any dust bubbles or smudges. amFilm’s Tempered Glass Screen Protector also happens to be a three-pack, so you'll have enough screen protectors to use as replacements for years to come—or if you screw up installation on the first attempt. </p></div><p id="best-grip"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best grip">6. Satisfye Switch Lite Grip</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Nintendo Switch Lite Grip</h3><div catalogid="6f946ddf-b268-49ce-b3a5-c703b748fece" id="211067"><div id="211067" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Satisfye Switch Lite Grip</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Upgrade your hold on the Switch Lite thanks to the Satisfye grip, which adds two palm fins and thumb pads for extra protection and a tactile feel.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Holds Switch Lite securely in place</p></div><div><p>Included thumbstick covers can be awkward to use</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't let your hands suffer from the small controls and tight grip that come along with the Nintendo Switch Lite. You can upgrade your hold with the grip from Satisfye. This attachment slides right onto your Switch Lite, adding two palm fins to give your hands something to really grab onto, while the included thumb pads add extra protection and a tactile feel. The grip also helps give your thumbs a bit more room to move, especially when reaching for the D-Pad or right thumbstick, making your entire gaming experience much more enjoyable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We loved the version of the grip from Satisfye for the full-size <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/13/satisfye-gaming-grip-for-nintendo-switch-review"><u>Nintendo Switch</u></a>, so it's nice to see a model for the smaller Switch Lite. The technology loaded into this grip ensures your device is held tightly in place without any damage to the chassis, and the Switch won’t overheat, as there’s ample airflow. You’re not going to find a better way to improve the overall ergonomics of the compact device, as the grip offers more of a controller-like feel that your hands will thank you for.</p></div><p id="best-memory-card"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best memory card">7.

The 32GB of internal storage probably isn’t going to cut it, and that’s where a memory card like the PNY XLR8 128GB Gaming can come in handy. The 128GB of extra space should provide plenty of room for your game library. Best of all, it costs just $15. And if you think you'll need more storage, you can snag a larger version of the microSD or grab a second one to split up your library onto multiple drives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PNY XLR8 128GB Gaming memory card comes toting not only the space but also all the speed needed to get cruising through your games. You get fast read speeds of 100MB/s to ensure you're not wasting precious battery life while waiting for games to load up.

But if you know you're going to have a long day away from a power outlet, it doesn't hurt to have a bit of extra power available. Anker makes some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-portable-power-banks"><u>best portable chargers</u></a> you can get, and Anker PowerCore Essential 20000 is the perfect partner for your device.

However, the Switch is still plagued with some connection issues, but you can get around that problem with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/11/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-gaming-headset-review"><u>SteelSeries Arctis 1</u></a>. This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-wireless-headsets-for-gaming"><u>wireless gaming headset</u></a> offers a USB-C dongle that can plug directly into the bottom of the Switch to deliver a lag-free, lossless audio connection. You can also use a wired connection. It doesn't get much better than that level of versatility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The headset itself totes a durable, comfortable build with a decent clamping force to ensure a snug fit, while the plush earcups house 40mm neodymium drivers that deliver crisp, clear audio. Being wireless, battery life is important, and the 20 hours offered by the SteelSeries Arctis 1 should be plenty to last through your longest gaming marathons. Best of all is the sub-$100 price tag, making these cans a steal.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Razer Barracuda X</h3></div></output></p></div><p id="best-bluetooth-headset"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Bluetooth headset">10.

Enter the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-headset">best Nintendo Switch headset</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/razer-barracuda-x-review"><u>Razer Barracuda X</u></a>. You can connect them to your Switch via Bluetooth for the basics or slide in the USB-C dongle and enjoy high-quality, low-latency audio piped wirelessly to the headset. If you forget the dongle at home and don’t like the latency of Bluetooth, the headset can connect over the classic 3.5mm headset jack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Razer Barracuda X totes all that capability while rocking a comfortable, lightweight build. You get a classy, subtle design with a detachable boom mic to fly under the radar when wearing them out and about. The earcups have a breathable material and house 40mm TriForce drivers to deliver crisp, detailed audio. You’d think there might be a few cut corners or missing features at this price point, but Razer didn’t even settle for lackluster battery life, as these headphones can run for up to 60 hours.</p></div><p id="best-controllers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best controllers">11.

By pairing these wireless controllers to your handheld, you’ll get back HD rumble as well as the infrared and motion-sensing sensors that some games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/1-2-switch"><u>1-2-Switch</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/16/arms-review"><u>Arms</u></a> need for proper playing. They’re also way more comfortable to grasp for gaming marathons. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Joy-Cons really shine during multi-player games, as both the left and right controllers feature a full set of buttons, an accelerometer, and a gyro sensor, so they can be used independently of each other. There are even handy straps for a bit more to hold onto while playing this way.

That’s why a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/13/nintendo-switch-pro-controller-review"><u>Switch Pro Controller</u></a>  is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-switch-controller">best Switch controller</a> for extended play at home or on the go. Not only is this traditional, ergonomic controller easier to hold, but it also sports better triggers and bumpers while giving you back HD rumble and motion controls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller works wireless and can charge using a USB-C cable. If you're worried about keeping charge, it boasts a 40-hour battery life, so you’re set for an all-day gaming marathon. The larger, more tactile triggers and buttons, along with Nintendo's signature D-pad should improve your gameplay while giving a retro feel. It even supports Amiibo with its NFC chip.

And sometimes, a finger isn’t always the ideal tool for the job, as they can leave oils and grease on the screen, making it harder to see over time and requiring more cleaning. Plus, your hands can get in the way of what you’re playing, especially where precision is concerned. So, if you plan to play games centered around the touch input on the Nintendo Switch Lite, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/scribblenauts-showdown"><u>Scribblenauts Showdown</u></a>, a stylus comes in handy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Adonit Mark is an affordable stylus, coming in under $10, that will register just like a finger on a touchscreen but won’t leave the same residue. This stylus features a mesh tip to hold up better over time than some of the soft, silicone-tipped styluses you might find. Its triangular shape ensures the stylus doesn’t roll away from you, while the durable aluminum body means you’ll be good to toss it in your bag or wherever. Since the Nintendo Switch Lite’s display is in charge of registering the touches, the Adonit Mark also doesn’t require any power, making it a portable partner for your Switch Lite.</p></div><p id="what-to-look-for"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What to look for">What to look for in a Nintendo Switch Lite Accessory</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most important thing you should keep in mind while shopping for Switch Lite accessories is that all accessories designed for the original Switch won’t necessarily work with Nintendo’s smaller handheld system. The Switch Lite is simply a different system that has smaller dimensions, integrated controllers, a lack of motion, and IR sensors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some cases and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-battery-cases-for-the-nintendo-switch">battery cases</a> for instance are just going to be too large. While the Switch Lite will fit, it’ll probably jumble around with all the extra space inside. The same thing goes for screen protectors unless you’re ready to cut them down with a box cutter or some kind of knife, they’re going to be too big for the Switch Lite’s smaller display.</p><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/07/nintendo-switch-lite-preorder-720x405.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, most if not all of the Labo Nintendo has released isn’t going to work with the Nintendo Switch Lite. This is especially true of any pieces of Labo designed to hold the screen by itself like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/16/nintendo-labo-vr-kit-review">Labo VR Kit</a> or Labo Piano, due to the system’s slightly different proportions and its inability to detach the controllers. While you may be able to use other Labo kits like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-labo-vehicle-kit">Vehicle Kit</a>, it wouldn’t quite be the same because you can’t connect the Switch Lite to a TV.</p><p id="faq"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="FAQ">Nintendo Switch Lite Accessories FAQ</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Does the Switch support Bluetooth? </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch consoles have always supported Bluetooth pairing with controllers, but until recently, there was no support for Bluetooth audio. Luckily, if your Switch’s system version is updated to 13.0.0 or higher, Bluetooth audio should work without the need for an adapter. That means you can use the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-wireless-earbuds"><u>best wireless earbuds</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-wireless-bluetooth-headphones"><u>headphones</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-bluetooth-speakers"><u>speakers</u></a> with your Switch. However, Bluetooth microphones still aren’t supported. Take a look here for more information about <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/my/support/switch/accessories/bluetooth_audio.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>how to connect via Bluetooth to your Switch</u></a>. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">What comes with the Switch Lite? </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch Lite is also on the lighter side when it comes to included accessories. This Switch model doesn't connect to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-for-gaming"><u>gaming TVs</u></a>, so a dock and HDMI cord aren’t in the box. The Joy-Cons don’t detach either, meaning you won't find straps or a grip for them. Instead, you’ll only find a USB-C charger. That’s why you’ll want to grab some of the accessories we’ve listed to make the most of your console. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">When do Nintendo Switch Lite accessories go on sale?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Generally, the overall <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-times-to-buy-a-nintendo-switch">best times to buy a Nintendo Switch Lite</a> console are also the very best times to buy Switch Lite accessories.
