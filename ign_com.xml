It's the best deal we've seen on this beloved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy game</a> all year, including its discounted price during Prime Day in October.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Get Splendor Now for $19.99</h2><div catalogid="0641b3cd-4fd7-4dd4-904b-3f20f273a1e5" id="212898"><div id="212898" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Splendor Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Splendor was released in 2014 and has remained a popular title among board game enthusiasts since. The beauty of Splendor lies in its simplicity: It's a great game to bust out a family gathering for players of all ages and experience levels due to its intuitive ruleset and average 30-minute playtime. Once you get a handle on the basic premise of the game, there's room for plenty of strategy to come into play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an economic engine game designed around the concept that players are working to build an increasingly powerful economy to buy cards that earn them points (dubbed "prestige" in the world of Splendor). In good ol' Renaissance fashion, your currency is none other than gemstones, which are represented by multi-colored tokens. The end goal is to reach 15 prestige points, which you accumulate by purchasing cards worth variable amounts of points with the gems you collect. If you're spending your gems on cards wisely, you might even become eligible for a visit from a noble, which gives you a massive point boost. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Splendor is a race to the finish line among players, but this game doesn't make it easy. Whether it's your rival reserving a card you had your eye on or someone hoarding the already-limited supply of tokens that you needed to purchase the card you've been saving up for, there's plenty of curveballs along the way that make game sessions with friends and family ripe with tension and necessitate thorough planning. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the price you're paying, this is a fantastic board game to snag this December, whether it be for your own collection or a fun gift that you can count on arriving before the holidays. If you'd rather pick it up in-person, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qrp7on?object_uuid=5eb6e6ed-179d-4100-b430-2408a5e13bfd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target is also selling Splendor at the same price</a> for Cyber Monday.

While those lines have blurred, Cyber Monday remains the top event for online-focused retailers like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. Even traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart roll out exclusive online-only offers. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-best-cyber-monday-deals-2024">Switch</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-playstation-cyber-monday-deals-2024">PS5 deals</a> are also now live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the same deals from Black Friday normally return for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/cyber-monday">Cyber Monday 2024</a>, including some that sold out or expired. Retailers often stagger their inventory, reserving stock for each major sale event. This means Cyber Monday will bring back popular deals alongside brand-new, never-before-seen offers. But, most importantly, Cyber Monday is the final day of the Black Friday sale season, with most the deals going with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelance writer who works with the Guides and Commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 2, 2024 9:10 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
