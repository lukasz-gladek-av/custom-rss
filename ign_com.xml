            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/vote-for-your-favorite-games-of-2024-in-the-ign-peoples-choice-tournament<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A bracket of 64 titles will crown one ultimate winner.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">From iconic names like Indiana Jones and Final Fantasy to indie sensations like Balatro and Animal Well, 2024 has provided gamers with a variety of incredible experiences. IGN is in the process of picking our game of the year, but now you have the chance to have your voice heard too in the IGN People’s Choice Tournament.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With our partners at Truth, we’ve selected 64 of the best titles of the year to be placed in a bracket and randomly sorted into groups. They’ll go head-to-head, with the winner moving on to the next round and the loser being eliminated. As the rounds progress, the competition will get tougher, until there’s only one title left standing as the fan-voted Game of the Year. If you’re familiar with how March Madness brackets work, it’s the same concept.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Tournament Schedule and How to Vote</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Voting will take place on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/igndotcom/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>IGN’s Instagram</u></a> starting today, December 18. We’ll post the matchups to our Instagram stories around 3 p.m. ET / 2 p.m. CT / 12 p.m. PT, and you’ll have 24 hours to vote. The 32 winners will move on to the next round, where the process will repeat. Here are the dates when each round will be posted (around the same times listed above), so make sure to check back on our Instagram stories to continue voting for your favorite games:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Round 1: December 18</li><li>Round 2: December 20</li><li>Round 3: December 23</li><li>Quarterfinals: December 27</li><li>Semifinals: December 30</li><li>Finals: December 31</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Which Games Are Grouped Together?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As we mentioned earlier, the bracket placements of the 64 games we selected were randomized. They were split up into four groups, like the regions of March Madness. Group 1 is led by some heavy hitters: Helldivers 2, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. But they’ll have to go up against breakout indie Animal Well. Plus, three popular sports games: Madden NFL 25, College Football 25, and MLB The Show 24. And you can’t look past the beautiful visuals of Unicorn Overlord and Infinity Nikki.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Group 2 is led by the excellent Silent Hill 2 remake, but it’ll face stiff competition from a trio of RPGs — Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. There’s also heralded remasters and remakes from Nintendo with Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. And we can’t leave out the technical marvel Senua’a Sage: Hellblade II, or another standout indie in Lorelai and the Laser Eyes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Group 3 ended up stacked with three games that have been cleaning up during awards season: Astro Bot, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and Black Myth: Wukong. They’re joined by an eclectic group of competitors. There’s entries from massive franchises in Star Wars Outlaws and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 (which will face off against each other in Round 1). There’s games from other long-running series in Tekken 8 and Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble. There’s the latest version of sports franchises in EA Sports FC 25 and NBA 2K25. But also some notable new IPs with Stellar Blade and Slitterhead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding things out, Group 4 is also full of some big names. First, there’s indie darling Balatro, which has also done very well for itself this awards season. But it’ll have to get through two huge RPG sequels in Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth and Dragon’s Dogma 2, as well as a popular RPG remake in Persona 3 Reload. And they’ll be up against several family-friendly opponents in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, LEGO Horizon Adventures, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and The Plucky Squire. Not to mention the often overlooked Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown and surprise hit Enshrouded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can see, this year is going to be a hotly contested race. So make sure you head over to Instagram to vote for each matchup and help determine which games will move on and which will be sent packing. It’ll all build to a big reveal of the fan voted Game of the Year. Happy voting!</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-weakens-pikachu-ex-boosts-mewtwo-ex-and-adds-celebi-ex-as-a-brand-new-threat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket has received its first major card drop since launch with the Mythical Island Themed Booster, and the long-established meta has already been shaken up to push Mewtwo ex up, Pikachu ex down, and the new Celebi ex potentially above them both.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">The Genetic Apex meta saw four decks stand above the rest</a>. Pikachu ex was perhaps the best, followed or rivalled by Mewtwo ex. Charizard ex followed in third place, and Starmie ex in fourth. Of these, Mewtwo ex and Starmie ex have received a slight boost, while Pikachu ex seems to be the target of a meta shift as many new cards are poised to take it down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-reveals-mew-led-set-coming-next-week-and-60-million-download-milestone">Mythical Island is built around Mew</a>, the mythical relative and predecessor of Mewtwo. It therefore includes many Psychic type cards, but it's not the headliners like Mew ex itself that provide a bump but instead a new Item called Mythical Slab.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/slab-1734544821806.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look at the top card of your deck. If that card is a Psychic Pokémon, put it into your hand," reads the effect. "If it is not a Psychic Pokémon, put it on the bottom of your deck."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Card draw effects are incredibly important in card games as they essentially reduce the random chance element and allow players to pull exactly which cards they need to execute winning combos. It's the reason why every deck in the game runs Poké Ball and Professor Oak; they let players draw cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mythical Slab is another card draw exclusive to Psychic types, so including it in a Mewtwo ex deck is practically an instant bump. It lets players dig through their deck quicker and pull the likes of Ralts, Kirlia, and Gardevoir to execute the deck's best play, removing some of the random chance that's perhaps the Mewtwo ex deck's greatest flaw.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/vap-1734544859120.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Starmie ex, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-cower-as-mythical-island-expansion-threatens-to-make-misty-even-stronger">a new Vaporeon variant threatens to make the infamous Misty card even more powerful</a>. It allows the transfer of Water Energy between Pokémon, essentially meaning Misty coin flips of three or more are no longer wasted and can boost myriad Pokémon at once.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex, being a Fire type deck that's weak to Water, could see some reduced play as a result of this boost, but is otherwise largely unaffected by the Mythical Island expansion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's Pikachu ex which seems to take the most hits, with several of the new cards seemingly designed with taking Pikachu ex down in mind. Pidgeot ex, for example, despite being weak to Electric Pokémon like Pikachu, has an ability that works directly against Pikachu ex's.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/pidgeot-1734544909048.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A three Colorless Energy attack does 80 damage plus 20 more for each of its opponent's Benched Pokémon. Unlike other meta leaders Pikachu ex relies on having a full Bench, as its attack does 30 damage times the number of Pokémon there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stacking the Bench against Pidgeot ex will only lead to disaster though, with Scattering Cyclone doing 140 damage in that instance, enough to take down Pikachu ex in one hit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Colorless card can also take down Pikachu ex in one turn too. A new Tauros card is fairly simple, being a basic Pokémon with 100 HP and a single attack called Fighting Tackle. It does 40 damage for three Colorless Energy, unless its opponent is an ex Pokémon, in which case it does 120 damage.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/tauror-1734544948531.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This won't take down Mewtwo ex in one hit, nor Charizard ex, nor Starmie ex, but is just enough to take down Pikachu ex in one hit. These Colorless cards likely won't fit into the aforementioned meta decks but they will fit into the also popular anti-meta category, in which players build decks with the sole purpose of taking down the likes of Pikachu ex and Mewtwo ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-meta-may-have-a-new-champ-as-celebi-ex-dominates">what's emerged as a potential new threat to the meta is Celebi ex</a>. It can be combined with a new Serperior card that doubles the value of all Grass Energy, allowing Celebi ex to do up to 100 damage with just one energy, up to 200 with two, up to 300 with three, and so on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-first-major-update-as-mythical-island-expansion-drops">Mythical Island just arrived yesterday</a>, December 17, and the meta will no doubt continue to chop and change as time goes on and players discover new combos.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/celebi-1734544986791.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The main game arrived around six weeks earlier on October 30 and is a certified hit for Creatures Inc. and The Pokémon Company, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">having earned an estimated $200 million in its first month</a> across more than 60 million downloads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This huge amount of money comes as Pokémon TCG Pocket follows the standard mobile and free to play game model, flooding players with rewards in the first few days before soon drying up, with spending real world money the only real way to re-experience that early thrill outside of the occasional set drop like this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing Genetic Apex, the first set of cards which totals 226 officially but also contains 60 rare alternate art cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take players not spending money around two years according to one estimate</a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-player-reveals-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-complete-the-first-set-after-spending-1500">those looking to make it rain can wrap up the collection after dropping around $1,500</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
