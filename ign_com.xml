            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/baby-steps-punishes-serial-cutscene-skippers-with-a-28-minute-long-cutscene</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baby-steps-punishes-serial-cutscene-skippers-with-a-28-minute-long-cutscene.1320112/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It's a cutscene about nothing.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Baby Steps, the literal walking simulator recently released from Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and Bennett Foddy is silly, absurdist, and often just plain weird...in a good way. But one of it's goofiest gags is one that few players are likely to see: a 28-minute long cutscene that plays only if you successfully skip all or most of the game's other cutscenes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I say successfully, I do mean that. Skipping cutscenes in Baby Steps isn't just a matter of pushing a "Skip" button. Each cutscene skip forces you to play a weird little minigame of sorts with the Skip button, where it's almost as though the Skip button is trying to actively stop you from doing the skip. You can fail these skips too, and if you don't skip enough of them, you won't trigger the ridiculous, lengthy reward (or punishment) that ensues from being a skip-a-holic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The cutscene itself occurs when Nate visits Moose at the cabin at the end of the game. If the player skipped everything else but doesn't skip this last cutscene, the cutscene proceeds with Nate breaking the fourth wall to tell Moose about the cutscene skipping, and express that he's not really up to performing the final scene as a result. The two sit outside and chat as their actors, Cuzzillo and Foddy, shoot the breeze about everything from broccolli sandwiches to the fact that their characters can't raise their eyebrows individually to the challenges of audio recording under a busy flight path. At one point they try to take a nap, but that proves awkward, and they get sidetracked talking about mold, the human need to pee as a useful writing device, and localization struggles. They repeatedly lambast the player's incessant cutscene skipping and their feelings about it, then grow frustrated when the player doesn't skip this particular one, forcing them to continue recording dialogue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cutscene goes on for around 28 minutes of silly, inane discussion between the two before they finally decide it's important to show the credits and a cat starts meowing at them to hurry things along. Beautiful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players who just want to watch all this without skipping every other scene can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQahQACsvPU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find the whole thing on YouTube</a>. Whether or not you see this sort of thing as a punishment or a reward for your or someone else's abuse of the skip button is entirely up to you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baby-steps-review">gave Baby Steps a 9/10</a> calling it "an infuriating ordeal of intentionally awkward physics that’s brutal, unbelievably stupid, and downright awesome."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Here are our picks.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save On Tech And Toys At Target</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Kicking off with a doozy, you can get this <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q4DAqD?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>LEGO Star Wars Darth Vader Helmet</u></a> for under $50 with Target’s deals. It’s an 834-piece build, so is ideal for intermediate builders, and shows off arguably the most iconic helmet in cinematic history (seriously, who comes close other than Stormtroopers?).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Target also has some Apple tech deals. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao6eNY?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Apple Watch Series 10</u></a> is down to just over $300 now that the Series 11 is here, and considering the new model adds very little on top of what the Series 10 offers, it’s well worth that if you want a device that’s a seamless extension of your current iPhone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up for Apple, there’s a $100 discount on the ridiculously powerful <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmOVL6?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>iPad Pro M4</u></a>. I’ll be honest, there’s a good chance an M5 version arrives in a few weeks, but this is a phenomenally powerful tablet that can take advantage of iOS 26’s new features like multitasking and more Mac-like features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Apple deals continue, with half off the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8MwE?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Beats Studio Pro</u></a> over-ear headphones, and 32% off the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2VOd?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>AirPods Pro 2</u></a>, although expect the latter to get cheaper for Black Friday since the third-generation ones are out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, you can get a compact <a href="https://zdcs.link/QdpMl6?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Anker Power Bank</u></a> for $14.99, saving around $10 - ideal for charging your phone while out and about. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up Target is running a <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBDd54?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Buy 2, Get One Free</u></a> promotion across books, movies, music, and uh, Funko Pop figurines. If you’ve been lacking in any of those areas, now’s the time to splurge, with books like the recently released Alchemised, movies like Moana 2 and Thunderbolts, and more included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5 gamers can pick up some first-party exclusives on the cheap, too. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aM8Vg0?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>The Last of Us Part 1</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjld0?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Gran Turismo 7</u></a> both see 56% discounts, dropping to $29.99 each.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally (ha!) the <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwnv0?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Final Fantasy Limit Break Commander Deck</u></a> is now cheaper than MSRP. This is the one that’s tended to hold its value since launch in June, and it’s now reduced by 22% - and you don’t even have to be a Target Circle member for this one, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.
