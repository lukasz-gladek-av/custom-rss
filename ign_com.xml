            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-exclusive-astro-bot-sells-15-million-in-2-months<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> has sold 1.5 million copies so far, Sony has announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of its latest financial results, Sony revealed that the PlayStation 5 exclusive platformer sold 1.5 million as of November 3, just shy of two months after its September 6 release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Astro Bot, developed by Sony-owned Team Asobi and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment, is the sequel to 2020’s Astro’s Playroom and the third game in the Astro Bot series. It launched to critical acclaim, with IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">Astro Bot review</a> returning a 9/10. We said: “A fantastically inventive platformer in its own right, Astro Bot is particularly special for anyone with a place in their heart for PlayStation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Astro Bot’s sales aren’t up there with some of Sony’s big hitters (Helldivers 2 remains the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with an incredible 12 million sold in 12 weeks), it compares favorably to other recently released family friendly platforms. In Europe, launch sales of Astro Bot were 34% higher than those of 2022’s Sonic Frontiers and 52% bigger than those of 2020’s Crash Bandicoot 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To put Astro Bot’s sales success into more recent context, Sega’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sells-1-million-units-on-launch-day-sega-reveals">Sonic x Shadow Generations hit the one million sold mark on its launch day of October 25</a>, according to Sega. But that game launched across multiple platforms and generations, whereas Astro Bot is a PS5 exclusive. Astro Bot sales will surely continue to grow as we head into the crucial holiday shopping season and gamers look to buy a PS5 or the recently released PS5 Pro.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">All 173 PlayStation Characters in Astro Bot - Easter Eggs</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Asobi has continued to support the game since launch with a number of updates that have added speedrun challenge levels and new cameos to rescue. At launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot"><u>Astro Bot</u></a> featured 173 bot cameos from PlayStation games past and present (check out IGN’s feature, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-every-playstation-character-easter-eggs"><u>Astro Bot: Every PlayStation Character - Easter Eggs</u></a>, for more).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-dev-says-we-really-respect-the-choice-of-each-publisher-amid-final-fantasy-cameo-absence">iconic Final Fantasy characters were conspicuous by their absence</a> — an omission fans were quick to pick up on in the context of Final Fantasy's long-standing association with PlayStation. That means no Cloud from Final Fantasy 7, or any other character from the famous role-playing franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/empire-of-the-ants-single-player-campaign-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">This is not the anthill to die on.</h2></div><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be nice to look at, but Empire of the Ants’s single-player campaign is outright terrible and dull. It’s around 12 hours worth of missions that pivot between being pointlessly easy – due to a passive enemy AI that doesn’t even know how to use powers to buff its troops, which is crucial to success – to obnoxiously difficult on a dime, and it doesn’t let you save mid-mission. Most infuriatingly, there’s one where nine waves of enemies spawn and attack from all directions, and you instantly fail if you lose control of a single one of the seven nests you have to defend – so many that it’s impossible to upgrade them all with effective defenses. That last wave is a doozy, too, which meant I had to replay it from the start multiple times just to overcome the final challenging moments where they come in large enough numbers to be a threat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mixed in with those combat missions are absurdly tedious ones where you only control your single ant as you hunt for tiny bugs – which are usually very effectively camouflaged thanks to the realistic art style – spread across a big map. You’re guided only by a non-directional proximity sensor, so you have to run in circles to triangulate each bug. There are also “stealth” missions that don’t actually care if you’re detected as you scan enemy legions (dying has basically no consequences either), and these similarly amount to running around a map looking for things. Sometimes you’re told to catch butterflies or fireflies that fly away when you get close – the only way I found to do it was to wait for them to repeat their scripted movement pattern and land right in front of me, and that is exactly as much fun as it sounds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering you can climb any object and walk on the ceiling, it’s surprising that only a couple of the missions make any use of this ability at all, and those that do are mostly the boring, non-combat variety. (There was only one mission where my units fought upside-down, which was very funny because the corpses of dead ants rained down.) Similarly, the only thing Empire of the Ants does with its impressive sense of scale is give you a few objects – like a glass bottle or a toy giraffe – to run around, picking up little glowy things as you explore them. I’ll grant you that this does remind me of how I’ve seen real ants figure out if an object is something they want to eat, but I don’t think ants are doing this for fun, and I am not having much fun doing it either. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don’t think ants are doing this for fun, and I am not having much fun doing it either.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You aren’t forced to do all of these missions to complete the campaign – you select missions by speaking to quest-giving ants in a sequence of hub areas that serve as a sort of menu – but I don’t recommend any of them, or the campaign in general. The nicest thing I can say about it is that it’s not all that buggy (other than… you know).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other thing you do in these hubs is talk to ants. I haven’t read the books Empire of the Ants is based on, but if the Wikipedia synopsis is anything to go by this game’s story isn’t even close to following them because there are no human characters or secret ant weapons to make it remotely interesting. I’m going to assume that its numerous conversations about how your nest is threatened by termites and other visually identical ant species or floods don’t do the novels justice. Even the ant civil war that breaks out is over almost as abruptly as it begins, ensuring there’s no substance there either.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">While Empire of the Ants’s nearly photo-realistic world looks incredible at first glance, its boring and annoying real-time strategy campaign is the ant-ithesis of that. Combat missions are mostly trivially easy because the AI doesn’t seem to understand crucial mechanics, and those that aren’t are obnoxious because you can’t save mid-mission to replay the tough parts without trudging through the easy setup; Meanwhile, all of the non-combat missions are tedious searches for needles in haystacks and the story fails to make ant politics intriguing. It’s easily the worst single-player campaign I’ve played in years.</p></div></div><div><div data-cy="review-content"><p>awful</p><p>Pretty to look at but painfully dull and frustrating to play, Empire of the Ants's single-player campaign has none of the depth of the multiplayer and packages bad AI with boring missions and a meandering story.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
