Chief among them is the feeling that Path of Exile 2 isn’t rewarding enough, something GGG acknowledged is a problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the major problems that players have been experiencing is feeling that the game is not rewarding enough,” it said. “This is an area that we have to be very careful when adjusting because it's very hard to reduce drops if we increase them by too much.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, GGG felt that rare monsters were not rewarding enough, especially in the endgame where unique monsters are less common. GGG also saw that the reward players received for the increased difficulty of rares wasn't lining up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, it's doubling the rarity bonus per rare mod, increasing the quantity bonus per rare mod by 10%, and increasing the chance of rare monsters inherently having more modifiers as players progress through endgame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These changes will cause rare monster rewards to naturally scale up as you get to higher levels because the number of mods a monster can have increases throughout the campaign and into endgame,” GGG explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In addition, many other forms of map juicing will indirectly cause rare monsters to have more mods as well, increasing the rewards of these other mechanics too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, GGG is changing the game to make sure each map has a minimum number of rares, which will also increase the average number of rare mods and thus increase drops further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another major issue GGG has identified is outlier "unlucky" drops. “A single unique boss dropping badly, especially early on can significantly affect your character,” GGG admitted. Changes here include no more than 50% of a unique monster’s drops can be gold, and act bosses and map bosses will now always drop at least one rare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, GGG is making dodge roll changes after players complained about being trapped in by monsters. “While it is intended that monsters are able to trap and kill you, we felt that the frequency of this was a little too high,” GGG explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GGG has posted <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611708" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the first set of patch notes for these changes</a>, with more to come as they’re rolled out. Check out the patch notes for 0.1.0c below (you will need to restart your client to receive the client changes in this patch).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-dev-already-hitting-skills-with-big-nerfs-it-is-better-to-do-this-early-before-it-feels-obligatory-to-use-the-skill">GGG is already nerfing a number of Path of Exile 2 skills</a> it’s deemed to have “unacceptable balance.” And in a fresh tweet, the developer said it plans to nerf Raging Spirits so it can only summon five Raging Spirits per cast at all levels. They will also no longer be able to be spawned from triggered Fire Skills. Players are already calling on GGG to give all a full character respec opportunity as a result.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>In an upcoming hotfix, we'll be making it so that Raging Spirits can only summon 5 Raging Spirits per cast at all levels.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-patch-5-makes-big-balance-changes-completely-reworks-blocking-weapons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Patch 5 is out now across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, and it makes a number of significant balance changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot to pick through, but the highlight here is a complete rework of Blocking weapons, which were deemed useless by players ever since Space Marine 2’s record-breaking September launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, by blocking enemy attacks, the player accumulates up to three stacks of melee damage buffs. Attacking while having those stacks of buffs will spend them and will result in massive AoE Damage discharge. Check out the patch notes, below, for more detail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/128-patch-5-0-obelisk-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on publisher Focus Entertainment’s website, game director Dmitriy Grigorenko explained that Fencing weapons will remain good versus limited numbers of enemies, Balanced weapons will be good versus big crowds, and Blocking weapons are now “damage dealer” type weapons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Accompanying this change is a buff to all melee weapons, with normal melee damage increased across the board. Developer Saber Interactive hopes this change will give combat less reliance on the Parry -&gt; Gun Strike flow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s a big one: Space Marine 2’s Operations mode now has an Extermination Bonus, which increases the amount of XP players get in PvE missions “if they are zealously exterminating enemy waves.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea here, according to Grigorenko, is to incentivise players to not skip encounters (Space Marine 2 Operations players have a habit of skipping entire chunks of the PvE missions to finish as fast as possible and get on with the grind), without punishing those who want to skip, and make the game less grindy in preparation for new features coming down the line, such as Prestige Ranks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I’d like to pick out this one change I am particularly happy about: Shielded Zoanthrope will now attack much less frequently. Praise the Emperor!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Saber has said it’s happy with firearm balance, but promised minor tweaks in Patch 6. Importantly, a big rework of weapon perks is coming with Patch 7. “Weapons perks are underwhelming compared to class Perks right now, and the issues with some weapons are actually a result of them having a bad Perk tree rather than their basic stats,” Grigorenko explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grigorenko admitted a lot of the Class perks are not as good as we wanted them to be, and some Perk tree choices are really more efficient than others.” Patch 6 will “massively rework” a bunch of lacking Perks to make more builds viable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a big problem with the Grenade Launcher that makes it overpowered, so Saber will look to make changes there in a future patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a big day for Warhammer 40,000 fans, with Henry Cavill’s Amazon film and TV series based on Games Workshop’s grim dark universe finally proceeding to production, and the release of the Space Marine 2 animation as part of Amazon’s Secret Level anthology series. Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-level-review-prime-video-tim-miller"><u>Secret Level review</u></a> for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Saber Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 had “changed everything” for the company</u></a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-spot-chapter-all-but-confirmed-to-get-cosmetic-pack-after-the-dark-angels"><u>Eagle-eyed fans have spotted the Space Marine chapter now all-but confirmed to get a cosmetic pack after the Dark Angels</u></a>, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Update 5.0 patch notes:</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">NEW FEATURES</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>New Operation: Obelisk</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">In this new Operation, you’ll be sent to Demerium and your mission is to rotate a replica of the obelisk to disrupt the flow of energy protecting the Aurora device.

The issue that we saw is that, on higher difficulties, the melee combat relied too heavily on the “Parry -&gt; Gun Strike” flow. This also made Fencing Melee Weapons a universal choice for almost all situations, and we want to give players more options. To try and achieve that, we’ve made the following changes.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>First, </em><em><strong>normal Melee Damage has increased across the board</strong></em><em>, so there will be more options instead of just Parry -&gt; Gun Strike.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Second, </em><em><strong>we are drastically changing how Blocking Weapons work</strong></em><em>. In short, by blocking enemy attacks, the player will accumulate up to 3 stacks of Melee Damage buffs. Attacking while having those stacks of buffs will spend them and will result in massive AoE Damage discharge.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>With these changes, Fencing Weapons will still be great versus limited numbers of enemies, Balanced Weapons will be good versus big crowds, and Blocking Weapons will become ‘damage dealer’ type weapons.”</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Perfect Block</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>All Block Weapons have been reworked with a new mechanic: </strong><em><strong>Perfect Block</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>Adrenaline Surge</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perfectly timed blocks grant up to 3 <em>Adrenaline Surge</em> stacks. <em>Adrenaline Surge</em> stacks greatly increase Melee Damage and are consumed after the next melee attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Attacking with 3 stacks of <em>Adrenaline Surge</em> deals massive AoE Damage, staggers enemies, and restores 1 Armour Segment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note that the right wrist glows in yellow after the Parry, which signifies that the Adrenaline Surge is ready to use.

Here’s what he said at the time:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Witcher 4 has been announced. I can't say anything about it. What we know is that Geralt will be part of the game, we just don't know how much, and the game won't focus on Geralt. So it's not about him this time. We don't know who it's about. I'm excited to find out. I want to know! I have not seen any script yet — I mean, I couldn't tell you if I did. This is the thing, so I could be lying through my teeth. But I'm not. Or am I?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt had long made clear that Geralt's saga had come to an end, meaning a new protagonist was fully expected for Polaris, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-stars-geralt-of-rivia-but-not-as-the-main-character">this was the first confirmation he'd be in the next game at all</a> — and fueled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-4-story-fan-theories-ciri-vesemir"><u>some rampant fan theories</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Only a single teaser image, below, has otherwise been revealed for The Witcher 4, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-dev-confirms-teaser-is-a-brand-new-witcher-school">but it was enough to suggest Ciri will be the protagonist this time around</a>. What's considered the "true" ending of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, thanks to its story being continued in canon comics, sees her become a witcher herself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/23/untitled-2-1648052443071.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Witcher 4 teaser image. Image credit: CD Projekt.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But now, Cockle has revealed those comments raised a few eyebrows at The Witcher developer CD Projekt, and he now insists he has no idea if Geralt is in The Witcher 4, or who the main character is — although he admits that a non-disclosure agreement would force him to lie about it if he did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I did go online and I said something about this and then I got slapped by CD Projekt,” Cockle said. “I don't know how true it is. I went off a rumor. I thought I'd seen somebody from CD Projekt say that Geralt will be in Witcher 4 but he won't be the main character. And I don't actually know if that's true now because they came back and they went, ‘We haven't put anything out there, don't say anything.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So the truth is, the answer to your question is, I don't know what it's going to be. I have ideas. I thought I had an idea what it was. And then I was kind of basically told, ‘We haven't told anybody what it is, so where you got that information we don't know.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it might be from a really really old statement that somebody who no longer works for CD Projekt actually put out about three years ago. So Witcher 4 is a complete mystery to me. I actually don't know.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the interview, Cockle said Ciri as protagonist in The Witcher 4 would make sense, pointing to her ability to travel between worlds. He also reveals that years ago he spoke with someone at CD Projekt about what a future Witcher video game might look like, and discussed a Witcher origin story, among other ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, though, Cockle is keeping his cards close to his chest here. “The truth is I can’t answer the question because I’ve signed an NDA,” he said. “So even if I did know, I’d have to lie to you.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/10/gettyimages-1356685274-1733820615489.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Doug Cockle insists The Witcher 4 is a mystery to him.

As part of its <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-wraps-up-the-third-quarter-of-2024/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>latest financial results</u></a>, the Polish company said that Project Polaris — the first instalment in the new Witcher trilogy — had progressed from preproduction to full-scale production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m proud to confirm that several weeks ago the Polaris team wrapped up preproduction and moved on to full-scale production — the most intensive phase of development,” commented joint CEO Michał Nowakowski. “We are very pleased with our progress on this project, and I wish to thank the team for its dedication.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm thrilled to announce that Project Polaris has entered the full-scale production phase," game director Sebastian Kalemba <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a>. "With new challenges just around the corner, it’s the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what’s on the other side of the coin!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt currently has 400 developers working on Polaris, the majority of its 650-person total development staff. That's down from the 410 reported at the end of July. 64 are working on Orion, the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, 42 on Sirius, The Witcher game developed by The Molasses Flood, and 18 on Hadar, CD Projekt's brand new IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer had indicated it had left Cyberpunk 2077 development behind, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-gets-surprise-update-22-cd-projekt-still-has-some-gas-in-the-tank">the studio plans to reveal Update 2.2 later today</a>, December 10, in a surprise patch release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
