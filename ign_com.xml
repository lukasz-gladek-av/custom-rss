Arriving alongside the ongoing Christmas festivities, every gameplay tweak and cosmetic addition gives players new anime-themed gear and challenges to enjoy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The aforementioned Armored Titan Raid tops the list of additions, with the team behind Attack on Titan Revolution describing it as a two-phase event that tasks soldiers with defending rescue boats while fighting off the plated beast. With this comes new Raid Artifacts, such as the Scars and Rifle, and cosmetics, like the Young Reiner’s Outfit and Marleyan Band.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/attack-on-titan-revolution-1736277317380.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Attack on Titan Revolution Update 2.5 is out now.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fritz rework, meanwhile, includes extra defense and support perk slots with an assortment of smaller tweaks, as well as the skills Founder’s Vengeance, Founder’s Will, and Chaos. As for those new Abnormal variants, Roblox players can expect to fight off the Leader, Rager, Ducker, and Iceburst, with each featuring unique qualities to keep players on their toes. The Leader, for example, stands apart with glowing yellow marks and can buff titans in close proximity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another headline from Attack on Titan Revolution Update 2.5 involves the new Thunderspear gear. The full patch notes detail the obtainment method, which involves reaching Prestige 1 and completing a series of quests, and how the new explosive tools can be used to gain the upper hand in battle. Finally, fans can expect a series of quality-of-life changes, bug fixes, and other smaller, foundational changes to greet them when logging in for Update 2.5 for the first time. Highlights include an automatic detonation setting for Spears, an extension for battle pass 2, and an additional free memory storage slot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Attack on Titan Revolution is kicking off 2025 with more content themed after one of anime’s most popular stories.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tetsuya-nomura-drops-a-cryptic-kingdom-hearts-4-tease-on-birth-by-sleeps-15th-anniversary<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingdom Hearts series director Tetsuya Nomura has shared a cryptic tease for the long dormant <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iv">Kingdom Hearts 4</a> by pointing to the epilogue of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iii">Kingdom Hearts 3</a> and even a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-birth-by-sleep">Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep</a> connection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Kingdom Hearts <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1877279286488678705" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitte</a><a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1877279286488678705" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">r</a> account shared a message from Nomura on Birth by Sleep's 15th anniversary, where he discussed the crossroad scene at its climax.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He then connected some dots for less familiar fans, saying these crossroad scenes have long appeared in Kingdom Hearts and all follow the concept of giving something up to gain something in return. The brief epilogue at the end of Kingdom Hearts 3 was a crossroads scene in itself, and though he doesn't reference Kingdom Hearts 4 directly, he said an explanation of this epilogue is "a story for another time."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When the Lost Masters gather at the crossroads in Kingdom Hearts 3, what is gained and what is lost? That's a story for another time.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Nomura explained: "Crossroads act as an important point of divergence. To trace it right back, the motif was inspired by the well known crossroad myth from American folklore. The story goes like this: A young man makes a deal with the devil at a crossroads, trading his soul for the ability to play the guitar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The first time a crossroads appears in Kingdom Hearts is in Chain of Memories, which is about losing something to gain something. And in fact, all subsequent appearances of crossroads have the same significance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The greatest example is Birth by Sleep, a story where all three protagonists pay a heavy price to obtain something. But wait... When the Lost Masters gather at the crossroads in Kingdom Hearts 3, what is gained and what is lost? That's a story for another time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This tiny, cryptic tease for Kingdom Hearts 4 is the most fans have had in years. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-and-kingdom-hearts-missing-link-announced-at-the-series-20th-anniversary-event">Despite being revealed in September 2022 with a full cinematic trailer</a>, developer Square Enix has since gone incredibly quiet and, in series tradition, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-fans-pine-for-update-on-2nd-anniversary-of-its-announcement">left fans pining for more information</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer showed flashy gameplay with protagonist Sora but Square Enix said this was from an Unreal Engine 4 demo, whereas <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-earts-4-gameplay-visuals-unreal-enigne-5">the actual game will be made in Unreal Engine 5</a>. It's already been analyzed completely too, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-trailer-may-tease-a-star-wars-section">some even think there's evidence of a Star Wars section</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, Nomura has said Kingdom Hearts 4 will, after 22 years and a whopping 18 games, finally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-22-years-and-18-games-kingdom-hearts-4-will-move-the-story-towards-its-end">shift the Kingdom Hearts narrative towards its conclusion</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
