            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-deals-black-friday-what-to-expect-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> is the ultimate season for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals">Xbox deals</a>, whether you’re after classic or newly released games, or upgrades to your setup. This year, major retailers like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-2024-when-will-the-sale-start-this-year">Amazon</a>, Best Buy, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-black-friday-2024-when-does-the-sale-start">Walmart</a> are all expected to offer unbeatable prices on everything from controllers to must-play games, and the deals will only ramp up as we get closer to Black Friday itself. So, what can you expect on the Xbox front this year? Here’s our preview of what to keep an eye out for, and stay tuned, as this season’s deals could be worth the wait.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Xbox Series X|S: Black Friday Console Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, Xbox Series console bundles dominated the holiday sales, especially at Walmart. While <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/11/15/xbox-black-friday-cyber-monday-2023/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft initially offered $50 off</a> select Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, many retailers took things further, rolling out even bigger discounts and bundles – like the Diablo 4 Xbox Series X bundle, which dropped to $439 and made a major splash in the sale season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Black Friday, we’re likely to see similar deals, with Xbox consoles getting solid discounts and even better bundle options. Stay tuned for updates, and check out our guide on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-xbox-consoles-online">where to buy Xbox Series X and S consoles for the latest options</a>, including the new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-galaxy-black-robot-white-xbox-series-x-s">2TB Galaxy Xbox Series X</a> and 1TB Xbox Series S, which could also see holiday discounts.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Last Year’s Xbox Black Friday Timeline</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In recent years, some of the best Xbox Black Friday deals have started surfacing around <strong>mid-November</strong>, with the biggest discounts dropping in the final days leading up to Black Friday. For fans of digital downloads, the Xbox Store typically joins the fray, offering deep discounts on popular franchises and exclusive digital content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2023, Xbox’s Black Friday sales were announced on November 15, kicking off on November 17. <strong>While this year’s offers haven’t been confirmed yet</strong>, we expect a similar timeline and range of discounts. For context, here’s a snapshot of last year’s highlights:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Up to 50% off digital games</li><li>Up to 65% off select Xbox Game Studios titles</li><li>Up to 67% off select PC digital games</li><li>$50 off select Xbox Series X and Series S consoles</li><li>Up to $25 off select Xbox Wireless Controllers</li><li>Free engraving on Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 via Xbox Design Lab</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Every Xbox Game I'd Like to See On Sale for Black Friday</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">With its intense third-person combat and rich Warhammer lore, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Space Marine 2</a> has become a must-play for fans of the genre. A Black Friday deal would make it a fantastic gift option for Warhammer enthusiasts, making it a holiday highlight for any fan of brutal action and immersive storytelling.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Resident Evil 4</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The remake of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-review">Resident Evil 4</a> is still going strong with an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4-ps5-deal">impressive $19.99 price reduction this week</a>. Given its acclaim as one of the best remakes in recent years, an extension or further reduction during Black Friday would be a win for players who haven’t picked it up yet.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic X Shadow Generations</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Just released, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> could also see early Black Friday discounts. Sega has a history of marking down recent titles, as seen with Sonic Frontiers last year. Currently priced at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-on-sale-woot">$39.99 on Woot</a>, we might see an additional price cut soon. Leaker <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">billbil_kun</a> has hinted it could reach around €26.99 in Europe, which could translate to a similar discount in the US.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Elden Ring</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A standout in gaming, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-review">Elden Ring</a> has gained even more depth with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion. This popular game has held its value, but Black Friday could be the perfect chance for a deal on the main game or its complete edition. Any discount would make this one of the season’s most tempting offers.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Star Wars Outlaws</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a0XGle?object_uuid=940e9ed7-11b3-4f68-8cd8-0aabc298a665&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Star Wars Outlaws</a> has received a steady stream of updates since launch, improving performance and gameplay. A Black Friday discount would be a great opportunity for newcomers to explore Ubisoft’s expansive Star Wars universe. With updates driven by community feedback, Outlaws is shaping up to be a thrilling experience for fans of open-world sci-fi games, and a sale could make it even more accessible.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Robert's Favorite Games Played in 2024 (So Far)</h3><p>Everything I've loved playing this year, which also includes some games I revisited, and even some oldies I played for the first time. </p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Xbox Game Pass Black Friday Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a hot question: Will we see any discounts on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-game-pass-deals">Xbox Game Pass during the Black Friday sales</a>? It's a tough one, as we've already seen plenty of unreal discounts on Game Pass in recent months, especially at <a href="https://zdcs.link/aepwy6?object_uuid=940e9ed7-11b3-4f68-8cd8-0aabc298a665&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Woot</a>. But, Black Friday offers Microsoft a unique opportunity to ride the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record">Black Ops 6 wave and launch Game Pass subscriber numbers</a> into the stratosphere. Although it's not for certain, I do anticipate Game Pass getting a discount for Black Friday, and I'm hoping it'll be something like three months of Ultimate for $30, for example. We'll just have to wait and see!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Xbox Controllers: $39 or Less for Black Friday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-series-controller"><u>Xbox Wireless Controllers</u></a> were a hot item last Black Friday, available at a discounted price of $39, up to $25 off the regular cost. We’ve seen a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lenovo-xbox-controller-early-black-friday-deal-2024">similar deal recently crop up at Lenovo</a>, but it often quickly sells out and is limited in what colors are available. If this returns for Black Friday, and consistently stays in stock for all color variants, then this will be the best time to buy.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Xbox Expandable Storage SSDs Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssds-for-xbox-series-xs">Xbox SSD expansion cards</a> are consistently one of the most popular deals console gamers are looking for over big sale events. They're expensive, so everyone who wants one is trying to find it at a reduced price. Looking at recent deals on Xbox-compatible SSDs, we expect to see 1TB cards drop to around $100-125, similar to the recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-1tb-expansion-card-october-prime-day-2024">October Prime Day event</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Xbox Black Friday Shopping Tips</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Before you dive into the Black Friday shopping frenzy, keep these <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shopping-tips-for-black-friday-deals"><u>Black Friday shopping tips</u></a> in mind:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li><strong>Plan Your Spending</strong>: Set a budget and stick to it. Only buy games or accessories you genuinely intend to use.</li><li><strong>Create a Wishlist</strong>: Make a list of the items you want to buy and stick to it to avoid impulsive purchases.</li><li><strong>Compare Prices</strong>: Double-check deals at different retailers to ensure you're getting the best price.</li><li><strong>Act Swiftly</strong>: Exceptional deals may sell out quickly, so don't hesitate to grab them.</li><li><strong>Don't Worry If You Miss Out</strong>: If you miss a deal, it might come back on Cyber Monday or during the next Prime Day.</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for deals right now? Have a look at our roundup of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-playstation-ps5-deals">best PlayStation deals</a> to see the biggest discounts available today. Or, if you'd like to see what's caught our eye on other platforms, have a look at our individual roundups of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">best Nintendo Switch deals</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals">best Xbox deals</a> or our overall look at the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-game-deals">best video game deals</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When Is Black Friday 2024?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual date of <strong>Black Friday in 2024 falls on November 29</strong> this year, but the deals season will begin a lot sooner than that. Leading up to the big event, retailers will begin to open deals online. This usually <strong>starts in the last week of October</strong>, just before Halloween. Each week leading up to the event will slowly roll out more deals, which ultimately leads to Black Friday. Retailers will not reveal their biggest Black Friday deals until the big day, but most general deals will be available well in advance. Walmart, for example, has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-black-friday-2024-when-does-the-sale-start">announced its official sale</a> for November 11 this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.
