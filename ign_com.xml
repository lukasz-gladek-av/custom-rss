The popular game is all about using your imagination to build just about anything out of digital blocks, and LEGO is the ideal medium to bring that into the real world. There are already a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-minecraft-sets">ton of LEGO Minecraft sets</a> out there and more are on the way. Now that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-a-minecraft-movie">A Minecraft Movie is in theaters</a>, Amazon is offering some pretty steep discounts on older sets that are actually really cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although there were some newer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-minecraft-movie-lego-sets-where-to-buy">Minecraft Movie LEGO sets</a> released earlier this year, none of those have gone on sale. If you're a fan of the game itself and not just interested because of the new movie, however, the sets that <em>are </em>on sale are worth a look.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Minecraft LEGO Sets on Sale at Amazon Today</h2><div id="218161" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="928b6967-86f1-42d0-98c5-1e6fd6f3441d"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Minecraft The Sword Outpost</h3></p></div><div catalogid="928b6967-86f1-42d0-98c5-1e6fd6f3441d" id="218162"><div id="218162" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Minecraft The Deep Dark Battle Set</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Although there are other LEGO Minecraft deals available on Amazon, the two options we've featured here are the best overall savings. First there's The Sword Outpost set, which is recognizable by the massive sword backdrop, of course. At just over $30, this is the lowest price we've seen on this set all year and close to the lowest-ever price on Amazon. It also comes with quite a few minifigures, including Skeleton and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Creeper">Creeper</a> mobs. With only 427 pieces, it's fairly easy to put together in an afternoon and can be easily displayed or played with once you're done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second discount we've highlighted here is The Deep Dark Battle Set. At $44.49, this is the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0BBSMSX9Z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest price we've ever seen</a> on this LEGO Minecraft set. This particular set takes you to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Deep_Dark">Deep Dark</a> and offers some cool functionality for kids. There's a knob included in the build that lets you raise and lower the Warden. The tower can also "explode" with a built-in switch. You only get two minifigures with this set, but each one comes with armor and weapons you can equip them with.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">See more popular LEGO Minecraft sets</h3><h2 data-cy="title2">What About the Minecraft Movie LEGO Sets?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There have only been two Minecraft Movie LEGO sets released so far: The Ghast Balloon Village Attack and Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring. Both of these sets reflect specific scenes from the movie and include minifigures of the characters, including Jack Black as Steve.</p></div><div id="215965" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="0f3e36ea-4367-4f3f-80b5-d721970e0438"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Ghast Balloon Village Attack</h3></p></div><div id="215966" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="0f3e36ea-4367-4f3f-80b5-d721970e0438"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring</h3></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 3, 2025 10:00 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="article-subtitle">Not yet available for streaming.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While Super Smash Bros. has taken the path of adding characters from every Nintendo-adjacent franchise imaginable to its roster, Mario Kart has gone the other way by digging deep into Mario lore and adding every single goofy little guy you've ever seen to the line-up of kart racers. Right down to one of the cows populating Moo Moo Meadows in Mario Kart 8.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">THEY REALLY ARE ADDING ANYBODY LMAO <a href="https://t.co/UcvrIXxg57" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/UcvrIXxg57</a> <a href="https://t.co/JJdofUopVe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/JJdofUopVe</a></p>— No Context Super Mario (@SuperMarioOOC85) <a href="https://twitter.com/SuperMarioOOC85/status/1907442715823833568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Moo Moo, or just Cow as they're referred to in the official roster, is getting special attention online from the community. Already, people are drawing up fanart to celebrate this cute, goofy, seemingly random edition to a line-up that, up til now, has largely included the Mario series' most famous and beloved characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They're also, predictably, making all sorts of of memes:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Mario Kart players seeing that Cow racing <a href="https://t.co/7eAN22LWPd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/7eAN22LWPd</a></p>— SwagKirb (@Swag_K1RBY) <a href="https://twitter.com/Swag_K1RBY/status/1907538841852076510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">wanted to let everyone know that this was my first thought upon seeing the moo moo meadows cow in mario kart <a href="https://t.co/CCWZA0nqfL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/CCWZA0nqfL</a></p>— ticky fraggle !

What does this mean, philosophically, for Cow?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's more, does this mean we'll get to see Cow wearing a variety of costumes like the other characters?

Cow was one of our favorite playable characters, and we're excited to find out more about some of the other unlockable weird little guys we've seen on the courses, and potential funky costumes we might eventually see Cow donning.

Included in the 15-minute upload were details about how Season 2 will introduce its new Vanguard, Emma Frost, at launch April 11, as well as Ultron, whose class will be revealed closer to his mid-season launch. Both promise to keep Marvel Rivals fans on their toes with new abilities, but the real changes to how playable heroes will impact matches truly begin in Season 3.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In Marvel Rivals Season 3, which is currently without a release date, NetEase will shift season lengths from being three months long to just two months. It means major content updates will progress rapidly without changing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-promises-a-new-hero-every-month-and-a-half">the team’s initial promise to drop at least one new hero every half-season</a>. So, while you’ll have to wait a month and a half to play as Ultron after Emma Frost launches next week, that wait will be cut down significantly after the hero after that drops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since the launch of Season 1, we’ve been deeply contemplating how Marvel Rivals can continuously deliver fun and engaging experience for you all,” Marvel Rivals creative director Guangyun Chen explained in the Dev Vision video. “During this time, several discussions on social media have certainly added some pressure on us to keep the game as exciting as it has been since December. To a certain extent, we agree.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>With our goal of keeping the audience’s excitement alive just like our opening months, the real adventure with Marvel Rivals is just beginning.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Chen went on to explain that NetEase wants Marvel Rivals “to fulfill everyone’s fantasies about Marvel Super Heroes,” and that means exploring new modes and flooding the scene with a dense roster of varied characters. Following what he called “extensive internal discussions and thorough evaluations,” NetEase will adjust its systems to account for the increased flow of content. More information on how this will affect players will be revealed before the launch of Season 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With our goal of keeping the audience’s excitement alive just like our opening months, the real adventure with Marvel Rivals is just beginning,” Chen added.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-2-ushers-in-the-age-of-ultron-with-hellfire-gala-theme-and-emma-frost"><u>pulled back the curtain on Marvel Rivals Season 2</u></a> just hours ago, revealing that it will soon swap out its vampire takeover theme in favor of a new storyline that focuses on the Hellfire Gala. That means new fancy outfits, maps, and characters are on the way, with more information primed to be revealed in the coming weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals was a smash hit when it launched in December, securing 10 million players in three days. NetEase’s free-to-play superhero team-based PvP shooter launched on December 6 across PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. On Steam the launch was particularly huge, with 480,990 concurrent players. January's Season 1 then drew an incredible 644,269 concurrent players, making Marvel Rivals the 15th most-played game ever on Valve's platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But those concurrents have been on a downward slide ever since, which may have sparked the drastic roadmap change from NetEase. Still, Marvel Rivals remains hugely popular, and is one of Steam's most-played games. The launch of Season 2 will no-doubt prove a shot in the arm, and again with Season 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Marvel Rivals, be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-update-20250327-patch-notes-reveal-new-galactas-quest-easter-egg-and-hero-fixes-coming-this-week"><u>the patch notes for update version 20250327</u></a> as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/there-was-once-an-idea-for-a-marvel-gaming-universe-that-would-tie-all-the-video-games-together-like-the-mcu-but-it-didnt-get-funded"><u>why Disney decided to scrap an idea for a Marvel Gaming Universe</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
