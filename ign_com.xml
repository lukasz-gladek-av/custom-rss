            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Was the Best-Selling Console of 2025 in the U.S. and Is Still Outpacing the Nintendo Switch]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-was-the-best-selling-console-of-2025-in-the-us-and-is-still-outpacing-the-nintendo-switch</link>
            <guid>1413856</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 was the best-selling console of 2025 in the U.S., both in unit sales and dollar sales, selling a total of 4.4 million units in the U.S, and continuing its streak of selling faster than the original Nintendo Switch over the same period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Circana's full-year reporting on the U.S. games market courtesy of analyst Mat Piscatella, and shouldn't come as a shock to anyone. The Switch 2 has been at the top consistently since it launched earlier in the year, amid a period of decline for the steadily aging PS5 and Xbox Series consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 was the best-selling game of last year, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> was the best-selling accessory.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, the U.S. games market reached $60.7 billion in sales for all of 2025, and $7.8 billion in December alone. That's up 1% and 3% year-over-year, respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In hardware, spending was up 9% year-over-year to $5.4 billion for the year, and up 6% year-over-year to $1.2 billion in December. The Nintendo Switch 2, as the best-selling console of the year, managed to sell 4.4 million units, 94% higher than the original Switch at the same amount of time after its own launch, and 35% ahead of the PlayStation 4. It also continues its reign as the fastest-selling video game console hardware platform, with Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mczfshqpik2v" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointing out on Bluesky</a> that the Game boy Advance remains the fastest-selling hardware platform overall after seven months on sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over in software, December spending was up 3% to $5.9 billion, with subscription services seeing the biggest increase of 24% year-over-year. Overall full-year spending was only up 1% year-over-year, with subscription spending increasing 20% offsetting declines in everything else except mobile spending.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Battlefield 6 was the best-selling game of the whole year, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 took the crown in December, despite its precense on Game Pass making its impact on Xbox much harder to tally. Fortnite saw the highest total active users across PlayStation and Xbox in 2025 of any game, with over half of all active users on the two platforms playing Fortnite at least once.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for other games, the top five sellers for the full year should shock no one who's been watching the numbers all month: after Battlefield 6 was NBA 2K26, Borderlands 4, Monster Hunter: Wilds, and Call of Duty Black Ops 7, again noting that Call of Duty was a Game Pass Day 1 title. The rest of the list was populated by a series of expected sellers, with some standouts such as The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered coming in at No.9, Elden Ring: Nightreign at No.14, Pokemon Legends: Z-A at No.17 (though Nintendo doesn't report digital sales, so it's possible this would have been higher), and Split Fiction at No.19. Grand Theft Auto V clocked in at No.20 as players await the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, probably this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, just looking at December, standout games including Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which launched into No.7 overall for the month, and Flight Simulator 2024, which released on PlayStation in December and shot from No.114 in November to No.16 last month. Over on PC for December, both Elden Ring and Elden Ring: Nightreign saw jumps likely due to the new Nightreign DLC.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">December 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li><li>NBA 2K26</li><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>Madden NFL 26</li><li>EA Sports FC 26</li><li>Pokemon Legends: Z-A*</li><li>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (NEW)*</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza*</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>EA Sports College Football 26</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>Flight Simulator 2024</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li><li>Kirby Air Riders*</li><li>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2*</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">Full Year 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>NBA 2K26</li><li>Borderlands 4</li><li>Monster Hunter: Wilds</li><li>Call of Duty Black Ops 7</li><li>Madden NFL 26</li><li>EA Sports College Football 26</li><li>EA Sports FC 26</li><li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>MLB: The Show 25*</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Elden Ring: Nightreign</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>Pokemon Legends: Z-A*</li><li>WWE 2K25</li><li>Split Fiction</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/sovereign-tower-preview-hands-on-with-this-unique-arthurian-round-table-management-rpg</link>
            <guid>1413811</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Text-based games, management RPGs, and visual novels – of whatever kind – rarely make the most exciting previews. It's just not easy to build a rich interest in the world and characters of a story you can only get the slightest taste of. I'm very pleased to say that a few hours with Sovereign Tower broke that trend entirely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whosoever turns the key in the giant magic lock on the tower becomes king. So, as the mystically-appointed lord of the tower, your poor faceless wanderer becomes a very important person overnight in what developer Wild Wits calls a "story-rich, Round Table management RPG." It's an entertaining concept that draws its characters and dialogue equally from fantastical tradition and modern life. Couple that with a deliciously detailed art style and a sense of what's most entertaining to do in both management games and visual novels. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's enough to sell it, I think, but it also has some nice surprises and a weird little twist on the genre as a whole. I had a pretty darn good time with it, and I'm looking forward to more.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">King of the Castle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In each turn of Sovereign Tower, you have to do two things: accept audiences, then assign knights from your round table to various quests. Taking audiences is a simple concept: Sit on the throne and deal with problems people bring you. The decisions you make there can alter the path of the story, bring up new quests for your knights, or avoid problems. They'll also affect the sovereign's standing with the realm's four factions: the Nobility, People, Merchants, and Scholars. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some problems go away if you just throw money at  them, and the taxes you get at the start of every cycle can pay for some of that—but those are the same taxes you use to pay for stuff like cool new swords and horses and magic potions, so do you really want to spend them on boring stuff like bridges or whatever? Probably not.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sovereign Tower Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That sounds pretty normal, but it's the weirdos that show up to need things from you or to join your kingdom that make it memorable. I encountered a stinky jester, proud emissaries unable to admit they couldn't solve their own problems, clever peasants, annoying nobles, and even an assassin. Talking with them solidifies the personality of your blank-slate Sovereign, raising their stats in Audacity, Tyranny, Wisdom, and Kindness to unlock alternate decisions in future events.</p><p>It's the weirdos that show up to need things from you or to join your kingdom that make it memorable.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Knights are the flavor that'll really have to carry the game, and from what I saw they might do it. I met a huge guy that acted like a child, a very fancy boy, an extremely overdramatic guy, a nice lady who loved forest critters, the most goth knight ever, and even a straight-up actual wolf. Each of them had their own unique little events and dialogue that popped up from time to time, each of which affected your sovereign's relationship with them. They also had history to learn, as well as more straightforward stats, all of which affect their performance on missions.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-08-1769118770111.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Figuring out which knight would be best for each quest was an actually interesting choice. Equipment like a specific horse to ride, a sword to use, or a magic potion can give them temporary stat boosts, but it's often the bonuses or penalties from their personality traits that make the difference between a failure and success or between mere success and an outstanding victory. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example if you're doing something that's a bit of public relations? Probably should send the more charismatic knight, but not the really arrogant one. Watching each knight's background and figuring out which of the little highlighted keywords apply to the current mission is a fun bit of understanding the characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there's a real penalty for failure. Your knights each have an armor score, which if it goes to zero means that knight's, well, dead and gone. Your blacksmith can only fix one knight's armor each cycle—so you need to be reasonably sure that the task you're sending a knight on is one they can at least survive if they fail.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Shining Armor</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">None of the characters, nor the entire game as I saw it, would have nearly as much personality without the visual art on display in Sovereign Tower, and I've got to take a moment to run through the influences and elements that make it up. Starting with the simple choices of colors to draw from: The warm pastels, earth tones, and jewel tones are lovely, then they're combined with copious golden shades and tints to express lighting. It's a palette of colors that's something between stained glass or rich watercolor on thick paper.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-14-1769118784850.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The characters are drawn with a lot of emotion and movement, too, for what are otherwise relatively flat portraits. You can feel the shrug in how Urusla stands, for example. You can see the carefree attitude in the angle of Angelica's head. And, well, everything about Gideon tells you exactly who he is and how he behaves. It's not just great illustration work in that you can feel the motion, it's that you can immediately start to feel who the characters are just from how they look.</p><p>The characters are drawn with a lot of emotion and movement, too, for what are otherwise relatively flat portraits.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's clear that these are artists who understand how to work their chosen medium, and if you'll put up with me for a nerd moment, it is deeply reminiscent of the Art Nouveau period in design from France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Particularly the advertisements, posters, and calendars of justly-famous artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_Mucha" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Alphonse Mucha</u></a>. It's a fitting choice, too: Mucha's work often used the kind of medieval romantic and even fairytale themes that Sovereign Tower seems to use in its stories—I imagine he'd approve of being the inspiration here.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-03-1769118800769.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I think that's where I'd place this whole game's artistic style, too: It's a blend of medieval fantasy and Arthurian romance setting, the art of Mucha, and the writing of a wryly clever modern comic book. There's basically nothing to dislike in that.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Clever Twist</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not a surprise to people who like this kind of game that there are going to be secret events and pathways through the story to uncover, as well as desperate outcomes and painful prices to pay when choosing poorly at certain decision points. I found that Sovereign Tower must have more than a few, since I managed to stumble into at least two hidden story outcomes while playing just by assigning an unexpected or suboptimal knight to a specific quest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The frustration with these kinds of events, however, is that they can give you unwanted outcomes or change the story when you weren't expecting them to or were aiming for another outcome. The only choice you've got at that point is often to play the entire visual novel over again just to see a new path or the immediate consequence of a tough choice.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-02-1769118819660.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The real good choice that Sovereign Tower makes is to have a built-in do-over mechanic. See, there's a demon that lives in a cage in the tower basement, which I'm sure isn't scary or plot-relevant at all because the demon helps you do something very useful: Step back in time. Don't worry—the demon assures me this is because it has absolutely no bad intentions and is bound to help you—much like all the other magical things that live in the tower.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the demon's help you can turn back time, especially when some choice you've made would lead to a disastrous end. I expect you'll also be able to use the power to avoid the worst ends in the game, and I'm betting most players will want to use it at least once or twice to avoid making whatever NPC they've chosen to romance not mad at them about something. There's also the hint, given in the trailer and screenshots for Sovereign Tower, that you'll be able to use the demon's power to unlock alternate dialogue in situations you've seen before—tagged with an "Omniscience" stat that surely won't upset or alarm people who don't realize you're time travelling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, from the art and the writing, I'm pretty intrigued by Sovereign Tower and it's going on my list of games to watch out for. Sure, the game mechanics are pretty simple, but when the story and characters are interesting in this way I'm glad the game rules are getting out of the way to let me entertain myself—failing and succeeding on my own terms.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/sovereign-tower-preview-hands-on-with-this-unique-arthurian-round-table-management-rpg]]></content:encoded>
