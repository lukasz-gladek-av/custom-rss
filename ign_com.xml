            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford has said the inbound Borderlands 4 Day 1 patch “does a lot,” amid concern about the performance of the looter shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford responded to concern about Borderlands 4’s pre-release performance on PC from some users on <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1964424122861064640" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X / Twitter</a>, confirming not only that there’s a Day 1 patch on the way, but that it sounds pretty much essential to play the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 has an official release date of September 12 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, with the Nintendo Switch 2 launch following shortly after. Fans will be keen to jump in as soon as possible, making the Day 1 patch an early hoop to jump through.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the Day 1 patch, playing Borderlands 4 on older hardware won't miraculously unlock "buttery smooth performance," Pitchford added. It should be expected that Borderlands 4 is “unplayable” if you’re trying to use a PC below min-spec, he said, and, generally, playing new AAA games on older hardware won't achieve impressive results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the comment in full:</p><blockquote>The Day 1 patch does a lot! That said, the expectation for using a below min-spec machine should be that the game is unplayable. That the game runs at all on your system is a miracle. That you can get 55 - 60 fps out of heavy combat is actually incredible given how the engine and what's going on under the hood. Your specification doesn't indicate if you're on SDD or HDD, but that could also explain some of the hitching. It's a big, bold, new, seamless world and I'm sorry to say that older hardware may not provide buttery smooth performance for the latest gen AAA games, as has always been the case since the dawn of PC gaming.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A significant portion of the PC gaming audience play on low-end hardware. Indeed, just last month the developers of Battlefield 6 told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-dev-says-a-significant-number-of-users-played-the-game-below-the-minimum-recommended-specs-as-ea-points-to-the-importance-of-weaker-hardware" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> they saw a "substantial number" of open beta players on or around the minimum recommended specs, with a number of users even playing below the minimum spec.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you wait for Borderlands 4 to launch, be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/on-borderlands-3-in-our-worst-hours-it-sometimes-felt-like-parody-gearbox-explains-borderlands-4s-more-grounded-story">IGN’s recent interview</a> with narrative director Sam Winkler, lead writer Taylor Clark, and managing director of narrative properties Lin Joyce to learn more about why the team decided to create a more grounded story this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
