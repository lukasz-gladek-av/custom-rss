            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Per Krafton, the three removed executives allegedly would have been eligible for 90% of the $250 million bonus promised to staff.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The ongoing drama around Subnautica 2's delay and its team's upheaval continues, with the company Krafton issuing a lengthy public statement today accusing the studio's leaders of having "abandoned responsibilities" on the game, alleging they focused on personal projects rather than fulfilling their contracted roles and suggesting the game's delay is their fault.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the published statement sent to press, which we've reprinted in full below, Krafton claims it made "multiple requests" to Unknown Worlds founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire to resume their responsibilities as game director and technical director respectively, but claims they both declined. "In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, KRAFTON asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project," the statement reads. "KRAFTON believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Krafton also makes reference to a reported $250 million bonus that was promised to the development team, which would have paid out just a few months from now if it hit revenue targets. Per Krafton, 90% of this bonus was intended to go directly to Cleveland, McGuire, and former CEO Ted Gill prior to their removal from the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement concludes with Krafton promising "fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees...and we reaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The full content of the statement is as follows:</p><blockquote>To Our 12 Million Fellow Subnauts,</blockquote><blockquote>— <strong> Inevitable Leadership Change Driven by Project Abandonment–Despite Holding 90% of Earnout for Themselves</strong></blockquote><blockquote>First and foremost, we sincerely thank you for your continued support, passion, and unwavering dedication to Subnautica. We wish to provide clarity on the recent leadership changes at Unknown Worlds, a creative studio under KRAFTON.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Background of Leadership Change</strong></blockquote><blockquote>KRAFTON deeply values Subnautica’s unique creativity and immersive world-building. To provide fans with even better gaming experiences, we acquired Unknown Worlds, fully committed to supporting Subnautica’s future success. We collaborated closely with the studio’s leadership, who were central to the creation of the original Subnautica, to foster the optimal environment for a successful Subnautica 2.</blockquote><blockquote>Specifically, in addition to the initial $500 million purchase price, we allocated approximately 90% of the up to $250 million earn-out compensation to the three former executives, with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2.</blockquote><blockquote>However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them. Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. KRAFTON made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, KRAFTON asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.</blockquote><blockquote>KRAFTON believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule.</blockquote><blockquote>The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume.</blockquote><blockquote>We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership’s conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>KRAFTON’s Full Support for the Dedicated Development Team</strong></blockquote><blockquote>To uphold our commitment to provide you with the best possible gaming experience, we made the difficult yet necessary decision to change the executive leadership. Subnautica 2 has been and continues to be actively developed by a dedicated core team who share genuine passion, accountability, and commitment to the game. We deeply respect their expertise and creativity and will continue to provide full and unwavering support, enabling them to focus solely on delivering the exceptional game you deserve.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>KRAFTON’s Commitment to its Promises in Rewarding Employees</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Additionally, KRAFTON has committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees who have continuously and tirelessly contributed to Subnautica 2’s development. We believe that the dedication and effort of this team are at the very heart of Subnautica’s ongoing evolution, and we reaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised.</blockquote><blockquote>Fans will always remain at the center of every decision we make at KRAFTON. Moving forward, we promise transparent communication and continued efforts to sustainably develop and expand the beloved Subnautica universe.</blockquote><blockquote>Honoring your trust and expectations is a core tenet at KRAFTON. We are committed to repaying your patience with an even more refined and exceptional gaming experience.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Subnautica 2's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-developers-entire-leadership-team-replaced-in-shock-move-krafton-said-will-bring-renewed-energy-and-momentum">entire leadership team was replaced last week</a> with former Striking Distance CEO Steve Papoutsis by owner Krafton, and the game was delayed to 2026.

In a statement to IGN at the time, Krafton claimed the delay was a response to playtester feedback, and had nothing to do with "any contractual or financial considerations."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I have always loved jigsaw puzzles. They are the perfect combination of relaxation and challenge that just seems to fire off all the right neurons for me. But it wasn't until fairly recently that I got really into collecting puzzles. Because of this job, I spend a surprising amount of time browsing Amazon deals and have found that puzzles are discounted almost every month. So naturally, every time there's a big sale I end up buying at least one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no surprise that Amazon is having a huge puzzle sale once again for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/amazon-prime-day">Prime Day</a>. This is the biggest collection of jigsaw puzzle deals I have seen all year and the discounts are very tempting. I'm doing my best to limit my spending this year, but this sale might just break me. If you're interested in picking up some cheap puzzles yourself, I've gathered some of the best options below. You can also check out all of the Prime Day puzzle sales by clicking the first link I've featured below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Puzzle Deals at Amazon Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has had a lot of different types of puzzle sales and this one is sort of mish-mash of all of them. That means that some of the options I've featured here are lightning deals, some have coupons, and some are just straight up discounts (like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theory11-jigsaw-puzzles-and-playing-cards-prime-day-2025">theory11 puzzles</a>). The last sale like this I covered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-has-stacking-discounts-on-cool-1000-piece-puzzles-today">included some complicated stacking coupons</a>, but thankfully none of that is necessary this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">best puzzle brands</a> are included here, including popular Ravensburger puzzles. You can usually judge the quality of the puzzle by both the brand and the price, so some of the cheaper options I've listed here might not be as nice as the puzzles that cost $15 or more. The extra amount you pay is really just for the extra thickness of the cardboard used so you don't get any really flimsy pieces.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What's the best piece count for jigsaw puzzles?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're new to the puzzle game, you may be wondering what size puzzle you should get. Most jigsaw puzzles that are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzles-for-adults">targeted at adults</a> or teens can range anywhere between 300 and 5,000 pieces. There are some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/largest-jigsaw-puzzles">much larger puzzles</a> that go way beyond that, but unless you're looking for a massive challenge, I'd suggest you stick in the 300 to 1,000 piece range. One of the most common piece counts for adults is 1,000 pieces, but a 500-piece puzzle can be just as fun to put together with half the pieces. Deciding which puzzle size is right for you is more about how much time and space you have to actually put it together.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Consider a Puzzle Table or Board</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're serious about puzzling like me, I'd suggest also looking into picking up a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-tables">decent puzzle table or board</a>. Having a dedicated space to put your puzzles together will save you a lot of stress. I have a dedicated puzzle area in my home office right now and I'm able to leave it and come back to it easily without worrying about pieces disappearing or taking up the entire dining room table for weeks at a time. Jigsaw puzzling should not be a stressful activity and being able to dedicate a space or pack it up when you aren't actively puzzling can help maintain that level of leisure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Day has a lot of deals on puzzle tables, boards, and storage accessories right now. If you're interested in picking something up for yourself, here are some of my top recommendations. All of these make for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-gifts">great gifts for any puzzler</a> in your life as well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Board Games Are Also on Sale Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to all of the puzzle deals, it's also worth noting that there are some pretty incredible <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-deals-prime-day-2025">board game deals for Prime Day</a> this year. Here are some of our top picks below:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jacob Kienlen is a Senior SEO Strategist and Writer for IGN.

Considering you are reading this on IGN right now, there’s a strong chance that hearing “Balatro” instead fills you with images of poker hands and Ben Starr dressed in clown make-up as Jimbo, the star of last year's breakout title that has taken the gaming world by storm (and was nominated for IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-winners-the-full-list">Game of the Year 2024</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you have spent hours in the game or are just interested in jumping in and seeing what the hype is all about, the Nintendo Switch version of Balatro is currently $19.99 – down from $29.99 – as a part of Amazon’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-2025-sale-top-deals-live">Prime Day sale</a>.</p><p id="balatro-special-edition-switch"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Balatro Special Edition (Switch)">Balatro Special Edition (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="2ed53419-10a0-4555-b252-6b19b2d22951" id="225015"><div id="225015" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Balatro Special Edition (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In Balatro, you earn points by playing various Poker hands in an effort to score high enough to complete a string of levels. The better you do, the more money you have to spend on upgrades. These upgrades can improve the bonuses you get from different kinds of hands, like two-of-a-kind or straights, augmenting your playing cards with special properties. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's most notorious feature is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/balatro/Every_Balatro_Joker">special Joker cards</a> that impart unique multipliers depending on what cards you play. It sounds more complicated than it is, and by the time you complete a run or two, you will get why this game is so popular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Made by a single developer, LocalThunk, Balatro has taken home numerous awards since it first released on Steam in February of last year, and one of the biggest indie game hits in recent memory. In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/balatro-review">review</a>, Simon Cardy said, “Remarkably approachable with complex systems waiting for those willing to lose themselves to it, Balatro successfully assembles the infinitely fun gameplay loop that every great roguelike sets out to create.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you're a Balatro pro looking for a new platform to play the game on or just looking for a new game on your Switch, I can't recommend this deal enough! </p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">More Prime Day Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year's Prime Day sale features <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-deals-amazon-prime-day-2025">tons of discounts on physical games</a>.
