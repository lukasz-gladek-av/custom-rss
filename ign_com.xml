            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nintendo-switch-2-will-improve-switch-1-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-23-new-details-release-date-price-gamechat-and-more">The Nintendo Switch 2 is finally here</a> and as previously reported the Switch 2 will be largely backwards compatible with Switch 1 games. However, there appears to be a concerted effort from Nintendo to introduce specially enhanced versions of Switch 1 games to the Switch 2. And these seem to go beyond just a graphical boost and framerate bump.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What Games are Playable on Switch 2?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As Nintendo breaks down, there will be primarily three types of games playable on the Switch 2. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/Switch_2_Games_List_-_Release_Date,_Price,_and_Exclusives">Native Switch 2 games</a> that are developed for the system and cannot be played on the original Switch. Compatible Switch 1 games whose cartridges can slot right into the Switch 2 and be played natively on the console. And Switch 2 Edition games which are Switch 1 games that will receive new features and performance enhancements when played on Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This doesn’t include classic games that are available through Nintendo Switch Online which includes a library of games from the NES, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and now GameCube.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>So What Comes in a Switch 2 Edition Game?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The main takeaway from the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct is that Nintendo appears to be trying to throw in a little extra for anyone playing a Switch 2 Edition of a Switch 1 game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, Super Mario Party Jamboree was a Switch game and the Switch 2 Edition will come with a new suite of content called Jamboree TV that will take advantage of the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, Switch 2 microphone, and the Switch 2 USB-C camera that will be sold separately.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Along with upgraded resolution up to 1440p in TV mode and better frame rate, there will be new minigames and online functions as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which will be a cross-gen game, will support mouse controls with Joy-Con 2, and multiple display modes like Quality Mode which runs at 60fps in 4K when docked, or 1080p at 60fps on handheld; or Performance Mode which runs a 120fps in 1080p when docked, or 120fps in 720p in handheld mode. All modes will support HDR.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other Switch 2 Edition titles will get new story content like Kirby and the Forgotten Land’s Star-Crossed World add-on, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-72-new-game-details-mario-kart-9-the-duskbloods-and-more">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom</a> will gain additional support for the Zelda Notes service in the Nintendo Switch App that will give you guides and game help.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some games, like Pokemon Legends: Z-A will only feature performance and resolution bumps as part of the Switch 2 Edition label.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>When are the Switch 2 Edition Games Coming?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 is set to be released on June 5, 2025 and that’s around when the first batch of Switch 2 Edition games will arrive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will get Switch 2 Editions on the day of the console’s launch on June 5, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch 2 Editions for Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV will arrive a little later on July 24, 2025. Same for Kirby and the Forgotten Land’s update which will arrive on August 28, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither Metroid Prime 4: Beyond of Pokemon Legends: Z-A have release dates yet so both Switch 2 Editions are scheduled for sometime in 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>How Much Will Switch 2 Editions Cost?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That depends. If you don’t own the Switch 1 version of the game, then you can purchase the Switch 2 Edition at retail, which will be distinct thanks to the new red-colored physical game case. The digital versions will also feature a prominent Switch 2 logo so you know you’re buying the right edition for your Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you own the game on Switch 1 and want the upgrades that will be added in the Switch 2 Edition you will need to purchase an upgrade pack from Nintendo. The upgrade packs will be available at select retailers, the official My Nintendo Store, and Nintendo eShop. However, Nintendo has not revealed how much an upgrade pack will cost just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some upgrade packs, like the upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom will be included in a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. This is the same membership that gives Switch owners access to online features and the classic library.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 Zelda Nintendo Switch Editions</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So there you have it, that’s everything you need to know about the Switch 2 Editions of a game. We’ve detailed previously how Nintendo is making the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-is-making-the-jump-to-switch-2-as-easy-as-possible-for-everyone">jump to the Switch 2 fairly seamless</a> thanks to its backward compatibility stance, and it looks like Nintendo is looking to bolster its launch library with improved versions of Switch classics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Nintendo Switch 2 check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">all the news announced during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-price-confirmed">how much it costs</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-start-time">when pre-orders go up.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

So it's not a gamification of a movie,” he told IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from the ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there together to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for a release date, though, the jury is still out on that one.
