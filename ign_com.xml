            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">That matches its excellent Black Friday discount as well.</h2></p><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation’s Direct store is holding <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-launches-a-brand-new-promotional-sale-on-ps5-games-accessories-and-more"><u>a huge sale on PS5 games</u></a>, accessories, and more, helping you fill out the gaps in your collection, and one of the big beneficiaries of this is Kratos himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">God of War’s latest mainline entry, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok"><u>God of War Ragnarok</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-launches-a-brand-new-promotional-sale-on-ps5-games-accessories-and-more"><u>has been discounted by a whopping 71% at PlayStation Direct</u></a>, dropping to just $19.99, while Best Buy is matching the price as well. </p><div id="235681"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235681" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>God of War Raganrok</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That's $50 in savings, and well worth picking up over playing via PlayStation Plus (at least in my opinion), especially if you want to take your sweet time with what is a genuine masterpiece.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game picks up after the events of the 2018 reboot of the series, which took Kratos from Greek mythology to his new life, where he’s raising his son, Atreus. After revelations about the place of both in the wider pantheon, Ragnarok is packed with unforgettable moments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In IGN's review, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">Simon Cardy awarded the game a 10/10</a>, calling it an “enthralling spectacle to behold”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Impeccable writing, pitch-perfect performances, knockout action – it’s a complete work of art from top to bottom. Reflecting its core themes, it's everything a sequel should be: respectful of its legendary lineage, but not afraid to take it to exciting new places.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Couldn’t have put it better myself, and now’s a great time to jump on board ahead of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-trilogy-remake"><u>the remake of the Ghost of Sparta’s earliest adventures,</u></a> which were recently confirmed to be in development (but are likely some ways off yet). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kratos isn’t alone, either. Other discounts include almost 30% off of 2025’s Ghost of Yotei, essentially marking its first sizeable discount, as well as deals on the likes of Helldivers 2, Stellar Blade, Spider-Man 2, and many more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are even controllers on sale, including the limited Death Stranding 2 pad - but you'll likely want to move fast for that one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.</p></div></section><div><h3 data-cy="title3"><svg data-cy="icon-logo" viewBox="0 0 76 24" title="IGN"><title>IGN Logo</title><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M5.38 7.65a7.85 7.85 0 0 1 2.26-2.26c.13-1.18.31-2.26.52-3.21a10.605 10.605 0 0 0-6 6c.95-.22 2.03-.39 3.21-.52M16.34 5.36v.02c.9.59 1.67 1.37 2.27 2.27 1.18.13 2.26.31 3.21.52a10.627 10.627 0 0 0-6.02-6.01c.22.95.4 2.02.54 3.2M7.64 18.62c-.9-.59-1.67-1.37-2.27-2.27h-.03c-1.19-.14-2.26-.32-3.19-.54 1.07 2.75 3.26 4.95 6.01 6.02-.22-.95-.39-2.03-.52-3.21M18.64 16.35h-.03c-.59.9-1.37 1.67-2.27 2.27v.03c-.14 1.17-.32 2.25-.54 3.19a10.59 10.59 0 0 0 6.03-6.03c-.94.22-2 .4-3.19.54M10.04 0h3.9c.85 1.85 1.2 4.59 1.3 5.52.04.22.06.43.06.63L12 9.11 8.7 6.15c0-.17.02-.35.05-.55.1-.95.43-3.75 1.29-5.61M8.7 17.83c0 .17.02.35.05.55.1.95.43 3.75 1.29 5.61h3.9c.85-1.84 1.2-4.59 1.3-5.52.04-.22.06-.43.06-.64L12 14.87l-3.3 2.96ZM6.16 8.68c-.17 0-.35.02-.55.05-.95.12-3.75.45-5.61 1.31v3.9c1.84.85 4.59 1.19 5.52 1.3.22.04.43.06.64.06L9.11 12 6.16 8.7ZM24 10.02c-1.86-.86-4.66-1.19-5.61-1.29-.2-.03-.38-.05-.55-.05l-2.96 3.3 2.96 3.3c.2 0 .41-.02.64-.06.93-.11 3.68-.45 5.52-1.3v-3.9Z"></path><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M42.83 13.9V10h10.45c1.06 0 1.93.86 1.93 1.92v4.63c0 2.38-1.91 4.36-4.33 4.36h-6.69c-4.96 0-8.97-4-8.97-8.94s4.04-8.95 8.98-8.95h10.36v4.11H44.2c-2.67 0-4.86 2.17-4.86 4.84s2.16 4.83 4.86 4.83h6.91v-2.91h-8.27ZM33.86 3h-4.07v16.02c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.15V3M74.37 3.01h-2.18v13.81s0 .08-.03.11a.29.29 0 0 1-.24.14c-.09 0-.16-.04-.25-.15L64.83 4.93a4.347 4.347 0 0 0-3.72-2.11h-.07c-2.39 0-4.32 1.93-4.32 4.32v11.88c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.17V7.14s.02-.09.04-.13a.29.29 0 0 1 .24-.14c.09 0 .18.03.24.14l6.88 12.07c.76 1.27 2.12 2.05 3.69 2.05h.07c2.39 0 4.32-1.93 4.32-4.32V4.92c0-1.05-.85-1.91-1.91-1.91"></path></svg>Recommends</h3></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-20-dollars-ps5-playstation-sale-better-than-black-friday]]></content:encoded>

The developer said it believed the "large number of gameplay videos" now floating around the internet — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-faces-uphill-battle-to-stop-resident-evil-requiem-leaks-as-ending-spoilers-and-videos-appear-online"><u>some of which contain huge spoilers and clips of the game's finale</u></a>, which IGN verified as legitimate — originated from copies obtained "through illegal means."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in a <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/2025040184614728119" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>message</u></a> posted to Twitter/X and translated by machine (which means there may be some inaccuracies or missing nuance), Kamiya reflected on how spoilers also impacted the release of Resident Evil 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm sure the final developments of [Resident Evil 2] were also exposed in a weekly photo magazine…" he wrote. "For your own selfish satisfaction, you trample on the feelings of the users who were looking forward to the game, as well as the feelings of the creators who put all their effort into making it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a despicable act that destroys the happiness of everyone, and deserves a thousand deaths... May you be cursed to never be able to play games again..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom stressed the posting of these videos constitutes copyright infringement, as well as generally being "an act that offends other customers." However, the publisher seems somewhat limited in what it can actually do in response, suggesting it will simply delete the videos or issue "warnings."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, we don't have long to wait now, as Resident Evil Requiem's February 27 release date is but a few short days away. "After getting hands-on with a total of about four hours of Resident Evil 9 Requiem at this point, and sharing that experience with colleagues, I’m more excited for the series than I have been in recent memory," IGN wrote after going <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-second-take-preview"><u>hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem</u></a> recently. "It’s the old mixed with the new, but all in a modern package with two protagonists I already like a lot."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
