We’ve all been there.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Friday is the perfect excuse to add this gem to your PS5 collection. The $29.99 price tag makes it one of the better deals we’ve seen for a highly rated recently released game.

To redeem a code, first enter the hub world and look for the area labelled <strong>Codes</strong>. It's shown in the image above and can be found between the Raids and Challenge areas.</li><li>When you arrive, walk up to the shrine below the Codes sign.</li><li>As you approach the shrine, the codes bar will automatically appear.

The first is that the code was inputted incorrectly. Make sure you have the code inputted exactly as it is in the Active Codes section above. You can even copy and paste codes directly from this article over to Roblox if you want to make sure you’re inputting them correctly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other possibility is the code has expired or you’ve already used it. If your code has been used, a message will appear in the bar reminding you that the code's already been activated. If the code has expired, it'll show up as invalid, meaning its no longer available to use.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Get More Anime Royale Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to hunt down some extra Anime Royale codes, make your way over to the game's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/animeroyale" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Discord server</a>.
