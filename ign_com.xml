            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Evidence of an under-wraps third expansion for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> continues to mount, with one report now pointing to a possible 'Dune-style' location for the new adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Word of a fresh DLC for the beloved 2015 blockbuster RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-3-secret-expansion-rumors-swirl-after-cd-projekt-hints-at-new-content">began bubbling up in earnest last month</a>, fuelled by a set of reports from insiders and apparent teases by developer CD Projekt that it had something secret in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, a report by <a href="https://pl.ign.com/wiedzmin-3/69405/news/wiedzmin-3-nowe-dlc-zabierze-nas-na-pustynie-ujawniamy-nasze-informacje-sprzed-lat-i-rzucamy-nowe-sw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN Poland</a> has said its local sources have been aware of potential plans for several years, and that — initially at least — its developers had expressed a keen interest in exploring Zerrikania, an exotic desert region to the far east of The Witcher 3's current map.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/08/rtg-wi-manticoreschoolv1-02-pdf-01-05-2026-01-59-pm-dw43-960-1767875123667.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Illustration of Zerrikania from The Witcher's TTRPG. Artwork by Bogna Gawrońska and Marek Madej.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While IGN Poland cautions that this information dates back several years, it also goes on to list a string of reasons why Zerrikania makes a lot of sense for the expansion, due to various hints at a Zerrikanian Manticore School in previous expansion Blood and Wine, and references to the region made by other characters. The same school is also a part of The Witcher's tabletop RPG — as seen in the artwork above.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Separately, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> report has given a more black-and-white reason why this expansion is likely real and expected to launch in 2026: because there's currently a gap in CD Projekt's employee incentive program target indicative of the company launching something expected to earn significant money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Eurogamer notes, CD Projekt doesn't really have anything else expected to fit the bill, with The Witcher 4 not set for launch until 2027 at the earliest, and Cyberpunk 2 after that. Work on a new IP is also ongoing, but even further off.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a possibility still that this could relate to some other, smaller Witcher spinoff, but with all the smoke around a Witcher 3 expansion now rising, everything looks to be pointing in the same direction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As "full production" on The Witcher 4 continues, CD Projekt has cautioned fans not to expect its launch in 2026, as the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-still-plans-to-launch-all-3-games-in-the-new-ciri-fronted-the-witcher-trilogy-within-a-6-year-period">plans an ambitious six-year roadmap in which it will also launch The Witcher 5 and The Witcher 6</a>. Before all of that, there's a window this year for even more Witcher, and a fresh slice of content that could potentially help bridge the gap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A new DLC feels like a smart idea to reawaken lapsed interest ahead of the series' next chapter, via extra content sold to The Witcher 3's existing audience of more than 60 million players. This content could be used as a reason to sell the game anew, to bring fresh fans to the decade-old role-player, and potentially set up plot points to be expanded upon in the franchise's eventual sequels. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A ratings board leak has detailed Life is Strange: Reunion, a new game in the narrative adventure series that focuses on the return of fan-favorite character Chloe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details of Life is Strange: Reunion have now been made public by the European ratings board PEGI, which published a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260107182828/https://pegi.info/search-pegi?age%5B0%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B0%5D=&amp;form_build_id=form-zPFbdUs22JjjBl9jvQQJhI4DxddpAjHJlNxhOZ0-1AE&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form&amp;op=Rechercher&amp;page=1&amp;platform%5B0%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;q=life%20is%20strange&amp;release_year%5B0%5D=" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now-deleted plot summary</a> for the game online last night. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reunion's existance had long been rumored among Life is Strange fans clued into the franchise's ongoing development at troubled studio Deck Nine Games. The expectation is that Reunion will be made official in the imminent future, and launch not long after.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Life is Strange: Reunion is particularly notable as it appears to revive (or return) the character of Chloe, the original game's blue-haired best friend (or love interest) that you could sacrifice (or save) depending on your choices. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deck Nine's most recent Life is Strange game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Double Exposure</a>, received a negative reaction from many core fans of the series for returning to the story of original main character Max Caulfield in a reality in which Chloe survived the events of the franchise's first game but did not appear in person. Fans of the pair's romantic relationship option were particularly upset, as Double Exposure explained that the two characters were now broken up, seemingly permanently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Purported leaks from within Deck Nine Games amid this backlash painted a picture of a troubled development, but also mentioned a further game being in the works that did feature Chloe. Reunion certainly seems to be this project — and it will be interesting to see whether its final version feels like it has been shaped by feedback to Double Exposure.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Life Is Strange: Double Exposure Reveal Trailer Screenshots - Xbox Games Showcase 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Chloe Price was Max Caulfield's partner in time," reads a description of the game published by PEGI. "Losing her is Max's greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max's help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other plot details include a character hallucinating on mushrooms, and a scene where a building is on fire with people trapped inside. The game will reportedly begin with a recap of previous Life is Strange entries, in which it sounds like we'll see Chloe during the events of the first game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A digital deluxe version of the game will also be offered, containing additional outfits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Life is Strange: Reunion is yet to be officially announced by publisher Square Enix, but it likely won't be long now. We've contacted the company for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
