It's normally $449.99, but you can get it right now for $398, about $52 off.

If you're intending this to be a gift, Amazon expects it to be delivered well before December 25.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Xbox Series X All-Digital Edition 1TB Console</h2><div catalogid="5fb1e184-2360-4acd-b4d4-15fc3dd712a5" id="212773"><div id="212773" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Xbox Series X All-Digital Edition 1TB Console</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Xbox Series X All-Digital Edition console was released on October 15, 2024.
