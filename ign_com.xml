            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you have time to talk about my lord and saviour, PowerWash Simulator? The unexpected cult hit hooked weirdos like me back in 2022 with its relaxing, satisfying premise; clean dirt off things. Has the sequel, PowerWash Simulator 2, changed the fundamental act of power washing? Has it given new meaning to slowly blasting graffiti off a wall? Will it make you question what it truly means to be filthy in 2025? No. And thank Mr. Clean for that, because it's the simplicity that makes it so satisfying. What you do get is what fans like me - I've got over 400 hours logged in the original - really needed; some quality of life upgrades and lots of new things to wash. I can see myself racking up another 400 hours on this installment easily. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you missed out the first time, it really is as straightforward as it sounds. You are given a vehicle or location to clean, a selection of power washers (they all function the same way, just with varying power), soap, and if a level is feeling saucy, some ladders. You choose your washer, your nozzle (I'm a green girl, yellow for detail work, any one who uses white wasn't loved enough by their mother), and you're left to clean at your own pace, sluicing down sections in whatever way you please. One of the real beauties of PowerWash Simulator is that you can't eff it up. As long as you're blasting water at dirt, eventually things will get clean. Even if you never upgraded anything, you'd still get there in the end. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big headline for the sequel is all the new cleaning jobs to work your way through, and they don't disappoint. There are vehicles like a mobility scooter or a car decorated like a dog; there are buildings like bandstands, public toilets, and grand houses; and there are even new multi-stage jobs where you'll need to clean a particular part of a map to reveal a new area. There is the perfect balance of large buildings and complex structures, for when I wanted to spend a solid hour spraying, alongside smaller vehicles for a quicker splash of dopamine. Less exciting for purists like me is the addition of a home base you can decorate (with items you get to wash first) and some pet cats. I mean, everyone likes virtual pets, but unless I can tie mops to their feet I have no interest in them when I'm busy jetwashing a billboard. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's the perfect balance of large buildings and smaller vehicles to clean. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll understand the beautiful mundanity of this game when I tell you that one of the most exciting innovations is that soap is now free and multipurpose. Not just a blow against capitalism, it actually removes one of the biggest annoyances about the first game. Soap had to be purchased, came in limited quantities, and a different soap was required for each surface. Now you just switch to the soap attachment and any surface, on any job, can be your own personal foam party as it breaks down tough stains. I've gone from a soap dodger to a detergent dilettante. While you're cleaning there are also new icons to help you track down things that still need polishing up, which might sound minor, but as someone who spent hours of their life looking for a 1% speck of dirt on a huge restroom wall, I am hugely grateful for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other new tricks in your cleaning kit similarly make things that were a bit of a fiddle or a grind easier, without letting you skip the work. There's an abseiling rig for large structures like billboards, a cherry picker lift so you're not balancing on ladders to get to hard to reach areas, and a spinning surface cleaner - you know, like school janitors mysteriously push around after hours - to make polishing up large flat surfaces a little less daunting. There are even tiny tweaks, like that tall scaffolding now has a ladder on the outside when you just want to get to the top, no more zig zagging up and down. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">PowerWash Simulator 2 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What's key is that the improvements aren't about speeding you through the jobs more quickly or letting you skip chunks, because the whole point of PowerWash Simulator 1 and 2 is the meditative flow state you achieve just working away at the grime and graffiti, back and forth, up and down, all with the gentle hiss of water accompanying your progress. It's underrated as an ASMR experience, although you will need to pee every 10 minutes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've yet to discover the wonders of jet washing random buildings and vehicles, good news; there's no lore you have to catch up on. The loose story is delivered through text messages while you're working, but you could skip them all without a problem. They usually explain why you're cleaning, for instance, a street sweeper covered in huckleberry jelly, or will give you weird information about the area. There are some nice touches for devotees of the original, too. A shooting gallery has miniature versions of the landmarks you'll recognize, and the chatter will reference the iconic merman statue or strange temple. It's nonsense, but it's nonsense I appreciated. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Line up ladies and gentlemen, and see the rare example of a sequel to a special game that knew just what to tweak, and what to leave well enough alone. The meditative motions of cleaning, the silly sense of humor, and the sense of satisfaction. There's enough here to justify slapping a big old 2 on the end of the title, but the key mechanic and feeling of the first game lives on.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/powerwash-simulator-2-review]]></content:encoded>

The patch notes, courtesy of <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2025/10/expedition-twenty-breach/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the No Man's Sky website</a>, are below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just over a month after the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-sky-voyagers-update-adds-corvette-ship-class-multiplayer-crew-and-tech-that-will-be-shared-with-hello-games-light-no-fire">Voyagers update</a> released for the long-running space game, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-skys-voyagers-update-brings-in-highest-number-of-players-since-2016-launch">the highest player numbers since launch over nine years ago</a>, the Breach update lets players salvage wrecks, unlocking new ship building parts along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hello Games has also improved and expanded ship building “in response to watching players spend so much time in the workshop designing their dream ships,” Hello Games chief Sean Murray said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a new expedition where players will traverse a desolate and abandoned universe to discover what happened to a mysterious abandoned wreck. “Voyaging to the edge of space will be required if you are to salvage from the wreckage of the ill-fated ship and add unique parts and modules to your ship-building workshop,” Murray teased.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Breach expedition also brings players together to explore the strange and rare purple-star solar systems,” he continued. “The planets in these systems are particularly fun to explore with their deeper oceans, incredible terrains and volatile gas giants. It guides players towards the new space wrecks, is a great way to salvage some new rare ship parts, while uncovering a spooky story - suitable for the Halloween season!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">No Man's Sky Breach Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It has been a crazy year for the No Man’s Sky team and we’re so proud and pleased to be able to continue working on this game we all love so much nine years after launch.Seeing so many folks enjoying Voyagers has really inspired us, and we can’t wait for you to see what we have in store in future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Man’s Sky continues to receive free updates even now, years after launch. And it’s clearly keeping players interested. No Man’s Sky launched in August 2016 on PS4 and PC to tens of thousands of negative reviews on Steam, with players complaining about broken promises and a lack of meaningful content, particularly on the multiplayer side. The game quickly settled on the dreaded ‘overwhelmingly negative’ Steam user review rating, a clear sign to anyone who visited its Steam page that something was very wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Guildford, England-based developer Hello Games has continued to update No Man’s Sky over the years, improving player sentiment to the point where it is now considered superb. It took two years to hit ‘mixed,’ then another three to hit ‘mostly positive.’ At the time, five years after launch, Tim Woodley, Head of Publishing at Hello Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-sky-gets-mostly-positive-steam-review-5-years"><u>explained how hard it was to claw back Steam user reviews from such a low base</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Hello Games continues to work on No Man’s Sky, it’s developing its next game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/light-no-fire"><u>Light No Fire</u></a>. It's about adventure, building, survival and exploration together, set on a fantasy planet the size of Earth.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">No Man's Sky Breach update 6.10 patch notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">BUG FIXES AND QOL</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue that could cause the player to be ejected into space if on an internal stair in a corvette while the pulse drive was active.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented the corvette "current flightpath" autopilot from cancelling when the ship came into proximity of a large object such as a Space Station.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented exiting the corvette pilot seat in the Space Station and Space Anomaly when using the Quick Menu in VR.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented stairs in corvettes from being traversable using VR teleport movement.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused weapons to be misaligned with the crosshair when flying a corvette in first person.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the corvette teleporter to persist after the corvette had landed on a planetary surface.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause water to behave erratically when teleporting from a corvette into water.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused newly-assembled corvettes to appear at the wrong scale if another owned Corvette was docked nearby.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause corvette interior doorways to become blocked.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented the corvette Torpedo Launcher module from correctly installing the Rocket Launcher weapon.</li><li>Fixed some corvette structural modules appearing under the exterior decoration category of the build menu.</li><li>Fixed a rare issue that could cause corvette assembly data to be replaced with planetary base data.</li><li>Improved the placement of corvette-class ships when teleporting to a Settlement with a corvette as the primary ship.</li><li>Improved the behaviour of floating exotic creatures, especially in response to being offered Creature Pellets.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could prevent biological monstrosities on derelict freighters from reacting aggressively to nearby Travellers.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could prevent some varieties of hazardous flora appearing on planets.</li><li>Fixed a timing-specific issue that could cause the player's wanted level to get stuck when using the pulse drive to exit planetary atmosphere.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the current primary ship's thrusters to be used for launch fuel calculations when attempting to summon other ships from the Quick Menu.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused refiners to reset their requested output value to the maximum when refining was started.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented the Personal Refiner from automatically starting when an input substance was inserted from the Inventory screen.</li><li>Improved the error messaging when attempting to install duplicate technology in the inventory.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused rain to be audible when standing inside a corvette.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could prevent the Corvette Assembly tutorial from starting in abandoned star systems.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause Exosuit upgrade stations to lose their interaction prompt after a single use, especially in Abandoned Mode.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause misleading instructional text during missions requiring planets with extreme weather conditions.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused some markers to persist unnecessarily in excavation and flora extermination missions from the Corvette Mission Radar.</li><li>Fixed a number of minor messaging inconsistencies in missions requiring the player to prepare ingredients in the Nutrient Processor.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ART AND VISUALS</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue that could cause large waves to abruptly appear and disappear on the surface of water.</li><li>Improved lighting transitions when changing environments -
