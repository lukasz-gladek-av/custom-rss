            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Geoff Keighley’s mysterious The Game Awards teaser statue has sparked rampant speculation about which video game announcement it relates to, but so far the internet is stumped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keighley kicked off The Game Awards hype train last week by tweeting a picture of a demonic monolith located in the Mojave Desert alongside the confusing caption "regal.inspiring.thickness." </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">regal.inspiring.thickness <a href="https://t.co/lY1duUcE1B" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/lY1duUcE1B</a></p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1994609007672381595?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Windows Central reporter Jez Corden <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1995065300539347395" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>took to social media</u></a> to say the tease related to an expansion for Blizzard’s action role-playing game, Diablo 4. Blizzard had said Diablo 4 was set to get an expansion in 2026 (alongside a new ranking system and leaderboards), so an appearance at The Game Awards later this month would make sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Corden’s claim was debunked by Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier, who took to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/geoff-keighley-posts-cryptic-image-with-the-caption-regal-inspiring-thickness-up-not-diablo.1368046/page-7#post-148323163" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a> to insist the statue had nothing to do with a Diablo 4 expansion, although that is not to say Diablo won’t show up at The Game Awards in some form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No idea where Jez is getting that, but this statue is not teasing the Diablo 4 expansion,” Schreier said. “I don't currently plan on reporting what it is, sorry, but it's a good one.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That clarification sparked a new round of speculation, with some fans pointing to the long-awaited reveal of Bethesda’s The Elder Scrolls 6. Alas, according to Schreier, it’s not that, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'll do this one more time because people are getting out of control: no the statue isn't teasing Elder Scrolls 6,” Schreier said, again in a post on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/geoff-keighley-posts-cryptic-image-with-the-caption-regal-inspiring-thickness-up-not-diablo.1368046/page-17#post-148370662" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>. “Now I'm gonna stop responding about this. Unless someone finds me at the JW bar next week and asks really nicely, then maybe I'll answer, depending on how many drinks I've had.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some suggested it might have something to do with Sony’s God of War series, but <a href="https://x.com/LukeStephens/status/1995578668111040811" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming YouTuber Luke Stephens</a> claimed God of War development chief Cory Barlog popped up during one of his streams to rule that out.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what is it then? Given the demonic aspect of the statue, some are suggesting a Doom-related announcement of some kind, perhaps DLC. Some fans are going off the deep end, suggesting everything from Bloodborne 2 to Half-Life 3, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-is-everyone-posting-about-a-half-life-3-announcement-soon">the latter of which has seen rumblings of late</a>. In truth, Geoff Keighley’s statue could relate to pretty much any video game with a demonic or hellish theme. That’s a lot of video games. But based on Schreier’s comments (“it’s a good one”) and all the effort that’s gone into making this tease happen, I have high hopes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Awards kicks off Thursday, December 11, so we don't have long to find out what the statue is about. Let us know your best guess in the comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1994609007672381595" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Geoff Keighley / Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
