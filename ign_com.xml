            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">More leaked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> battle royale gameplay footage appears to have made its way online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Video of this early version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-is-getting-battle-royale-releases-chaotic-teaser-trailer"><u>the upcoming battle royale mode</u></a> poured onto X/Twitter overnight and seems to have been captured from recent BF Labs playtests hosted by the four-studio team at BF Studios. It’s a lengthy look that comes from user @BobNetworkUK, who reports that they have <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1969053836011618398" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>already managed to secure a new Labs account</u></a> after <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1969044830182383929" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>their previous account was disabled by EA</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/lrWKhc8NS0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/lrWKhc8NS0</a></p>— bob. (@BobNetworkUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1968988987684446446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The main leaked Battlefield 6 gameplay making its way around social media is relatively straightforward and not unlike what we’ve seen in other, similar battle royale experiences like Warzone. The player can be seen running around a warehouse, dodging bullets from enemy players as they collect weapons, armor plates, and other tools from nearby loot chests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other clips have also spilled onto platforms like X, including footage of how things like <a href="https://x.com/BattlPULSE/status/1969074216872890471" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>upgrade kits</u></a> and <a href="https://x.com/BF6Meta/status/1969034590879695149" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>custom weapon drops work</u></a>. It’s important to note that none of what we’ve seen so far is final.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 itself still has a few weeks to go before its October 10 release date for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S arrives. BF Studios hasn’t officially announced when exactly the Battlefield 6 battle royale mode will launch, though <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1968006588784058548" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ModernWarzone</u></a> reported earlier this week that its sources expect its release date to be October 28, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and BF Studios are no strangers to leaks, especially when it comes to Battlefield 6. That’s mostly thanks to BF Labs, which has allowed a large number of players to experience in-development content as the developers look for fan feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a topic we made sure to ask Ripple Effect about when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042"><u>interviewing the team</u></a> earlier this month. Most gamers have known that Battlefield 6 is under pressure to deliver for EA. BF Studios told us it knows next month’s new entry marks a particularly important moment for the long-running FPS franchise, too, which is why <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-will-leak-everything-battlefield-6-devs-insist-they-didnt-want-the-game-to-suffer-from-leaks-but-getting-player-feedback-had-to-come-at-any-cost"><u>it doubled down on fan feedback – even if it means it’s sprung a few leaks along the way</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I remember, at one point, making a big presentation that said, 'What will leak? Everything.' Like, we just started with that assumption that things would leak,” technical director Christian Buhl told us. “Now, to be clear, we didn't want things to leak. We weren't seeking leaks, but we knew that the most important thing was to get the game in front of players, get real feedback from players, get real telemetry, real data, and that had to come at any cost, including the fact that things would leak.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Battlefield 6 ahead of its October 10 release date, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6s-battle-royale-footage-has-leaked-heres-what-it-shows-us"><u>another leak from earlier this month</u></a>.

            <title><![CDATA[EA Sports FC 26 Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-26-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-fc-26-review-in-progress.1302774/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the last few decades, soccer (or football, if you’re not from the US like me) hasn’t changed much. Sure, there are new rules, improved tactics, and so much more money involved in the modern game – but at its heart, it's still all about kicking a ball into a goal more than the other team. So how does a series like EA Sports FC improve each year when the sport it’s emulating isn’t introducing massive changes? For me, it’s about quality-of-life updates, and FC 26 has those in spades. You’ve heard the phrase “death by a thousand cuts,” but this is more like “fixed by a thousand pieces of tape.” It’s not that every problem has been solved, and many of the micro issues like confusing player-switching and weird tackle animations have returned from FC 25 – but at least in my early time with it, FC 26 is inching in the right direction in nearly every aspect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A phenomenal example of this is the new gameplay presets. In the past, everyone was using the same gameplay style, whether diving into competitive games in Ultimate Team or trying to win the league against CPU opponents in Manager Mode. This year, EA has split things between two different presets: Competitive and Authentic. With the Competitive preset, you can expect the fast-paced action and smarter AI teammates that you might be used to from previous FC/FIFA games. Meanwhile, Authentic will feel more realistic to what you see on the real-life pitch every weekend. Players are slower, and you need to use your tactical intelligence to get into scoring position. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most important part of this change is that these two options do not impact each other. That means EA can tune Competitive mode however is needed without changing the balance of Authentic mode, something they couldn’t do in previous versions of FC. I’ve only played about a dozen games with each preset so far, but they already feel distinct in a way that is valuable. Players come to FC 26’s various modes for different reasons: Career Mode players want a game that plays as close to real-life a possible, while Ultimate Team and Clubs players want fair and balanced online competition. Those two ideals have sometimes worked against each other in the past, so giving us two totally separate gameplay styles lets EA serve both communities. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s strange about the implementation is that the Authentic preset is restricted to offline modes only. That means you can’t even use it in your Squad Battles matches despite them being the only single-player content in Ultimate Team. It’s something I hope is added in the future, as it feels strange not to include all of the single-player content by default, especially when it does exactly that with the new version of the Season Pass.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This might be the worst version of a Season Pass in a sports game yet.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Before diving into some of the other positive changes, let's go over that Season Pass, as it’s one of the biggest points of contention for me. Last year, EA introduced a paid Season Pass into FC 25 toward the end of the cycle, so we knew this was coming, but seeing it drop on day one does sting. You can ignore it and stick with the free version of the pass, or even earn enough in-game currency to buy it without spending real-world money, but I would argue that this might be the worst version of a Season Pass we’ve seen in a sports game yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The issue with FC 26’s Season Pass is that you’re not just earning rewards for Ultimate Team, where people are already (unfortunately) conditioned to spend money. You’re also earning a ton of rewards for Clubs, Player Career, and Manager Career. The latter is where things really get icky, because one of the big draws for FC 26 is that Icons and Heroes are finally available in Manager Mode. For the first time ever, you can take classic players like Luis Figo, Toni Kroos, and Julie Foudy and put them into your Manager Mode saves. It should be a revelation, but instead, EA made the strange decision to lock many of these players behind the Season Pass.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">FC 26 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are several reasons this is frustrating. The first is that you probably won’t be able to acquire enough XP for them by playing Manager Mode alone. EA might implement more ways for non-Ultimate Team players to earn XP, but with how things are currently constructed, you’ll <em>need </em>to dive into that lootbox opening simulator if you want to finish enough of the pass to claim all of the Career Mode rewards. Even as someone who primarily plays Ultimate Team, this change sucks. I already know how bad FC’s monetization can get, and I hate seeing it expanded to more of the playerbase in a way that feels scummy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As if that weren’t frustrating enough, Career Mode players aren’t likely to earn enough Ultimate Team-specific currency to purchase the Season Pass in that mode alone. That means you’ll need to spend real money to unlock players like Gianfranco Zola, Miroslav Klose, and Park Ji-Sung. Keep in mind, this is only the first Season Pass. If FC 26 continues to lock Icons and Heroes behind future passes, we’ll likely see desirable players like Ronaldinho, Ruud Gullit, and Johan Cruyff tucked behind a paywall as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an unfortunate situation that reeks of EA trying to get even more money out of its playerbase than usual. It’s bad enough that Ultimate Team players are being milked dry, but now you can’t even enjoy your offline Career Mode without feeling the pull to spend money.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Most of the modes feature fun updates to their tried and true formulas.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes this even more painful is that most of the modes feature fun updates to their tried and true formulas this year. For example, the new Manager Live Hub lets you dive into specific challenges and earn new jerseys for your club. These feel like the next step toward a historical mode like the Negro Leagues option in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mlb-the-show-25-review"><u>MLB The Show</u></a>, as you’ll be challenged to recreate moments like Jamal Musiala’s double with Bayern Munich or take a mid-level club like SK Rapid or Strasbourg to European glory. The classic version of Career Mode is still there, but Manager Live gives you a rotating list of challenges that will test your skill on and off the pitch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even Ultimate Team is home to several small yet meaningful changes. Everything from the return of tournaments to the ability to choose the cosmetics on your Evolutions feels carefully crafted to deliver the improvements fans have been asking after for years. We’ll have to wait a month or two to see the impact of the slower Ultimate Team power curve, and I’m hesitant to judge the stability of the servers until they are live for everyone, but my early experience is positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I’m not much of a Clubs player, the new Archetypes have certainly piqued my interest. Without a dedicated group, it’s unlikely I will spend too much time in Clubs, but the Archteype system seems like an improved way to handle progression to my untrained eye. While a meta will surely settle over the mode in the coming weeks, having this clear sense of forward momentum makes me wish I had a group of 10 friends to play with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I have more to play this weekend, but so far FC 26 seems to provide enough quality-of-life changes that I feel more positive about the on-pitch product after a few years of stagnation. However, I can’t help but be annoyed by how heavily monetized every mode is becoming. I’ve always felt it was relatively easy to ignore the pull to spend extra money unless you wanted to compete at the very top of Ultimate Team, but that’s much less true this year. Now, not even the Career Mode players are safe. FC 26 is EA at its most money-hungry yet, and I can’t help but worry where we’re going next.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-26-review]]></content:encoded>

Ultimately, however, the offering was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-multiplayer-mode-was-cancelled-following-its-turbulent-launch">scrapped completely as a result of the game's initially rocky launch</a>, with priority instead placed on ensuring the base game worked as well as possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We really needed to look at what were the priorities for Cyberpunk [after it launched],” Cyberpunk 2077 senior quest designer Philipp Weber said back in 2022. “The priority was that the main experience will run for the people in a really good state, and essentially, the switch of priorities meant that other R&amp;D projects had to go away. With Cyberpunk, we wanted to do many things at the same time, and we just needed to really focus and say, ‘Okay, what's the important part?
