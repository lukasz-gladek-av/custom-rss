            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Everything old is old again.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">2025 was bursting with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-game-of-2025">really cool new game releases</a>: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Death Stranding 2, Ghost of Yōtei, Blue Prince, Donkey Kong Bananza, I could go on. And yet, it seems like the vast majority of players (at least in the US) spent most of their time playing the old hits on repeat, because the five most popular games on PlayStation last year were exactly the same as the year before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, who <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared on Bluesky today</a> the top five most-played games in the US on PlayStation for 2025:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Fortnite</li><li>Call of Duty</li><li>GTA V</li><li>Roblox</li><li>Minecraft</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph">And for 2024:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Fortnite</li><li>Call of Duty</li><li>GTA V</li><li>Roblox</li><li>Minecraft</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph">(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPpjLV77yTs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">They're the same picture</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The layout is different (I guess) on Xbox, with Minecraft and Roblox flipped for 2025, and a slightly more complicated order for 2024: Call of Duty at No. 1, then Fortnite, Minecraft, GTA V, Roblox. But uh, <em>same five games</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a pretty damning indictment of the current state of the industry. As Piscatella said himself almost a year ago on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/lrPeLqcty4I" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinda Funny Gamescast</a>, this is a fairly recent trend. As he explains, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a surge in the video game audience, with huge numbers of people playing games who never had before. As a result, many of the major gaming markets effectively reached a cap on how many new players they can obtain in future years, because everyone was already there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, that capped audience is now playing a smaller number of games overall. Some of that is just because games are getting more expensive. More people are gravitating toward live service games they're already familiar with where they can spend smaller amounts of money for a fun experience on a platform they already own, rather than spend larger amounts of money to try new things on new platforms.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But some of that is simply a natural consequence of the rise of live service. As Piscatella continues to explain, the way the market used to work is that players would buy one big new game, spend all their time on that, then move onto the next one. But people just aren't buying new games anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you take the top ten service games every month...on PlayStation and Xbox, seven out of every ten people that turn on their console will play at least one of those games every month, and in terms of total time they're taking, those ten games alone every month take up 40% of total playtime on the consoles." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Piscatella also shares that at the time, Circana expected 30% of people that play video games would not buy a video game in 2025 (the actual numbers for the full year haven't been released just yet). A further 18% would purchase a new game every six months or less frequently. Only 12% buy a game once a month, and 4% buy new games more often than that.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"So when we're talking about the developers and publishers who are being hurt the most, are the games that are really targeting this 16% of total players that are purchasing very frequently, while the vast majority of players are buying a game or two a year, and they're playing Fornite, Minecraft, and Roblox."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is that it's harder than ever for brand new games to break through, which has been a major part of the recent wave of layoffs, studio closures, project cancelations, and just general industry devasation that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-developers-mass-layoffs-human-impact-sony-ea">we've been reporting on</a> primarily in the US industry for the last couple of years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Piscatella concluded that Kinda Funny presentation with a sentence he's said to me many times, and continues to say: "The biggest competitor to any new video game is Fortnite."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Circana is expected to release its full report on US video game sales in 2025 later this month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Don't "Fly Away" from this interview.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, IO Interactive revealed that musician and singer Lenny Kravitz would be making his video game debut in 007: First Light – not as the singer of a film-like Bond Theme, but as an actual character in the game. Cast as Bawma, a charismatic pirate king with a mysterious edge, Kravitz's video game debut promises action, intrigue, and a dash of rockstar theatrics. I had the opportunity to speak with him about his role in the game, his decades-long love for the Bond films, and to try to glean a little bit more about his character’s role in this twist on a traditional Bond story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally announced as “Project 007” in 2020, IO Interactive has started to loosen the valve on information about its upcoming game starring the international man of mystery. While we still haven’t had a chance to go hands-on with the project, it looks promising. Blending Hitman-style stealth-action with the globetrotting cinematic shine and sense of humor you’d expect from any silver screen adventure starring your pick of the actors who’ve held a license to kill, it feels appropriate that its villains would be larger than life, just like in the novels and films. That all starts with a bit of blockbuster stunt casting.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/06/knt-bawma-screenshot-3840x2160-1767730028977.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lenny Kravitz as Bawma in 007: First Light.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though he’s new to the series as an actor, Kravitz’s love for the James Bond movies as a fan goes back to his time lining up to see Roger Moore’s films in junior high and high school. “I used to line up on the first night it would be in the theater with a friend of mine,” the musician told me, making sure to pay lip service to his favorite leading men, Roger Moore and Sean Connery. “The theme songs were always amazing, too, always epic,” he told me, reminiscing on Carly Simon’s Nobody Does It Better from The Spy Who Loved Me before shouting out his favorites: Shirley Bassey’s iconic Goldfinger, Wings’ Live and Let Die, and Duran Duran’s A View To Kill.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Kravitz’s cool charisma and rockstar persona feel well-tuned for the role of a pirate king.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Kravitz’s cool charisma and rockstar persona feel well-tuned for the role of a pirate king. But he insists that he’s not just playing himself or sending up his favorite campy villains of bygone Bond films. Instead, he looked inward, drawing on his own experiences for inspiration. “I’ve met some folks that are… similar to his character. I grew up in the Bahamas as well as New York City and there were guys who had [Bawma’s] vibe and were doing similar things in the islands.” The musician told me the hardest part of playing Bawma was finding that voice and personality. “It’s really all in the voice,” he assured me. “It took a moment, but eventually we found the sweet spot.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But Kravitz isn’t just a prolific performer. He also brought some of his expertise as an icon in the fashion world to the character, even getting involved in giving notes to the art and design team, weighing in on Bawma’s costume as seen in his reveal trailer. From the cut of his jacket to the placement of tattoos and scars, the final design in the trailer was the result of deep collaboration between Kravitz and the IO Interactive team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During our conversation, Kravitz dropped a few hints that Bawma might not be an outright bad guy, though, painting him as more of a morally ambiguous antihero, rather than a straightforward villain. “He’s an interesting guy. We’re not quite sure how he’s going to turn.” IO Interactive CEO and 007 First Light Director Hakan Abrak told me, “We wanted more than just a one-sided villain, like we wanted to have some kind of charisma.” Abrak added that he’s not all-out evil, teasing, “He has more sides to him that could maybe turn out surprising in the story. You’ll need to wait to see that until the game comes out.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That depth played into IO’s casting for Bawma, Abrak told me. During early meetings, IOI realized they needed a performer who could captivate a crowd to fit the character they’d written. He told me, “The way Lenny moves, the way he draws sympathy and empathy kind of drags you in as a person” played a big role in pushing IO to choose the rockstar for this role.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since these interviews, IO Interactive has announced that 007 First Light has been delayed from March 27, 2026, to May 27, 2026.
