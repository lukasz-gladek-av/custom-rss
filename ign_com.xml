You play as Kana Luna, aka Mercury, and you can expect to mix guns, magic, story, and player choices within the Dark Syndicate in what developer Nesting Games hopes will be one of 2025's most memorable games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Third-person gunplay mixes with magic spells as you set out to catch a supernatural serial killer. You'll upgrade your offensive and defensive skills along the way, granting you agency in gameplay. But you'll also have it in the narrative, as well, where Nesting says, "Even romance has risks. Every choice has consequences. Choose whether to stay loyal to the Edicts of the Directorate or retain your humanity in the real world." Duality also appears to be a theme, as Nesting says you'll "navigate a treacherous path at night as a magical hitman and juggle your normal life during the day. When your two lives collide, beware who gets caught in the clash."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Directorate: Novitiate - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nesting Games expects to release The Directorate: Novitiate in Early Access on Steam this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.
