Although December is quickly coming to a close, the update adds more than enough winter-themed distractions to keep players preoccupied for weeks to come. Highlights include various Christmas decorations and maps, hidden presents to find, a new Gold Shop, and Leaderboard Season 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those hopping into Anime Defenders after the Christmas Update will first notice the snow, presents, and trees that now pollute the lobby. These are more than just festive trinkets, though, as the added clutter has been used to carefully hide presents that, once acquired, unlock some of those new maps. Completing additional Santa Claus quests can unlock even more goodies, with daily quests also gifting players with rewards should they continue to log in between now and December 26. There's also a limited Christmas Banner, which contains six new units to collect.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/anime-defenders-1734476101342.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Anime Defenders Christmas Update is available now.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to every new holiday item added as part of the Anime Defenders Christmas Update, players can take advantage of a new trading currency: Emerald.

But like I've said before, the year also had its lows where even established franchises like Dune, Like a Dragon, Mario and plenty of others had a hard time sticking the landing between their multiple releases this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And like the content we consume, we as humans are also subject to ups and downs throughout the year, and we know everyone has their good and bad days. But it's time to recognize the most outstanding members of our community -- the users that more often than not exemplify the best parts of our community. We enjoy celebrating them for all they do to create a positive atmosphere here at IGN. From users who comment daily to those who visit sparingly, we are grateful for your passion for and dedication to having spirited conversations with your fellow community members.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They say good things come in threes, so to celebrate our third year of fostering a positive and inclusive environment for all members we're once again paying tribute to our top users based on their accounts and how they interact with others in the community. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/04/08/commentsoftheweek-blogroll-01-1649456618377.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year we celebrated and rewarded 11 upstanding members of our community, with of a portion of them maintaining a perfect comment record. Those members were<strong> Midori85, 1track, wuzzgoodhommy, tenken8, ForceStream, CurryLova, Doctor_MG, NDWest14, McGarnicle, TAGibby4, and Real Frowns. </strong>To up the ante this<strong> </strong>year we will be celebrating 15 users! Check back next week when we unveil the best-performing members of the community that topped the comment charts.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The winners will all be receiving a gift of IGN Plus as a way of saying thank you, so keep an eye out for our update early next week, and for our winners an e-mail detailing how to redeem your gift. </p><h2 data-cy="title1">IGN Community Voted Awards</h2><p

noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Thank you to everyone who participated in our community-voted awards categories this year. In nine of the 13 categories, the winners garnered over 40% of the total votes, so while some of you may be prone to spirited debates, a large portion of you agreed on your 2024 favorites. We even have blowouts in a few categories: Silent Hill currently has over 80% of the votes for Best Horror Game, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has over 67% of the votes for the Best Xbox Game. The closest category you voted on was the Best Game of 2024, which was decided by less than 1500 votes, cementing Black Myth: Wukong as the IGN audience's favorite over Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, which are tied for second. And while Game of the Year was the most-voted category this year, the Best TV Show category was just behind it in total votes and, despite the resentment we often hear around recent Marvel projects, it was Agatha All Along that took the win with 27.5% of the votes, beating out popular shows like Shogun, Fallout, and The Penguin. Again, thank you to everyone who joined in on the fun; we look forward to seeing how 2025 turns out. </p><h2 data-cy="title1">Keepin' It Clean</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the year, we have also been monitoring those on the opposite end of the spectrum who do not foster a positive experience. We remove the most problematic users regularly to improve everyone's overall experience. But we also use this time before the end of the year as an opportunity to remove those who were given more time to see if their infractions throughout the year created a pattern or were potentially just someone having a bad day or week. So, in addition to recognizing the users who uplifted our community, we have also removed several users who have consistently violated our community guidelines. These banned accounts are those who have engaged in hate speech, harassment, or other toxic behaviors. We know these actions are not always popular, but they are necessary in our commitment to creating a safe and welcoming space for everyone at IGN. With that being said we will be updating the ToS in 2025, so be sure to check them out once those go live in early January. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we continue to build upon our community, we will continue to monitor and address any problematic behavior to ensure that our community remains a positive and inclusive place for everyone. We can create a respectful, supportive, and enjoyable community by working together. Keep an eye out in 2025 as we have even more plans for the community to ensure we are fostering a welcoming space for everyone and hopefully a few surprises.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We appreciate our readers who regularly make us their home for gaming, entertainment, and more. We are excited to continue building and improving together in the coming months and years. Once again, thank you to all of you who regularly do your best to create a positive experience on IGN. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
