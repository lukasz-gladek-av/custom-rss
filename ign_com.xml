            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo recorded more than 30 minutes of extra conversations featuring Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's chatty companion characters that don't currently appear in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The voice lines have now been datamined and uploaded to <a href="https://youtu.be/zXkXBIabO04" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/you-want-me-to-build-rocket-skates-fans-uncover-30-mins-of-cut-metroid-prime-4-dialogue/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a>) where fans can listen in to long stretches of cut <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4</a> banter, recorded for the Galactic Federation troops Samus encounters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, these conversations would have played out at Base Camp, between much-maligned mechanic Miles MacKenzie, and later NPCs such as the robot VUE-995, Private Armstrong, Sergeant Duke and Corporal Tokabi.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Listening in to the conversations, these are all non-essential chats that add to each character's backstory and personality. Most are designed to be humorous, such as the chats between hulking mech VUE-995 and Private Armstrong talking about working out, getting a tattoo-like custom paint scheme, and Armstrong's love of dogs. Armstrong even discusses her pet pooch back home, named Bowser.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking with Sergeant Duke, VUE-995 is told he needs greasing up, as the other troops are complaining that he's squeaking. As a group, the team also discusses eating jerky. (There are no voice lines featuring Samus, for obvious reasons.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It remains to be seen whether this dialogue is ever used for anything, or made available in-game via a future update. (Perhaps it's being saved for the launch of a New Game Plus mode?) Alternatively, the fact the dialogue has been cut could be a sign that Nintendo knew its cheery marines might come across as an odd fit in Metroid Prime — a series known for its themes of isolation, with a famously silent protagonist and little to no other dialogue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, Nintendo held back all mention of these characters' presence until a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-the-final-preview">pre-release preview just a month from the game's launch date</a>.

"It tries to mix the excellent Prime formula with a character-focused story and a large hub world to explore. It doesn't quite reach that ambitious goal, with an outdated open desert area that mostly feels like padding and a cast of characters that provide both a handful of memorable moments and too much chatter at times."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-30-first-impressions-of-the-switch-2-version</link>
            <guid>1384834</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">For the Animal Crossing fans looking for new dialogue or major overhauls to what exists in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, you may not want to hold your breath for the 3.0 Update or the Nintendo Switch 2 version. The announcement for anything new for the five-year-old game was already a delightful surprise (especially after Nintendo previously said they were done with major updates years ago), but there don't seem to be many secrets or surprises beyond what was shown in the reveal trailer. IGN was invited by Nintendo to get a hands-off look at what's coming to ACNH on January 15, 2026, and the roughly 25-minute demo confirmed certain ACNH fan factions' excitement and disappointment: namely, this one is for the decorators. That being said, as someone who does love decorating in Animal Crossing, this update is an exciting reason for me to play more regularly again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 version's three main features aren't all that interesting, though the speed and graphical updates are pleasing. In the demo, I saw and had it confirmed that the Switch 2 exclusive Megaphone tool is limited to calling residents who can actually hear. So, it won't impact anyone inside a building, which makes it less useful for tracking down a particular character. Then, the final major benefit to playing on Switch 2 is being able to play with up to 12 people total in multiplayer, though that hinges on <em>everyone</em> in the session playing on a Switch 2. I feel lucky I know even three people still playing, leaving this update as the least impactful.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The hotel is by far the biggest change out of everything. It was explained that, like other facilities in ACNH, the hotel is something you'll unlock. Since it's tied to the pier, it cannot be moved and getting it is not optional. I didn't see what's involved in building the hotel, but once it's there, it'll receive season-appropriate decor like other facilities. Inside is the welcoming site of Kapp'n's family. The main activity you'll do in the hotel is decorating rooms similar to the Happy Home Paradise DLC, with the key difference being that you have a list of room themes to choose from (such as Ranch Room, Skyscraper Room, and plenty more) and are free to do what you will with it… or skip using a theme entirely and freestyle the design. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you use a theme, you're provided a selection of items that match. Though unlike HHP, you're not required to use any specific items even if you do opt to use a theme. Then, when you're done, you'll receive a reward of the new hotel currency, tickets, once per day. You can keep decorating the eight guest rooms, but you won't receive any extra currency. Tickets can then be spent at the hotel gift shop that has hotel-related items along with new furniture, most of which I did not get to see. The other way to earn tickets is by crafting requested items for Kapp'n. The new bulk crafting feature wasn't shown in my demo either.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/15/switch2-acnh-ns2e-announce-trl-guest-room-decor-scrn-02-1765828312788.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Tourists who stay in the hotel can roam your island in the customizable outfits displayed in the hotel, which helps to clearly identify them. Unfortunately, there wasn't much interaction with tourists in my demo. The one conversation with a tourist didn't make it clear whether or not they can be invited to stay on the island, though it was mentioned in the demo that if the visitor is convinced, they could potentially become a resident. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The four new characters coming to ACNH with 3.0 (two from Splatoon, two from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom) weren't present in the demo, though the items that get added to ACNH after scanning one of their respective series amiibo were. It was clarified that to get one of the new Splatoon or Legends of Zelda characters and the associated special items, all you need to do is scan any one amiibo from their respective franchise, rather than any specific amiibo. The items looked great peppered around the item, and it seems most of the items are interactive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those looking for even more decorating, Slumber Islands await. We unfortunately again didn't see much of the special Slumber Island space beyond what was shown in the reveal trailer. This feature requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. With that, you'll get access to three island save spots and can create a small, medium, or large island, with the large size being close to being the size of the normal island. The Animal Crossing community has come up with some amazing island designs over the years, and the Slumber Islands feature is primed to encourage even more of that. Whatever you've collected will be available on the Slumber Islands, and anything you do or use in the dreams won't impact your main island. It was confirmed during the demo that there won't be any new additional custom design save slots, though, so players will need to get creative with what's already available if custom designs are a key part of their island design process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our demo didn't show Resetti's new suite of cleanup services, all the new items coming with the hotel, or how much it costs to upgrade storage. There wasn't a chance to ask the developers questions either, so it's still unclear whether we should expect any other ACNH updates beyond this. I'm eager to see the patch notes whenever Nintendo releases them to see if there are any secret small quality of life updates or item updates for holidays (will we get a 2026 balloon arch for the New Year's event?), but, as I mentioned earlier, I'm skeptical we'll see any major changes other than what's been announced. Even still, I'm enjoying having a reason to return to my island and get it cleaned up for future tourists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Miranda Sanchez is the executive editor of guides at IGN and a member of </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Unlocked</a><em>.

Well, Geoff Keighley tweeted it, so we're not surprised by how it turned out after that. I mean, I actually thought we were gonna make it, that it wasn't gonna leak until the show. But yeah, bureaucracy was against us because it was too fast [and too close to the show]. Normally, it takes more time for something like that to be filed, and here they filed really, really fast.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/unnamed-17-1765885306252.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Hellstone teased the announcement of Divinity ahead of The Game Awards.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: After the success of Baldur's Gate 3, it seemed like you and the developers had a lot of options for what was next – especially continuing with that franchise. Firstly, was the plan to always return to the Divinity series right after BG3 was finished?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>No, we were working on something else for Baldur's Gate originally, and I think we've talked about that publicly. Eventually, we were going to go back to the Divinity series, but before we did, we were going to take more time away from it, and then we changed our minds, honestly. Our hearts weren't into the thing that we were making before this, so it was an instant decision to say, 'Okay, we have to make Divinity now. So let's start doing it.' But when we did, it took us a little while to set everything up because we didn't have anything ready. So it was quite a flip, for sure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How far along in development is Divinity right now?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>We've been working on it for over two years in development. We're now in full production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: It can't be stated enough how massively successful Baldur's Gate 3 was for not just Larian Studios, but for how it renewed interest in the CRPG genre, the larger Dungeons and Dragons franchise, and also brought in new players for both of those. What were some key lessons you took away from that, and what do you plan to bring into the next Divinity?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>One of the biggest lessons was the success of cinematics – and how we present the story and choices. Obviously, we did a lot of things differently in BG3 than we did with Divinity: Original Sin 2, and that game was much better, I think. But the fact that, when people started seeing choices cinematically, what an impact that has on players, how they bond with the characters, and the attractions and choices in the game. So I think that was probably my biggest takeaway from everything, yeah, for sure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Does returning to the Divinity series feel different now following the success of BG3? Do you view this series differently now compared to how you felt about Divinity: Original Sin 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Yeah, in a way. We learned the value of having a solid universe behind you, for sure. One of the first things we started doing was saying, 'Okay, we're gonna put a lot of effort into making this universe feel tidy.' That's also why we are just calling it Divinity, right? There's never been a game that's just Divinity first, because there were all kinds of versions with different names. So this is actually going to be Divinity, which is going to have a proper universe backing it. We're building everything as you would expect, with lots of surprises, so that we can build on top of it. We learned that from BG, because we spent a lot of time delving through all kinds of DnD books, so that's probably one of the biggest takeaways from that development process.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Divinity Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Divinity is also entirely owned by Larian Studios. You all have intimate knowledge of the lore, and without working with other agencies.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Yeah, we also have the benefit of being able to do what we want with it, right? Other things do not bind us. I mean, D&amp;D, for all its glory, is a ruleset that is made for tabletop role-playing games. Here, we have the benefit of making something that's actually a video game first. So it's very different, but I think people who enjoyed Baldur's Gate 3 are gonna love what we're doing with this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: There must be a great freedom in being able to bend and even break the rules of your systems however you please.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Yes, and we want you to break the systems in our games. That's our gameplay formula; we want you to break things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: That was a part of the fun of Baldur's Gate 3 for many people; you could come up with some wacky solutions to combat and quests. Would you say you're looking to elevate that even with Divinity?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Yes [Laughs]. But I can't talk about the game's mechanics yet. I think you want to discover this aspect by seeing it. It's one thing to talk about it, but when you're gonna see it in action, you're gonna say, 'Ah!,' you're gonna be nodding. I think if you like BG3, this is gonna be great.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is the scope of this game bigger than Original Sin 2 and even Baldur's Gate 3?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Ah, smart question. I will say that it's bigger than BG3. I've actually never compared BG3 to Original Sin 2, so I don't know what the numbers are. I reckon BG3 is bigger for sure, yeah, but Original Sin 2 is pretty big as well. I can't compare Divinity to Original Sin 2 accurately, but I can say that it'll be bigger than BG3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: As you develop the Divinity universe further, do you feel more comfortable operating within this setting, and does it feel easier compared to BG3?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>I mean, it actually feels a bit harder because we have to create the entire universe. We really wanted to tidy up because the first Divinity games were made with little thought for universe-building, and it's only in Original Sin 2 that we started thinking more about it – but even then, not really 100% to what we did with Baldur's Gate 3. So now we're really thinking about it, and so that's a lot of work to make sure we get it right. Because it's the little things, right? I mean, what do people do when they go out to eat? What do they do when they go to sleep? What all of that has to be called out. So there's a lot of stuff to consider.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Shifting to a development question, Baldur's Gate 3 and Divinity: Original Sin 2 used the early access release model. Will Divinity be planned with a similar release model, including early access?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Most likely, but I don't want to commit to it right now, because we don't know how the games industry will change. We're not ready to do anything in early access yet, but I think it's worked well for us in the past. We had the player community and their feedback, and that has made all of our games that were in early access much better. So yeah, I think we would very much like to do that again. But that said, we don't want too many people playing in early access, because we do need to 'cook' and it's still a period of development. So that might be a little bit problematic, but we'll see. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Given that Baldur's Gate 3 and Original Sin 2 were still very much structured in traditional CRPG gameplay, do you feel the need to switch things up with mechanics to go for something different?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Well, we certainly want to innovate, yeah. But there are some core pillars that we don't need to change. It's going to be a single-player game, and it's also going to be a cooperative multiplayer game. Obviously, all within our formula, and there's still plenty of room for innovation. So you will see. There will be more agency for sure, more freedom for sure, more shenanigans that you can do for sure. So, in the combination of all these things, that's the thing that will surprise people the most.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: It feels like we're in this renaissance period for role-playing games in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3, especially the CRPG-style of video games. As a developer and an admirer of the genre, do you feel optimistic about where this genre of games is going, especially in how they tell stories?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Yeah, certainly for the genres of RPGs, I can't speak for other developers, but you see that there's way more interest and investment money available to put into RPGs. I mean, an RPG won the Game of the Year tonight at The Game Awards. We also have Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which was also nominated tonight, along with Hades 2, which has a lot of RPG elements, even though it's a roguelite. So, I think it's… normal, yeah? Because I think it's one of the best genres out there.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/65718f3be3efa-1765886424254.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Swen Vincke admits the pressure is on Larian to deliver.

I took an interest in it very early on because the art style instantly appealed to me. So yeah, I think it's a remarkable achievement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: When it comes to working on the next Divinity game after BG3, is there a sense of pressure on yourselves to deliver?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Yeah, the pressure is high. Pressure is high. Yes, for sure. We feel the pressure on our shoulders, yeah, especially because we set high ambitions for ourselves. But I mean the opposite of that would be that we say, "Oh, you know what, we'll just make a lesser game." That wouldn't be very motivating at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Well, it seems like you're feeling great about the current vision for Divinity and feeling good about what's to come.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Oh, no, we're in the middle of development – there's always anxiety, for sure [Laughs]. These are complicated things to make, so it's not like, "Oh, let's make the game." No, it's a mess [to make games], but we'll be fine eventually. The team is good, we have trust, and we know that they know what they're doing, that eventually we're going to get what comes out of it. But if you were to go and look now, it's as messy as a building that is under construction, right? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, we will figure it out. We will learn the language of the game and how to write in it to start making poetry. Eventually, it gets really good, but it takes time. It takes iteration, and every single time you take an extra step, you learn more things about your game, and then you improve it. And that's just a process that takes time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Kennedy, which look to feature an ominous-looking mark on his neck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The past week has been a rollercoaster for Leon fans, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/confirmed-leon-s-kennedy-is-in-resident-evil-requiem-playstation-store-leak-reveals">leaked artwork</a> confirming the character's long-rumored presence in Requiem, followed by his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-finally-confirms-leon-s-kennedy-is-in-resident-evil-requiem-the-game-awards-2025-ign">official unveiling</a> in a trailer at The Game Awards last Thursday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But now there's concern for Leon's future — as fans analyse screenshots from Capcom's latest trailer that seemingly show a dark, bloodied wound on the hero's neck, and following a comment from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> producer Akifumi Nakanishi who stated that Leon is hiding "a big secret."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has revisited last week's official Resident Evil Requiem trailer that aired during The Game Awards, and enhanced the screenshots you can see below. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/resident-evil-requiem-3rd-trailer-00-03-12-2-1765890925558.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Leon in Resident Evil Requiem's latest trailer.

Image credit: Capcom/IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Could this be a zombie bite, or potentially another infection? The question has prompted furious debate among fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ResidentEvilCapcom/comments/1pl3v90/leons_neck/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> and <a href="https://x.com/neko_sougo/status/1999397917627736427?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a>, while others have suggested this would be an unlikely plot point for Capcom to explore again, after Leon was injected with Las Plagas during Resident Evil 4. Other fans, however, have said this mark could be a sign of Leon's older Las Plagas infection slowly recurring — as a neat way to tie Leon's story in Requiem back to the franchise's most popular entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jokingly, some fans have suggested the mark is a nod to Capcom's non-canon Game Boy Color title Resident Evil: Gaiden, in which Leon is revealed to secretly be a monster when green blood oozes from a wound on his neck. Alternatively, one other fan claimed, it's a love bite from Ada. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The topic of whether Leon will die has long been debated by fans anticipating his appearance in Requiem, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade-resident-evil-requiem-will-return-to-franchises-original-overarching-narrative-featuring-raccoon-city-and-umbrella">Capcom has suggested will conclude story threads from the franchise so far</a>. Will the passing of Leon — for many, the series' most popular character — be used to mark the end of Resident Evil's current era of storytelling, as it marks its 30th anniversary?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil: Requiem - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speculation has only intensified after remarks from Requiem producer Akifumi Nakanishi, who was asked by <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/2512124p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Denfaminicogamer</a> about the word "Elpis," which appears in the game's latest trailer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Although I can't reveal any details yet, Leon has a big secret, and Elpis is involved in that as well," Nakinishi said, "and it has an important meaning. I hope that as you play, you will be able to unravel Elpis' secret.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In ancient Greek mythology, Elpis is a symbol left behind in Pandora's Box, from which various disasters are said to have flowed," he continued. "It is generally interpreted as 'hope,' but in fact, some people also see it as 'disaster.' This is an important element in the story of Requiem."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Leon's fate ultimately be one of hope or disaster?
