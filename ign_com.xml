The Burglar is back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Burglar, a familiar sight for those of us who've spent time with any of the older Sims games, is sneaking back into your life as part of the latest update for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-sims-4"><u>The Sims 4</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rolling out across PC and console, the update (re)introduces Robin Banks, which means it's time to hide your valuables well out of sight. She only strikes at night, usually only sneaking into homes when everyone's asleep, but she has been known to attempt a daring heist even when Sims are awake... so be alert.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To combat the thief, Sims can make use of the handy burglar alarm. If Banks trips it, the police are guaranteed to turn up in time to arrest her and recover your goods. But even homes without an alarm can call the police, you just have to be quick about it. Or there's vigilante justice, of course. It's your call.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/ts4-burglar-dev-diary-article-asset-1-1740568751546.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Burglar is finally in The Sims 4, over 10 years after it came out.

"Sending a special shout out to our full team for making this a reality. Robin Banks isn’t just ready to rob your Sims’ houses — she’s here to steal your hearts too! What better way to celebrate The Sims 25th Birthday than with this nostalgic yet fresh addition? We hope you’re as excited as we are to see what kind of chaos Robin Banks will bring to your households."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sims 4 may be 10 years old — and the series itself 25 years old — but last year, it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-earnings-the-sims-4-manages-to-adds-15-million-new-players-in-2024-despite-being-more-than-10-years-old"><u>attracted over 15 million new players</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In EA's Q2 earning report, published towards the end of last year, we learned that The Sims 4, then a premium game, took four years to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/02/04/how-sims-navigated-20-years-change-become-one-most-successful-franchises-ever/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reach 20 million unique players</u></a>.

"I understand and sympathize that it may not suit your personal taste, but if you prefer the old design, past works already exist. I am not taking those away from you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Also, you refer to yourself as 'Anna fans,' as if you represent all Anna fans, but you should express your opinion as an individual.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You threaten to quit if she isn’t brought back. You complain the moment she is brought back. You demand that she be reverted after she has been completely redesigned from scratch, including her model and framework," he added. "And if she actually were reverted, you’d just say, 'That’s recycling!'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Either way, your method of expressing your opinion and the content of your argument are entirely unconstructive, utterly pointless, and, above all, disrespectful to the other Anna fans who are genuinely looking forward to her."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When another commenter <a href="https://x.com/HakethKOTB/status/1894612531085537601" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out</a> that Tekken "hasn’t rereleased one of [its] older games into modern systems with functional netcode" and summarized Harada's response as "a joke," the director said: "Thank you for POINTLESS reply. You yourself are the joke. MUTED."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned, reaction to Anna's new design is largely positive, although there are some complaints, mostly around her outfit. "Before she was announced I was hoping for an edgier, angry, violent Anna out for revenge for her fiance's death and so I'm quit happy with this design!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/comments/1ixx07i/comment/mepnya0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor AngryBreadRevolution</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The hair is growing on me. It really suits the outfit and personality well. It wont look good on all her outfits naturally, but her original bob will still be available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Coat was ruined for me when it was pointed out the resemblance to Christmas. The leotard, tights, boots and gloves all look fantastic though so looking forward to being able to take off the coat."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Love everything but the white feathers," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/comments/1ixr6yq/comment/meogj8k/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said troonpins</a>. "It’s giving Santa Clause."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Aside from looking like Santa Claus, she looks a lot younger than she did in Tekken 7 and before," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/comments/1ixr6yq/comment/meok4px/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added Cheap_Ad4756</a>. "She looks like less of a 'woman' now and more like a girl. I don't get the dominatrix vibe from her at all anymore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Horrible," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Tekken/comments/1ixr6yq/comment/meopduv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared spiralqq</a>. "It’s another overdesigned T8 look, feels like almost every costume in this game lacks a real focal point and everyone is just decked out in 100 bulky accessories from head to toe. I’d like it a lot more without the coat, or at the very least if the whole outfit didn’t look like Santa cosplay. You can’t have a bright red coat with white fur trims and a black belt and read as anything other than Santa."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tekken 8 has sold 3 million copies a year from release, achieving the sales milestone at a faster pace than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tekken-7"><u>Tekken 7</u></a>, which took 10 years to sell 12 million copies worldwide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Tekken 8 is an amazing new entry in the long-running series," we wrote in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-review"><u>IGN's Tekken 8 review</u></a>, awarding it 9/10. "Interesting tweaks to its classic fighting systems, a full suite of fun offline modes, great new characters, incredible training tools, and a vastly improved online experience all add up to a fighting game I will be playing for many years to come. By honoring its legacy, but continuing to move forward, Tekken 8 manages to stand out as something special."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.
