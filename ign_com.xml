Like how this year's Fantastic Four movie was a '50's version of the future? Enter ROUTINE, an upcoming first-person sci-fi horror game set on a lunar base. Like all good horror games, silence and loneliness are your worst enemies, and that's true in ROUTINE – except for the part where you discover a foe who thinks the primary threat is, in fact, you. Piece together the events that took place prior to your arrival, and try to survive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ROUTINE is our IGN First "cover story" game for November, ahead of its December 4 release for PC (Steam and Xbox on PC) and Xbox (Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Xbox Cloud) – including Xbox Game Pass on day one. This exclusive video (watch it above) introduces you to the Megazone Arcade area of the lunar base, including playable minigames. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Routine - 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">ROUTINE has quite the development story, having originally been announced over a decade ago. It was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/routine-horror-sci-fi-reveal-xbox-px-game-pass">re-revealed</a> in 2022, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/routine-we-finally-played-after-13-years-of-waiting-gamescom-2025">we finally played it</a> for the first time earlier this year.

Long-term The Simpsons voice actor Hank Azaria subsequently announced he would no longer portray the role — and since then, the character has only appeared without dialogue.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/epic-games-celebrates-fortnite-player-spike-as-the-simpsons-season-launches">Epic Games celebrated a spike in player numbers as Fortnite's The Simpsons season launched</a> to a positive response.
