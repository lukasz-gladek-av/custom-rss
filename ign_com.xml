            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plus, massive discounts on the PlayStation Store. </h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re coming up on Labor Day weekend, which closes out the summer and tends to be a popular occasion to drop prices. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/labor-day-sales-2025">Labor Day sales</a> have already gone live at most major retailers, with deals worth checking out on everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/target-lego-deals-labor-day-sale-2025">LEGO sets</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-gaming-pc-labor-day-sale-2025">gaming PCs</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the first thing I’m looking for in any of these sales is discounts on physical games. Surprisingly enough, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-labor-day-sale-2025">Amazon's Labor Day sale</a> has listed first-time discounts on some of the latest and greatest PS5 games, while the PlayStation Store has launched its own sale on digital editions. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon Drops Prices on the Latest PS5 Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The physical games I’ve listed above are all at or close to their lowest-ever prices. The discounts aren’t mind-blowing, I know, but they are the first price drops we’ve seen on recent releases like Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 and College Football 26, both of which just came out in July. The Tony Hawk remake has been especially popular here at IGN, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review">Luke Reilly’s review</a> saying it "proves yet again the series’ over-the-top skateboarding formula is totally timeless." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another personal recommendation is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">Split Fiction</a>, the latest two-person adventure from It Takes Two developer Hazelight Studios. This discount is made all the better by the fact that the co-op game only requires one person to buy it, while the other can download the game through Friend’s Pass. You could go 50/50 with a friend and grab the GOTY contender for $20 each. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Split Fiction - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">SEGA is generally going hard on the discounts right now, with an ongoing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/SEGAPublisherSale2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publisher sale on Steam</a> and price cuts on those games at pretty much every retailer. Last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> is the highlight I've included here, but you can also find discounts on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">Persona games</a> as well as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-games-in-order">Yakuza series</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Playstation’s Ready, Set, Play! Sale: Up to 75% Off Digital Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While not branded as having anything to do with Labor Day, the Playstation Store has launched its Ready, Set, Play! sale at the same time as the holiday weekend. The promotion mainly applies to digital games and features separate discounts from what you’ll find on physical games at retailers like Amazon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You won’t find as many discounts on new releases (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-2025">PlayStation Plus</a> is the way to go for those), but the deals you will find are pretty massive. I’d take it as a good opportunity to do some homework before the big sequels we have coming up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A bundle of the two most recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-games-in-order">Resident Evil games</a> (outside of remakes) has dropped to just $19.99, giving you a solid gateway to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, while The Witcher 3 drops below $8 as we get ready for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv">The Witcher 4</a>. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">What About PS5 Console Deals? </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, I haven’t seen any discounts on PS5 consoles, which isn’t too surprising in light of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-5-price-rises-for-us">recent price hikes</a>. If you're desperate for the console, I highly recommend checking out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/certified-refurbished-ps5-deals-at-playstation">PlayStation's Certified Refurbished options</a>. Otherwise, here's to hoping we miraculously see some deals around Black Friday. <br>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">In the deep of the night.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring: Nightreign's previously-rumored ultra-hard difficulty mode is real and official, according to Bandai Namco, and it's coming to the game on September 11.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-high-difficulty-expedition-mode-deep-of-night-has-appeared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As announced in an official post</a>, the new mode is called "Deep of Night" and is essentially a challenge mode of the base game. While previously, Nightreign's ongoing challenging endgame content has been limited to more difficult bosses, Deep of Night will impact an entire run, from start to finish.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For one, enemies will just be stronger than normal across the board. You also won't get a heads up about which Nightlord you'll be fighting, nor will you know if you're getting a Shifting Earth event in advance, so you won't be able to prep a build for any specific type of run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, to counterbalance this, players will be able to collect new types of weapons and relics with even more powerful effects...though they may also have some new drawbacks attached as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you play and win Deep of Night you will descend to deeper depth levels, going at least as far as Depth 5. Each new Depth gets even more challenging, though losses will push you back up to easier Depths.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-dataminers-say-theyve-uncovered-an-entirely-new-ultra-hard-game-mode">This mode was previously datamined</a>, with dataminers getting all the announced details correct. Not announced but suggested by the datamine is that Deep of Night will feature skill-based matchmaking, and that some enemies will get special additional effects, such as being "magmafied," or covered in magma. The datamine also suggests that players can unlock access to three additional relic slots for Deep of Night only, giving them up to a total of six.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign a 7/10</a>, saying "when Elden Ring Nightreign is played exactly as it was designed to be played, it’s one of the finest examples of a three-player co-op game around – but that's harder to do than it should be, and playing solo is poorly balanced." The game recently got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-finally-gets-duos-mode-with-patch-102-game-balance-adjusts-to-the-current-number-of-players">a much-requested duos mode</a>, and currently has two Everdark Sovereign bosses available for players wanting a challenge before Deep of Night: Libra, and Caligo.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14s-yoshi-p-weighs-in-on-mods-after-popular-custom-character-sharing-mod-shuts-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-14s-yoshi-p-weighs-in-on-mods-after-popular-custom-character-sharing-mod-shuts-down.1283439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 14's community is once again in a tizzy about the use of mods in game, to the point where the game's producer and director, Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P), <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/9e5517bca992ff35133f519db15eb456d2183251" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has weighed in</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, some background. While modding is an extremely common practice across many games, including other MMORPGs like World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy 14 has always had a slightly more hostile relationship with them. That's not to say players don't use mods in FF14 - they absolutely do. But officially, they're not allowed. Even so, Square Enix has largely operated for a long time on a policy of letting mods slide...as long as players aren't too loud or obvious about it. So players might use mods to customize their UIs, or change the way their character looks just on their own screen. As long as they aren't interfering with other people's games or, say, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14s-latest-raid-sparks-controversy-as-world-first-winners-accused-of-cheating">being very public about their mod use</a>, the publisher has mostly turned a blind eye.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But that strategy hasn't always worked out for Square Enix, especially due to the lack of real clarity for players as to what Square Enix will be permissive about, versus what it will immediately ban. And recently, mods have been in the crosshairs of the developer once again. Earlier this year, Yoshi-P himself <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-director-yoshi-p-threatens-legal-action-against-stalking-mod">threatened legal action</a> after a mod went around that could track other people's player data - a mod that's pretty obviously not permitted by any standards. But more recently, a different, less obviously problematic mod has entered the discourse: Mare Synchronos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mare Synchronos is a mod that's become popular with Final Fantasy 14 players over the years, especially for role-playing communities. Essentially, it lets those who use it "synchronize" their character appearances with those of other players. Here's an example. If I'm playing FF14 and don't have a lot of cool gear to dress my character up in, and don't want to run the content needed to acquire it for whatever reason, I can use a mod that will let my character appear exactly how I want them to - but only on my screen. However, with Mare Synchronos, everyone else using Mare Synchronos can <em>also</em> see that modded appearance. Players who do not use the mod will see my character in whatever bland gear I'm actually wearing. And critically, Mare doesn't actually let you change your character's appearance - other mods are needed for that. Mare just lets you see other mods, and be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, a week ago, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1mwhuzu/final_fantasy_xiv_mod_mare_synchronos_is_shutting/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mare Synchronos announced it was shutting down</a>. The cited reason was that it had received a "legal inquiry" surrounding the project, and after reviewing options, the creator decided to wind it down. It officially went dark last Friday. While some fans were unphased by the shutdown, or even claimed they'd expected it eventually, many others were deeply upset. Though Mare's developer hadn't specified who the legal inquiry was from, many speculating it was likely Square Enix, and even took to the FF14 official forums to complain about the third-party mod shutting down. It's even getting review bombed on Steam right now, currently sitting at "Mixed" recent reviews versus "Very Positive" total reviews.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is what has prompted Yoshi-P to speak up. In a <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/9e5517bca992ff35133f519db15eb456d2183251" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lengthy post on the official Final Fantasy 14 website</a>, the producer reiterated his past-stated stance on mods: he tolerates them. That stance, he says, hasn't changed. Mods made entirely for one's own personal use that only impact the individual using them, Yoshi-P explains, are fine with him. "I'd like to stress the importance that players follow two rules: that their style of gameplay does not infringe upon others, and that they do not negatively impact the core game, its services, or intended game design, as mentioned above."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshi-P goes on to detail exactly what he means by "negative impacting the intended game design" and "infringing upon others." He offers an example of a player, Player A, who loves to raid and acquires a new title and weapon by successfully finishing an Ultimate raid. Player B does not have time to raid, and uses a mod that allows them to see their character with the same title and weapon as Player A. As long as that only displays on Player B's screen, that's not a problem for Yoshi-P.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, where Yoshi-P takes issue is when this begins to impact others. If Player B's changes are visible to Player A somehow, "it considerably negates the cooperation, time, and effort invested, not to mention the pride they might have felt in their achievement."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He goes on to illustrate another example that is unacceptable: a mod that allows players to freely equip optional items purchased from the FF14 Online Store and display them to others:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Some may say that Square Enix is to blame for trying to make money by demanding that players spend extra on optional items," he writes. "We operate our servers and data centers twenty-four hours a day, three-hundred-sixty-five days a year with the hope that our players can enjoy a reliable gaming experience. Currently, global inflation is taking its toll at a rapid pace, driving up server electricity costs, the cost of land, and even the price of servers themselves. We do not want to increase subscription fees for players, if at all possible─but keeping our game running requires sufficient income. If we start creating a deficit, FFXIV may no longer be able to operate. This is an example of damage dealt to the services we provide."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a third example, Yoshi-P mentions the possibility of a mod that displays a character completely naked. Even if this is only displayed on the player's screen, he explains how it could potentially still be harmful. For instance, if a player posts a screenshot of their naked character on social media, FF14 may face legal consequences.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I ask that all players in turn respect our game by enjoying their fun within the confines of some basic rules.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"Laws that regulate the content of video games grow stricter by the year," he says. "These laws are there to protect minors and for a variety of other reasons, but the fact remains that they are tangibly becoming stricter. We have a duty to provide our services in adherence to the laws of all countries where FFXIV is available, and if we are unable to do so, the distribution of our game can be prohibited. This is another example of damage dealt to our services."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshi-P ends his post by saying he intends to listen to player feedback and try to increase the freedom of players to equip different types of gear. "While paying respect to the long-standing tradition of modding PC games, I ask that all players in turn respect our game by enjoying their fun within the confines of some basic rules," he concludes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this post contains some much-needed clarification, it ultimately does leave Final Fantasy 14 in the same odd limbo state it's always been in: no mods allowed, except it's fine if no one ever knows you're using them. While that will likely be sufficient clarification for many players, it's still a potentially frustrating place for players who have built their gameplay styles around the modding community and what it has to offer. At least over on console, no one has anything to worry about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> will add a fresh batch of superpowered creatures to the franchise's Mega Pokédex — and here's every one revealed so far. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the game is not expected to add any all-new Pokémon species, Legends: Z-A's setting within the region of Kalos, the home of the Mega Evolution ability, has made it a fitting title in which to introduce a number of never-before-seen designs, and give players something fresh to collect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the run up to Pokémon Legends: Z-A's launch for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on October 16, 2025, The Pokémon Company has begun drip-feeding fans with new Mega Pokémon reveals — and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-mega-pokmon-gets-surprise-anime-appearance-months-before-debut-in-pokmon-legends-z-a">one species has even already made its Pokémon anime debut</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Below, we'll recap every Mega Pokémon announced so far, and discuss a widely-shared leak of all the Mega Pokémon species fans now expect.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Mega Dragonite</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/28/pokmon-presents-7-22-2025-00-19-47-1753190469031-1756396801414.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mega Dragonite.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first new Mega Pokémon species to be revealed in over a decade was Mega Dragonite, the beloved Dragon/Flying-type pseudo-legendary from the franchise's original Kanto Pokédex. Mega Dragonite gains a large set of wings that sprout from its head, and a large jewel on its tail thats reminiscent of its earlier evolution Dragonair. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For Mega Dragonite, ending a Pokémon match quickly is an act of kindness toward its opponent," reads the Pokémon Company's official blurb. "Its kindhearted nature gets amplified when it Mega Evolves, and it launches powerful attacks at its opponent with a smile. At the same time, if it senses someone in trouble, it has the kindness to instantly rush to their aid — even if it's in the middle of an intense battle."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mega Victreebell</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Second to be announced for Pokémon Legends: Arceus was another new Mega species hailing from the series' original 151 creatures: Victreebell. This Grass/Poison-type's Mega evolution features a more bulbous base, due to the volume of acid inside it, filling its mouth. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Its body has swollen as a result of Mega Evolution," reads its official blurb. "Even the leaves on top of its head have grown bigger. It flaps the leaves on its sides and moves its large body by bouncing around. It opens its large mouth to let loose a Sludge Bomb. It looks more like a Victreebel when it has deflated. It has so much acid that even closing its mouth tight isn't enough to hold it in, so it contains the acid by wrapping its own vines around its throat."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mega Hawlucha</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Luchador-inspired Hawlucha also gets a Mega Evolution, which will hopefully ensure it ultimately gets a wider release in Pokémon Go, where it currently sits as a Mexican regional exclusive. This Fighting/Flying-type is something of a fan-favorite, and once again its Mega's design focuses on its appearance as a masked wrestler.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It uses its muscles, bulked up by Mega Evolution, to take hit after hit from opponents' moves and flex its own strength," reads its official blurb. "After luring its opponent into attacking, it retaliates to make them flinch before diving at them using its signature move, Flying Press, to aim for victory. Before Mega Evolving, Hawlucha would sometimes let its guard down as it became caught up in parading its flashy moves, but with newfound confidence in its own defensive capabilities, it can now show off again and again to both its opponent and its Trainer. It lifts both hands and spreads its wings, constantly putting its beauty and tough pectoral muscles on full display."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">And more to come...</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to these new Mega Pokémon species, a previous trailer confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-first-trailer-reveals-rooftop-running-gameplay-and-late-2025-release-window?_cache=pass">the return of other, already-existing Mega Evoutions</a>, such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Absol, and Mega Charizard X — though it's unknown as of yet whether every past Mega Evolution will be present in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, Pokémon Legends: Z-A's central focus on Mega Pokémon is clear. The game's plot revolves around the seemingly-spontaneous Mega Evolution of local wild Pokémon, here dubbed as Rogue Mega Pokémon. Players will need to utilise their own Mega Pokémon to take them down, and you can also bring in help from another of your Team MZ allies to battle alongside you. But exactly what's going on here — and how the game will incorporate Zygarde into proceedings — are all questions for another day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, each of the announced new Mega Pokémon have corroborated a widely-shared leak listing 27 species set to receive new Mega Evolutions within Pokémon Legends: Z-A. These include, by region:</p><section><p><strong>Kanto:</strong> Mega Clefable, Mega Starmie, Mega Victreebell <em>(Confirmed)</em>, and Mega Dragonite <em>(Confirmed)</em> <strong>Johto:</strong> Mega Meganium, Mega Feraligatr, Mega Skarmory <strong>Sinnoh:</strong> Mega Froslass <strong>Unova:</strong> Mega Emboar, Mega Excadrill, Mega Scolipede, Mega Eelektross, Mega Scrafty, and Mega Chandelure <strong>Kalos:</strong> Mega Greninja, Mega Delphox, Mega Chesnaught, Mega Malamar, Mega Pyroar, Mega Dragalge, Mega Barbaracle, Mega Hawlucha <em>(Confirmed)</em>, Mega Zygarde, Mega Eternal Flower Floette <strong>Alola:</strong> Mega Drampa <strong>Galar:</strong> Mega Falinks </p></section><p data-cy="paragraph">With apologies to Flygon fans, these species are all of the ones that fans expect to encounter in Pokémon Legends: Z-A when it arrives. That said, it's worth reiterating that datamined information is not final, and it's likely that at least some of the game's Mega Pokémon may well be held back for the final game itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
