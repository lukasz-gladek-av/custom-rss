            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft's housing feature launched this week for everyone who purchased the upcoming Midnight expansion early. Though the feature is still in its early stages, players (including yours truly) are already losing hours upon hours creating elaborate homes with the decor available. But Horde players in particular are really struggling to contend with one major issue: their house exteriors are ugly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, that's a little mean. If you play an orc, or are into the orc aesthetics of spikes, flames, haphazard metal plates, and slapdash wooden boards nailed on, the Horde exteriors are fine. The issue is that a lot of the Horde - namely, everyone who doesn't play an orc - generally prefers a less...grungey aesthetic. Alliance players also only get one exterior housing option, but their homes are fairly standard, inoffensive cottages that most people will find tolerable at worst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately for anyone unhappy with what's on offer, until Midnight fully launches, this is it. You can customize your exterior in various ways by changing up roof colors and chimney styles, but it's all in your faction's default aesthetic. Blizzard has <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/blizzard-is-launching-their-own-dps-meters-and-improving-nameplates-in-midnight-378291" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promised that Night Elf and Blood Elf exteriors will arrive on Midnight's release</a>, with more options planned for later on. But for now you're stuck with either a cottage or a spike shack one way or another. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some players, like myself, are just trying to make the best of it with outdoor decorations. Here's my modest hut. You'd never know that inside is a cozy Shaman retreat, complete with a small magical library, a snug kitchen, and a stone altar dedicated in honor of the elements.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/wowscrnshot-120425-150753-1764885571991.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Home sweet orc shack.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But a lot of players are getting far, far more creative in their attempts to subvert the shabby exterior design. You see, Blizzard's decoration tools are very, very precise if you want them to be, and can ignore collision if you want them to. Which has led to Horde players trying to mask the orc-ness of their huts by covering them with...well, all sorts of other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, this person turned their house into a nice cave:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This person took a crack at a more Blood Elf-looking style:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This person made something simple yet effective:</p><div><blockquote data-embed-height="660" data-embed-theme="light">Posts from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1pdmsmr/i_reject_the_horde_mudhuts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wow</a><br> community on Reddit</blockquote></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this one is pretty cool:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, in doing this, one issue players are running up against is that there <em>is </em>a limit to how much decor you can put outside, and many of the objects people are using to cover up the orc turrets use up a significant portion of that limit. As a result, if you want to cover your house in rocks, you can't do much else with your yard. It seems like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1pe6ddu/blizz_please_increase_the_outdooor_decor_cap_ive/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everyone is begging Blizzard</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1pe0qfn/exterior_decor_limit_takes_away_a_lot_of_fun_out/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raise the exterior decor cap</a>, an issue they <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-asked-world-of-warcrafts-housing-team-about-couples-housing-more-neighborhoods-hidden-secrets-decorating-contests-and-more">told us they're well aware of and working on</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Realistically, this is not a massive issue at the moment: we knew going in that this was effectively an early access feature and some functionality would be limited. More than anything, it's funny to see the lengths players will go to in order to get creative with the tools they have available to them. Just imagine what they'll be capable of once they don't have to waste all their outdoor decor space on big wooden platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft: Midnight <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-expansion-release-date-confirmed">launches on March 2, 2026</a>. If you want to get your hands on housing before then, you've got to pre-order the expansion - any version of it will do. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-asked-world-of-warcrafts-housing-team-about-couples-housing-more-neighborhoods-hidden-secrets-decorating-contests-and-more">recently spoke with</a> Jesse Kurlancheek, housing lead and principal game designer, and Joanna Giannullis, senior UX designer, about the housing feature, including how its gone in the beta so far, and what to expect in Midnight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4</a> has confirmed the addition of something no video game has ever had before: a playable Primarch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Warhammer 40,000 lore, the Primarchs are genetically engineered, demigod-like warriors created by the Emperor of Mankind to lead the Space Marine Legions. They are immensely superior to other humans, possessing superhuman strength, speed, and intelligence, and each is designed to embody a specific trait or aspect of war, such as a master strategist or a stealth expert.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Primarchs have appeared in Warhammer 40,000 video games before (Roboute Guilliman, primarch of the Ultramarines, and Mortarion, Daemon Primarch of the Death Guard Chaos Space Marines, have popped up), none has ever been playable in all the years Warhammer 40,000 video games have been around — until now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dawn of War 4 developer King Art Games has confirmed Dark Angels Primarch Lion El'Jonson is playable at one point towards the end of the story campaign, co-written by Black Library author John French (Dropsite Massacre, Cypher: Lord of the Fallen). This also confirms the Dark Angels as a second playable chapter of Space Marines in the game alongside Dawn of War veterans the Blood Ravens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new story trailer shows the Dark Angels turn up to help the Blood Ravens in the fight against the Orks and Nercons on the war-torn world of Kronus. We get a glimpse of The Lion, with his helmet on, at the end of the trailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>The trailer opens with a look at how the Blood Ravens under Captain Cyrus and Chief Librarian Jonah Orion have arrived in orbit over Kronus at the start of the game. After an intense orbital fight with the Warboss Gorgutz and his Orks, both factions find themselves planetside where Guzcutta — the second Ork Commander — is already waiting.</blockquote><blockquote>Elsewhere on Kronus, Technoarcheologist Potentia Delta-9 surveys the planet for its lost knowledge as the Chronomancer Thothmek begins the Necron’s invasion, awakening Kronus’ dormant tombs in their own search for secrets.</blockquote><blockquote>The Imperium’s forces are beset on all sides, their last stand losing strength and the lines on the verge of collapse… until, at the crucial moment, it becomes clear they are not alone: the Dark Angels arrive.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 Dark Angels Trailer Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dark Angels are one of two factions of Space Marines in Dawn of War 4 and are a fully playable faction in all game modes. Here are the key points:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">● During the Space Marines campaign, players will undertake missions in command of both the Blood Ravens and the Dark Angels, and they can pick which missions they want to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">● The Dark Angels have their own, playable Commanders for the Space Marines campaign: Company Master Astoran and Chaplain Ezrael.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">● The Dark Angels have their own unique identity and history. As Space Marines, they share core strategies, tactics, wargear, and weaponry, while still maintaining the distinctive flavor and abilities of their Chapter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">● While the Blood Ravens are often engaged in smaller conflicts that require tactical finesse and sometimes involve stealth, the Dark Angels deploy their full might to the biggest battlefields. Precision strikes vs. all-out war.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">● As the story saga reaches its breaking point, Lion El’Jonson himself descends onto the battlefield, giving players, for the first time ever, the chance to wield the legendary might of a Space Marine Primarch in a climactic, unforgettable finale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of today’s announcement, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-didnt-really-care-about-balance-how-the-developers-of-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4-made-primarch-lion-eljonson-playable-in-game">IGN interviewed Dawn of War 4 director Jan Theysen to find out everything you need to know about Lion El'Jonson’s arrival</a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/hello-sunshine-is-survival-worth-sweating-for</link>
            <guid>1373809</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bask in the sun… and risk getting the meanest sunburn of your life. Hello Sunshine is an impressive step up from the usual post-apocalypse survival RPG formula, playing with some clever ideas around scorching sunlight, blissful shade, and the cycle of day and night.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I previewed a hands-off, pre-alpha slice of Hello Sunshine’s story-driven, single-player campaign with the developers at Red Thread Games, many of whom are veteran developers in the narrative gaming world (think Dreamfall, The Longest Journey, and The Secret World). </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hello Sunshine is looking extremely polished for something built by just seven people, and puts a cool twist on what “suspense” means in the genre. From the extreme, sizzling heat of day to uncovering lore during frigid nights – here is why I believe Hello Sunshine’s future is looking bright.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Coming in hot</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The team didn’t mention any sort of inspiration from the Fallout series, but right from the start screen there’s no denying the visual parallels – a skeleton in a folding camping chair, still clutching a drink as if the world ended mid-sip. Pressing the start button, the player character stumbles past, immediately launching you into this weird wasteland world. It wasn’t clear to me whether she was a preset character or customizable, but (in this preview, at least) she appeared to be the silent type.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The team didn’t mention any sort of inspiration from the Fallout series, but right from the start screen there’s no denying the visual parallels.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In this cruel and scorching desert, it’s clear that she is already suffering from the early symptoms of heatstroke, and she’s also very sad about finding a water bottle that turns out to be empty. This scene is the introduction to Hello Sunshine’s heat and thirst mechanics – a delicate balancing act of avoiding collapse from dehydration or slow-cooking in the harsh sunlight. Robots aside, the sun is essentially your biggest enemy (but with ray tracing).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ruined buildings yield water and other supplies that help you maintain a survivable body temperature, but shadows also play a huge role. If you’re roasting, resting in shade can keep your temperature down. And almost immediately, you’ll meet the most interesting shadow dynamic of all – Hello Sunshine’s other “main character,” who is a skyscraper-sized robot that seems to have a clearer idea of where it’s going than you do.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Chasing shadows</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This metallic gentle giant is, like you, wandering through these badlands. It kind of ignores you in the beginning, but you’ll be grateful for the enormous shadow it casts as it moves, shielding you from UV-based harm as you follow it along sand dunes and amongst rusted shipping containers. And no, it won’t wait patiently for you if you saunter off; you’ll need to keep up with its pace if you don’t want to end up dying humiliatingly of sunburn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is survival through solar instinct and (coining an ahem hot new term here) shade management, not health bars alone – creating an urgency that adds an unconventional form of suspense to your strange journey.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hello Sunshine Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The landscape, of course, hides precious resources – but you’ll need to strategize and carefully time your brief detours from the robot’s shadow. Spend too much time dilly-dallying and the robot may move too far ahead, meaning you won’t make it back before your heat meter runs out. The sun’s path, from afternoon to sunset, was particularly brilliant – with shadows lengthening or shrinking as the day progresses, you’ll need to adapt your decisions about how far you wander.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can expect that you’ll find more awesome loot the farther you stray, of course. No word yet on whether loot will be randomized each playthrough, but I’m hoping that will be the case. Whatever ingredients you’re able to grab could limit what you’re able to craft – and add further challenge, based on what gear you’re able to make and how that may limit your desired playstyle.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bringin’ on the heat</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not all sunbeams, however; Hello Sunshine does include combat, which you can shape according to your desired playstyle. Being noisy and aggressively guns-out (or, more accurately, bows-out), for instance, will probably attract even more enemies – and more scavengeable loot from their remains.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/hello-sunshine-robot-sunhi-2-1764881256232.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Or you can go for more defensive options, potentially even avoiding head-on conflict. I didn’t really get a sense of what a stealthier playthrough might look like, but I’m hoping the confrontational-to-avoidant spectrum is wide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your enemies, by the way, are more robots – definitely angrier than your giant friend – and they curiously seem to have taken on forms of the fleshy species that I assume were otherwise wiped out during the apocalypse. A little metal jackal will snap at your heels, for example, or a hulking robot crab may try to skewer you with its giant claw.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your character’s bow is one of the primary weapons. At first, it doesn’t look like much – kind of pitiful against giant armored bots, really – but you’ll be able to upgrade it throughout the game and craft better ammo for it, such as explosive arrows.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/hello-sunshine-footsteps-1764881256232.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Little events occur here and there to keep your journey interesting – like a distant airdrop of unspecified items, or a sandstorm that gives you brief respite from the sun but also reduces visibility, making it easier for you to lose your robot friend. Many of these events are procedural, hopefully unlocking varied experiences with subsequent playthroughs.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Befriending the sleeping giant</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Conveniently, your enormous robot companion has a circadian rhythm: once the sun sets, it will take a break to recharge. In the preview, this happened at the remains of a Sunshine service station – owned by the ominous corporation whose shareholders, presumably, voted to min-max the humanity-destruction budget.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The service station is basically your inexplicably cheerful crafting workshop, complete with happy tinkling music. You can take a breather here, check out your loot from the day, “recycle” unwanted items, and use the parts to 3D-print new gear – from health packs to flashlights or even new shoes. You can also mend the wear-and-tear wrought on your gear throughout the day. Did you rip up your pants sliding down dunes butt-first? Repair ‘em here.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/hello-sunshine-nomad-robot-meet-1764881256232.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sunshine building also acts as a robot maintenance site, allowing you to make repairs or upgrade the big guy. As I mentioned previously, it pretty much ignores you in the early stages – but if you impress it enough with your ongoing care, it may begin to care about you too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You won’t want to stray far at night, though, as it gets chilly. The preview didn’t demonstrate any “night runs,” but that’s apparently something you’ll be able to do, which could be a nice (or fraught) accompaniment to the day journeys – no word on how optional these runs may be, or whether they’ll offer different rewards (or even plot developments).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the story unfolds during these night sequences; start a campfire and strangers just may show up. The preview didn’t show interactions with any of these strangers, but they may or may not be very nice people. Regardless of whether they turn out to be friends or meanies, they will unveil parts of the Sunshine corporation’s mysterious origins.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">In short: shade wins</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/hello-sunshine-sitting-hand-1764881256232.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sunshine rest stop was where our preview ended – though we were told that the player would progress through different biomes over the following in-game days. Since I only saw the desert area, the wildly different weather conditions of various other environments may really transform what to expect in the lead-up to release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though I only saw part of the single-player campaign, there will also be co-op (split-screen and online); buddy up, and you will both experience a reframed version of the story. It’s recommended you do this after the main campaign so you can get the full story behind whatever the heck is going on in this world. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The wildly different weather conditions of various other environments may really transform what to expect in the lead-up to release.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hello Sunshine is the studio’s first foray into both the RPG and survival genres, so will their narrative pedigree see it through? I like their chances based on what I’ve seen so far. Everyone loves a good “evil corporation” story, and I honestly still can’t get over how cool those dawn-to-dusk shadow mechanics are (I can imagine other game designers thinking, “Damn, why didn’t I think of that?!”). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If your overall question about Hello Sunshine is “Does it look good?” then yes, it is very promising. And if it’s “Will I melt to death holding a handmade bow?” the answer is still yes – but enthusiastically.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/hello-sunshine-is-survival-worth-sweating-for]]></content:encoded>
