            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The most expensive Pokémon card in the world has been put up for sale by Logan Paul, the wrestler and influencer who previously paid $5.3 million for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paul's mint condition, PSA 10-rated Pikachu Artist holds the Guinness World Record as the most expensive Pokémon trading card in existence — but it seems like the card could now be sold for an even higher amount. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you have a few million dollars spare to make a bid, Paul has said he'll add to the card's value by throwing in a bejeweled chain (which he says is worth another $75,000) and hand deliver it to the auction's ultimate winner. Paul wore the card and chain during his WWE debut at WrestleMania 38, and again for his bout against Anthony Joshua in Miami last month.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/07/gettyimages-2250850216-1767791039243.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Logan Paul and his $5.3 million Pikachu Illustrator card.

Only 40 copies of the Pikachu Illustrator card were ever manufactured, and given away to winners of a 1998 Japanese fan contest. Of these, only one has been given the unsurpassable PSA 10 quality rating — and it's this card that Paul bought back in 2021 in an exchange for a lower-grade Pikachu Illustrator (valued at $1.275 million) alongside $4 million in cash.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the ranks of expensive collectible card game sales, Paul's $5.3 million card stands several million higher than anything else, including a Magic: The Gathering Black Lotus sold in 2024 for $3 million in bitcoin. The only question now is how high this new auction reaches. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cannily, Paul has set the sale to end next month, in the run-up to the 30th anniversary of the Pokémon franchise, when excitement around the brand will be at its peak. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-pokmon-fans-expect-a-gen-10-reveal-next-month-fat-pikachu-heralds-30th-anniversary-celebrations">Fans are expecting a major announcement by The Pokémon Company</a>, with new video games and a 10th generation of the franchise's creatures anticipated, alongside more details of the promising-looking Pokémon life simulation spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a mysterious countdown timer on Amazon’s official website for its Fallout TV series that is set to unlock when the Season 2 finale comes out — but fans think it might also signal the shadowdrop of a Fallout 3 or New Vegas remaster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The countdown is live now on a <a href="https://fallout-s2.amazonstudios.com/#main" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> designed to look like a Fallout map. On it are locations in the Fallout map style which, when accessed, lead you to behind-the-scenes information on the show. For example, The Vault 33 outer door, from which Lucy first steps foot into the wasteland, is on the south of the map. The Caswennan, the airship that serves as a soaring fortress for the Brotherhood of Steel, is to the east. And up there in the top right is the locked point of interest alongside the timer, which points to February 4.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/07/fallout-main-1767786059781.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The countdown on Amazon's Fallout website.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the day the Season 2 finale airs. So, it could just be pointing to a behind-the-scenes hub for the final episode. Perhaps it will reveal a teaser for Season 3, which is already confirmed. Or, as some Fallout fans hope, it will point to a Fallout video game remaster release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Bethesda follow The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and release a remaster of Fallout 3 or New Vegas? In a recent interview with IGN, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-chief-todd-howard-says-fallout-is-the-franchise-that-were-doing-the-most-in-right-now-coy-on-potential-return-to-new-vegas-or-a-fallout-3-remaster-while-fans-wait-for-fallout-5"><u>Howard remained coy on the possibility</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We asked Howard if the success of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which has seen over 4 million players since it shadowdropped last year, was a repeatable trick for a Fallout 3 Remastered. Howard kept his cards close to his chest, and reiterated a point he’s been making a lot in interviews lately.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I will just say that the Oblivion Remaster, we're really, really pleased with how well it did, it was a very long project too, and not just in how it was received, the ability to shadowdrop it, and the response to doing that,” he said. “I like to do that with games as much as possible. I love the moment that you find out about a game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no mention made during the recent Fallout Day broadcast of a Fallout: New Vegas remaster, which some (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remaster-new-vegas-boss-danny-trejo-calls-on-bethesda-to-give-fallout-fans-what-they-really-want"><u>including Danny Trejo!</u></a>) had called on Bethesda to develop. Indeed, there were no new Fallout games announced at all. Find out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-day-2025-everything-announced-live"><u>everything announced during the Fallout Day broadcast here</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are all sorts of rumors floating around about potential Fallout remakes now that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is out the door (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>Fallout 3 Remastered was leaked back in 2023</u></a>, but those plans may have changed). And we know Bethesda wants to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5"><u>Fallout 5</u></a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2, Episode 1 Video Game Details - Items and Iconography</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"There’s nothing to tease / preview they haven’t even begun filming yet," one fan said, discounting a Season 3 reveal for the countdown. "I know you guys are being cynical to avoid getting let down but there’s a chance this is actually something."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Please be at least a Fallout 3 remaster as beautiful as Oblivion," added another fan. "Give us something please. I know it will be 20 years before we see another new Fallout."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which was released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76. While fans flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG over time (and after a rocky launch), it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series leveled up in terms of attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

The final battle involves our heroes taking on the Mind Flayer from various positions and using various weapons, while a smaller strike team heads inside to face off against Vecna himself and rescue the kidnapped children.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out Matt Duffer, co-creator and co-showrunner of Stranger Things, was playing Baldur’s Gate 3 when he and his brother, Ross Duffer, were working out how the final battle would go down, and Larian’s much-loved party-based role-playing game influenced how it would play out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with Variety, Matt Duffer pointed to D&amp;D and Baldur’s Gate 3 (Baldur’s Gate 3 is of course an official D&amp;D video game, using its rules for combat and set in its universe).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We were thinking about D&amp;D, and I was playing Baldur’s Gate 3 at the time, and we felt it was very important that the only way for them to defeat it was for the entire party to work together,” Matt Duffer explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Everyone had fully realized — either through self-acceptance or they’ve resolved all their various issues — moving into that final battle, they’re absolutely primed. They’re the ultimate team, and it’s the party working all together to defeat this thing. And they each have their own individual skills, right? And that’s where I go back to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and something like Baldur’s Gate. Because that’s how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable. Lots of video game references were applied to that final battle.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Stranger Things Season 5 Finale Trailer Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In Baldur’s Gate 3, players control not only their created character, but its now-famous companion characters in combat. The likes of Shadowheart, the half-elf Cleric, Astarion, the high elven Rogue, and Karlach, the Tiefling Barbarian, all bring different skills to the table, and finding ways to make the most of them in tough boss fights is part of the fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, the heroes of Stranger Things bring their own skills to bear in the final battle. Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) uses her powers to carve a path inside the Mind Flayer and battle Vecna. Meanwhile, Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) suggests the others spread out, flank it on all sides, “Just chip away at its hit points.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer), doing her best Rambo impression, uses her gun skills to get the Mind Flayer’s attention, while the rest of the team ambush it from above. Jonathan Byers (Charlie Heaton) uses a flame thrower, while others throw molotov cocktails and other bombs. Steve and Dustin strike from below using melee weapons. Then Will comes in with his powers to help finish the job.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the Duffer Brothers’ revelation, Larian boss Swen Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2008573846526529945" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to social media</a> to say, “That’s pretty cool.” Larian publishing director Michael Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2008575148501368920" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added</a>: “Damn now I really should watch Stranger Things…”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, some fans have taken issue with the Stranger Things final battle, wondering where all the Demogorgons were when Vecna needed them most. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-were-the-demogorgons-in-the-stranger-things-final-battle-the-duffer-brothers-have-an-explanation-for-that">The Duffer Brothers have an explanation for that</a>.
