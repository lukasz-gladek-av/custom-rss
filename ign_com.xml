            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plus, the classic enemy inspired by Zelda.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> director Koshi Nakanishi has revealed that Capcom was initially unsure whether Switch 2 would be powerful enough to run its new survival horror blockbuster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new Creator's Voice episode posted to Nintendo's <a href="https://t.co/7mvmM5IylO" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> channel, Nakanishi said the game's development team had been "skeptical" about Switch 2's ability to run Requiem after first seeing its form factor — but quickly decided it would be able to run the full game "as-is" after doing a "triple take."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Nintendo Switch 2 system has improved graphical specs, so we wondered if Requiem could run on it — and it did, with ease," Nakanishi said. "When we, the dveelopment team, first saw it in our hands, we were skeptical too, so we had to do a triple take. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We thought to ourselves, 'Oh, is this really running on Nintendo Switch 2?'" he continued. "It all worked so smoothly that we decided to just go ahead with the game as-is and make it for the system. With specs like these in handheld mode, it looks great."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem launches this Friday, February 27 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch 2 on the same day. While many recent Resident Evil games have found their way to Nintendo platforms, Requiem marks the first time since 2012's Resident Evil Revelations that a new entry in the series has debuted on a Nintendo console at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's been a really long time since we've had a new Resident Evil game released on a Nintendo platform on the same day as other platforms," Nakanishi noted, "so I'm hopeful that this will give people who don't normally play Resident Evil a chance to try it out. I would be happy if these people could realize things like 'So this is what Resident Evil is like as a game' or 'This is what's interesting about it.'"</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/24/scarmiglione-1771945001274.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Resident Evil: Requiem's Scarmiglione enemy, inspired by Zelda's Iron Knuckle.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Separately, Nakanishi confirmed that a classic enemy from earlier game Resident Evil: Revelations was actually based on a foe from The Legend of Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link. The armored Scarmiglione, pictured above, moves its shield-like arm to block your aim — a tactic Nakanishi says was copied from Zelda's knights (technically they're called Iron Knuckles) who also moved their shield to stop Link's arrows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Actually, when I was making Resident Evil Revelations, there was an enemy called a Scarmiglione who carried a shield, and if you aimed at them, they would move the shield up and down," Nakanishi revealed. "The truth is, this enemy was inspired by the armored soldier from Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link. This is the first time I've said that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With just days to go until the game's release, full spoilers for its story have flooded the internet, and Capcom has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-pledges-firm-action-following-widespread-resident-evil-requiem-leaks-begs-fans-not-to-ruin-excitement-for-others"><u>promised "firm action" against those responsible</u></a>. The company said it believed the "large number of gameplay videos" now floating around the internet — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-faces-uphill-battle-to-stop-resident-evil-requiem-leaks-as-ending-spoilers-and-videos-appear-online"><u>some of which contain huge spoilers and clips of the game's finale</u></a>, which IGN verified as legitimate — originated from copies obtained "through illegal means." Yesterday, Resident Evil 2 director and famed developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-leakers-deserve-a-thousand-deaths-hideki-kamiya-says">Hideki Kamiya said those who revel in ruining surprises for others "deserve a thousand deaths"</a> and "be cursed to never be able to play games again."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch Rush is a brand new mobile title from Blizzard that it describes as an “entirely new game - not a port.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Overwatch has seen somewhat of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-confirms-overwatch-just-had-its-best-weekend-player-count-in-a-year-across-all-platforms-as-season-1-officially-goes-live"><u>a resurgence in recent weeks</u></a>, thanks to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-ditching-the-2-amid-launch-of-new-story-driven-era-with-10-new-heroes"><u>an overhaul of the nearly 10-year-old hero shooter that saw it lose the “2” from its title</u></a>, add five new heroes, and revamp its menus and approach to storytelling. And it seems Blizzard isn’t keen on letting that momentum slip anytime soon, with the announcement of the whole new game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch Rush is a “top-down hero shooter designed specifically for mobile set in the Overwatch universe” that is crucially not just a port of the PC and console game, but its own project being crafted by the Diablo and Warcraft studio.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Overwatch Rush Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Overwatch Rush is being developed by a dedicated team at Blizzard, separate from Team 4, all of whom have deep mobile experience,” a press release states. “Team 4 remains fully focused on Overwatch, which will continue to bring exciting and fresh new experiences for PC and console players in its recently launched Season 1 and beyond!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A short previewvideo showcasing early development gameplay has also been shared, which shows that classic Overwatch action from a new perspective, as the camera hovers above fan-favorite heroes like Mercy, Reinhardt, and Tracer as they compete on the South Korean Busan map. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A control scheme can also be seen on screen, suggesting that your left finger will be used to control the movement of these characters, while their primary fire and skill buttons sit to the right of the frame. From this early glimpse, it certainly looks like Overwatch’s frantic 5v5 action, albeit at a slightly more casual pace.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Updates on the project are promised soon, with Blizzard going on to confirm that “as we prepare for testing Overwatch Rush in select countries and regions, check out our official Discord server for updates on the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While there remains a lot of work to do, we’re eager to see how players enjoy what we’ve built so far, and to hear from them on what we should focus on in the coming phases of development. Our mission is to continue to expand the Overwatch universe by bringing fresh new adventures to players across all platforms. We'll continue to keep you updated on how things are progressing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I, personally, haven’t stopped playing Overwatch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/domina-from-overwatch-will-you-be-my-valentine"><u>ever since my beloved Domina entered the game</u></a> a couple of weeks ago, so if I’m given the opportunity to carry on playing when I’m out of the house, it really could cause trouble for me.
