            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> a soulslike? It’s a question <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nobody-knows-what-a-soulslike-is-silent-hill-f-sparks-heated-debate-within-the-fandom">the Silent Hill fandom has been debating for some time now</a>. But in a recent interview with IGN, Konami insisted it's not, and expressed a degree of frustration with the ongoing debate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f takes us to 1960s Japan, where we follow Hinako Shimizu, a teenager struggling under the pressure of expectations from her friends, family, and society. As IGN reported in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-we-played-it-for-5-hours">Silent Hill f hands-on preview</a>, its combat has a similar feel to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake"><u>Silent Hill 2 Remake</u></a>’s close-range combat. You can dodge enemy attacks with the DualSense’s circle button and activate a light and heavy attack with R1 and R2, respectively. Your limited reach and lengthy attack motions give a realistic, weighty feel to combat. Heavy attacks, especially, feel slow and need to be timed well, "contributing to the feeling that Hinako is just a teenager with limited strength."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, Silent Hill f’s combat also features timed dodges and counterattacks, with the latter particularly important in combat sequences. Enemies briefly show a sign when a counterattack can be utilized, but we suggested that "unless you have trained your reflex skills by playing games like of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice"><u>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</u></a>, you will likely have a hard time reacting." That’s where the Focus mode comes in, which can be triggered by holding L2. It allows counterattacks to last longer, while also charging up a power attack that staggers an enemy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talk of parries and counterattacks has come as a surprise to some Silent Hill fans, and Konami’s suggestion that Silent Hill f's combat sequences were ratcheted up because "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-is-combat-heavy-because-challenging-action-games-are-gaining-popularity-among-younger-players-nowadays"><u>challenging action games are gaining popularity among younger players nowadays</u></a>" has split the fandom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in an interview with IGN at gamescom 2025, Silent Hill producer Motoi Okamoto set the record straight. He insisted Silent Hill f is not a soulslike, despite the mechanics at play in its combat, and even said applying that label to the game is "disingenuous."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is one of the things that we see — the term soulslike — being thrown around on the internet quite a bit,” he began. “And I think it’s a label that’s a little bit disingenuous. Modern players will see like, oh there’s a stamina meter, there’s a dodge, and they're like, ‘Okay, it’s a soulslike.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But to be very honest, a lot of these things we actually pulled from classic Silent Hill titles. Look at Silent Hill 4 — there’s a charge meter for your attacks, kind of like our Focus meter. And even for Silent Hill 3 there's a stamina meter. You see it later on.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okamoto went on to say Silent Hill f’s combat mechanics aren’t exclusive to the soulslike genre, expressing a degree of frustration with the online dialogue surrounding the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These things aren’t new and exclusive to soulslike games,” he said. “They’ve been a part of action horror games for a very, very long time. If you have these things you’re labeled a soulslike. And we’d like to reiterate we are an action horror game, but we are not a soulslike.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f comes out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on September 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Mirage returned to the Assassin's Creed franchise's smaller, stealthier city-set roots for an adventure that felt inspired by the series' initial game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Ubisoft Bordeaux, the game originally began life as an expansion for Valhalla focused on its mysterious Assassin character Basim, someone who ends up playing a pivotal role in the events of that game's finale. Fans had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-developers-discuss-series-modern-day-future-basim-and-why-theres-no-new-isu-artifact">subsequently hoped to see more from the character</a>, though it's unclear if this add-on will include any new answers to his ultimate fate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Mirage was released, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creeds-wild-meta-story-might-be-getting-even-stranger-soon">players found an odd post-credits scene hidden in the game's files</a> that Ubisoft has since acknowledged, though never fully explained. Perhaps this too will finally be addressed in Mirage's upcoming new content, more details of which will follow in the weeks to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-expansion-claws-of-awaji-release-date-revealed">Assassin's Creed Shadows, meanwhile, is the game's big Claws of Awaji expansion</a>, curiously also developed by Ubisoft Bordeaux, that's due for launch on September 16.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There are so many different ways to experience The Witcher these days. My own entry point into this world was playing through the first Witcher game back when it first came out in 2007. But it wasn't until The Witcher 3 that I really felt the depth of the story. I loved exploring the world, playing Gwent, and getting an up close and personal look at Geralt's complicated love life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I got a similar feeling with the first couple of seasons of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-witcher">The Witcher series on Netflix</a>, but now that Henry Cavill has left the show I find myself mostly just looking forward to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv">next Witcher game</a> in the franchise. Since that game is still years away, however, I've been recently looking into The Witcher TTRPG as a potential new way to experience that world. It's currently only $15 for a six-book bundle at Humble Bundle and it certainly looks intriguing at that price.</p><div catalogid="af01313a-a9f9-4c39-b028-cf6df9563c2e" id="227219"><div id="227219" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Six digital books included</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Witcher TTRPG Bundle</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">What comes with this bundle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This Witcher TTRPG bundle includes a total of six books. You can get the full bundle by spending $15 or you can choose to pay more and support charity. According to the website, this bundle supports <a href="https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Children's Miracle Network Hospitals</a>. Here's all of the digital books included with your purchase:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Witcher TTRPG Core Rulebook</li><li>The Witcher: A Book of Tales</li><li>The Witcher: Tome of Chaos</li><li>The Witcher: A Witcher's Journal</li><li>The Witcher: Lords &amp; Lands</li><li>The Witcher TTRPG - Easy Mode</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Is The Witcher TTRPG worth playing?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Witcher Tabletop RPG was created by <a href="https://rtalsoriangames.com/witcher-trpg/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R. Talsorian Games</a> in collaboration with CD Projekt Red. The core game is set somewhere between <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings">The Witcher 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> on the video game timeline. Since I haven't had the chance to play the game myself, I did a bit of digging into reviews and Reddit threads to see if it's worth playing. The <a href="https://spritesanddice.com/reviews/witcher-ttrpg-review/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most comprehensive review</a> I could find comes from a site called Sprites and Dice. The author goes into a lot of detail about the core rule book and subsequent books available while looking at it through the lens of an experienced D&amp;D player. I recommend checking that out if you need a deeper look at what you'll get with this bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a pretty <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/fd9ecn/opinions_on_the_witcher_ttrpg/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">helpful Reddit thread</a> I found where multiple people have given their thoughts about this TTRPG. A common theme throughout that is that those who actually played it enjoyed it overall. One user complimented the character creation involved while pointing out the imbalances in some of the classes. Basically, if you don't decide to be a Witcher or a Mage you won't get the chance to engage with the full rulebook.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Disclosure</strong></em><em>: Humble Bundle is part of IGN Entertainment, the division of Ziff Davis that includes GamesIndustry.biz, IGN, and MapGenie.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 22, 2025 11:45 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-tabletop-rpg-books-are-only-15-at-humble-bundle-right-now]]></content:encoded>

Ubisoft calls the new content “an updated take on the survival extraction experience” that is currently “in the early stages” of development. Aiding as creative director for Survivors is Magnus Jansén, who previously served as creative director on the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division"><u>The Division</u></a>.

We are doing cool, new things.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He admits there’s little else to reveal, considering The Division 2: Survivors is so early in development. However, Jansén does have one note to leave fans with: “But what I will say, and this is like a teaser, is that a hint to, maybe, the biggest new thing we’re doing is right there in the name.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, I’ll just leave that there, and then I’ll be back next year,” he added.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tom Clancy's The Division 2: Survivors Concept Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll have to wait at least a few months to get a first look at The Division 2: Survivors. It’s release date on the roadmap is currently listed as “TBA,” so don’t expect its arrival until later in 2026 at the earliest. However, Ubisoft did provide eager fans with a first look at concept art (above), which may offer more hints about some of the scenarios players can find themselves in when Survivors eventually launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Division 2: Survivors is as much your baby as it is ours, and we strive for transparency during its development,” executive producer Julian Gerighty said in a statement. “Clear communication and community involvement are a focus as we build the new experience, and we will be closely involving you as we move forward on the development journey.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Division Resurgence</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Also included in today’s gamescom The Division announcements was an update on Ubisoft’s upcoming free-to-play mobile RPG MMO, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-resurgence"><u>The Division Resurgence</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When you’ve played video games long enough, you eventually develop something of a “Spidey Sense” when you see a game that seems like it’s going to be extra special. You never know until the final product is on your hard drive, of course, but more often than not, that sixth sense is correct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Replaced, a 2.5D action-adventure game drenched in an absolutely stunning sci-fi cyberpunk pixel-art aesthetic – complete with incredible camera work and moody music – is making that Spidey Sense tingle. I’d already played a brief three-part demo over a year ago, which only reinforced that feeling I first got after the initial reveal four years ago. This time I got to play the first 30 or so minutes of the campaign, and it did nothing to dampen my enthusiasm for what could be – if the rest of the game delivers – an all-time indie classic in the same category as Limbo, Braid, Inside, Balatro, etc.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Right from the jump it’s obvious that Replaced’s art director knows what the heck they’re doing. The look of this dystopia, set in an alternate-history 1980s America, takes the 16-bit graphics I grew up with and plusses them up with soft dynamic lighting and some absolutely brilliant cinematography. Toss in just the right amount of depth of field and you get a world that looks lived-in. It oozes griminess and despair but somehow makes them look gorgeous. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Replaced is set in an alternate-history 1980s America and takes the 16-bit graphics I grew up with and plusses them up with soft dynamic lighting and some absolutely brilliant cinematography.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as R.E.A.C.H., an AI that lives in the body of a man named Warren, who wakes up after having been literally left for dead amongst a pile of corpses. The world of Phoenix City you see before you is the evolution of a worldwide nuclear event that occurred several decades prior. There are diaries, news articles, and other ephemeral bits of world-building information scattered around for you to collect and read in your Wingman – think of it as this cyberpunk world’s version of a 1980’s Walkman-meets-Palm-Pilot.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Replaced starts simply enough, keeping you on a left-to-right 2D plane, old-school-style, and having you do little more than some basic platforming. But it establishes its setting so amazingly well – and quickly to boot. Whether it’s the aforementioned digital clippings revealing pieces of the radiation-coated backstory or the searchlight-wielding snipers who will gun you down in one shot if they spot you, things are clearly grim in Phoenix City. Before long you’ll have to fight to survive, as you’ll be forced to throw hands with a couple of faction members and soon entire gangs of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s where Replaced will next impress you: it’s packing a proper Batman: Arkham combat system. Enemies who are about to attack will get a yellow lightning bolt over their heads. Press Y when you see that to instantly counter them. And then – my fellow Arkham veterans know where this is going – when a red lightning bolt appears over a foe’s head, that means they’re about to unleash an unblockable/uncounter-able attack, and you need to press the A button at just the right moment in order to dodge-roll away. Successful dodges and parries charge up a special-attack meter, which in Replaced’s case, means you get to either fire a shot from your found firearm at distance, or brutally execute an enemy if you’re at point-blank range. Of course, it’ll get more complicated; before long rifle-wielding bad guys will enter the fray, and the timing window changes on their (obviously) unblockable bullets. Enemy heavies will complicate things too. There was just one in the opening minutes of Replaced, and, probably by design, he wasn’t too tough to tango with. All of his attacks are unblockable, and he takes a ton of hits to bring down, but he didn’t have friends left by the time we faced off, so it was a very straightforward introduction to the higher-hit-point heavies you’ll face off against later in the game. So I expect the fisticuffs to ramp up significantly over the course of Replaced’s runtime in every sense of the word: number of enemies, difficulty, etc.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Soon Replaced began introducing the 2.5D elements, literally expanding its world by letting me walk to the background or foreground to get something I needed to progress onwards. You’ll need to grab onto dumpsters to slide them around in order to climb up on them to reach a higher ladder, or to bridge a gap, just as one example. While this opening sequence didn’t offer me too much freedom of movement within the environment, I know it eventually will, because I’ve seen it before in last year’s demo. I should add, though, that exploring will sometimes reward you with pickups that are often tucked out of plain sight – I won’t go so far as to call them secrets – and they’ll fill out your dossier and shed a little bit more light on this broken world, or give you an upgrade. I wouldn’t go so far as to say that Replaced is going to have replayability, per se, but if the developers do an awesome enough job at building out the backstory of Phoenix City, that might deliver enough motivation to want to go back and find all of the hidden bits of information. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Replaces is packing a proper Batman: Arkham combat system. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This year’s demo – again, since it was the very beginning of the game – also didn’t show off the biggest pleasant surprise from my initial hands-on with it last year: the RPG hiding under its 2.5D cyberpunk aesthetic. From the first couple of extremely impressive trailers, I’d thought that Replaced was “just” a side-scrolling action-adventure game. But no, it’s got sections packed with quest-giving NPCs and the ability to free-roam the area. I absolutely can’t wait to dig into more of this.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But getting back to this newest slice of Replaced, I should take a moment to compliment the music. A moody synth soundtrack is key to nailing the vibe in any dystopian cyberpunk piece of media, and Replaced wastes no time confirming it understands the assignment in that department. And I’d actually like to get back to the visual identity of this game for a second as well. The pixel art, as you can already tell, is phenomenal, and the use of color and lighting is top-shelf, but I’d also like to shout out the animation. I’m not sure if this will make sense, but in attempting a retro look complemented by modern visual touches like in Replaced, there is such a thing as the animation being too good. I would argue that the development team at Sad Cat Studios has struck a perfect balance here. Neither R.E.A.C.H. nor his enemies move too smoothly. Instead, they have a slightly stilted movement to them, which only adds to the broken, beat-down spirit of Phoenix City, and it sells the neo-16-bit look even more perfectly, in my eyes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I reached the end of the demo build of Replaced, all I wanted was to play more. It is simply a captivating game from top to bottom, and I can’t wait to see where R.E.A.C.H.’s story goes as well as what the deeper plot reveals. I’m also eager to find out how much deeper the combat and RPG elements specifically go. I’d love nothing more than for my Spidey Sense to prove correct and for Replaced to be one of the best and most memorable games of 2026 (even if we already know that Grand Theft Auto 6 will dominate the headlines). We don’t have a release date for Replaced quite yet, but I get the sense that it’s close. Hopefully we’ll soon find out exactly when we can see just how special the final game is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.
