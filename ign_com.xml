The first such game was released in 2008, and it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dissidia-final-fantasy-review"><u>returned a Great 8.9/10</u></a>. From what we can tell from the new <a href="https://www.square-enix.com/ddff/en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teaser site</u></a> set up by publisher Square Enix, though, this is a "Team Boss Battle Arena" that will only be coming to iOS and Android mobile devices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Square Enix plans to tell us more on October 14, fans have already been scouring the mini-site, which one suggesting the silhouetted roster teaser image <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/1o4eray/teaser_of_the_new_dissidias_roster/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could include key Final Fantasy characters</a> like Edward or Kain, Terra, Warrior of Light, Lightning, Tinoa, Cloud, and more, all "redesigned characters with modern outfits."  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also can see five images of the game's gorgeous environment art on the website, which we've embedded below for you:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dissidia Final Fantasy Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction is mixed. For instance, in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/1o4uk1x/comment/nj5fc3b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit thread dedicated to the new game</u></a>, one unimpressed player advised: "no one join. Let this game burn in the hell of EoS after one month." Another thread called "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/1o4ilbw/excited_about_new_dissidia_news_just_to_see_its/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Excited about new Dissidia news just to see it’s more mobile game nonsense</u></a>" says: "Please Square even just a modern port of Duodecim so that I don’t have to see another live service slop you keep insisting just so you can shut down its servers again for the nth time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not everyone's so pessimistic, though — "if it is half as good as Dissidia Opera Omnia, I'm ready to open the wallet," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/1o4ilbw/comment/nj32k11/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote this fan</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever it is, we don't have to wait long to hear more: Square Enix said we'll find out more at 3am PT/6am ET on October 14 — you'll be able to watch the reveal on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLM7V3jrNNc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"This bodes totally well."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Go's big week where it finally raises the game's level cap is off to a bad start. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This morning, the game's first ever Weekly Challenge went live — a new feature tasking fans with forming a group of four players to, this week, catch 500 creatures in return for rewards. But the new gameplay feature has been pulled after just a couple of hours, as eager fans who completed the goal quickly reported finding their games suddenly "bricked," and unresponsive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with the feature disabled, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> players impacted by the bug say they remain unable to play — suggesting a more meaningful fix now needs to be rolled out. And all of this comes less than 48 hours before Pokémon Go's huge level 80 update is switched on — something fans are now concerned may end up delayed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/NianticHelp/status/1977645454012620877" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> posted to the game's Niantic Support account on X just minutes ago, the developer admitted it had disabled the new Weekly Challenge feature, as it had become "aware of an issue where some users are unable to close the Weekly Challenge completion popup, preventing them from continuing gameplay."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have temporarily disabled the Weekly Challenge feature as we investigate the issue," the message continued. "We’ll share an update soon."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on top Pokémon fan reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1o5d4ql/weekly_challenge_has_ended_for_everyone/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheSilphRoad</a>, fans who completed their Weekly Challenge say they are "completely locked out" from playing, as loading the game still re-opens the Weekly Challenge screen, which then blocks everything else. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I tried opening the game on an old Android tablet and was able to dismiss the page with the Android back button," wrote fan Gerkenator. "However it returns every time open the game." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others say they've tried deleting and reinstalling the game to no avail. "They really said Pokémon Go Do Something Else," noted Klecktacular.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Pokémon Go's developer investigates the issue, fans fear the impact this latest problem will have on the game's seismic levelling update that's currently scheduled to hit on Wednesday, October 15. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously announced, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-go-boosting-level-cap-and-rebalancing-experience-in-first-major-xp-change-for-5-years">this update will rebalance XP across the entire game and increase its level cap for the first time in five years, from level 50 to level 80</a>. New levelling challenges and rewards will be added, while others will be retired. Players' existing levels will also shift to accomodate a new, smoother levelling curve — with many expected to automatically increase. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, with less than 48 hours to go and an emergency fix for the game's Weekly Challenge feature now seemingly required, it remains to be seen if the big XP update also arrives as planned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This bodes totally well for the level update coming this week," wrote aznknight613. "Meanwhile, the level 80 updates arrives in NZ in like... 27 hours..." noted Brock_Hard_Canuck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll keep an eye on how things are going, and update when we have more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
