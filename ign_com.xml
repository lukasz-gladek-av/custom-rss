            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> sales are in-line with Ghost of Tsushima’s in Europe, new data shows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/ghost-of-yotei-delivers-strong-opening" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a>, Ghost of Yotei debuted at No.2 in the GSD European charts behind EA’s FC 26.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has yet to announce a sales figure for Ghost of Yotei, which launched exclusively on PlayStation 5 on October 2, 2025. But we now know that in Europe it’s doing about as well as its predecessor, which launched in 2020 exclusively on PlayStation 4. That is, for its first few days on sale, as the GSD European chart runs to October 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of things worth noting here. Not only did Ghost of Tsushima launch on a console with a bigger install base at that point than PS5 has now, it launched during the pandemic, which saw record video game sales and player numbers as people were forced to stay at home during lockdowns.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Business noted that Ghost of Yotei is the biggest first-party PlayStation launch since Spider-Man 2 in October 2023. Helldivers 2, which launched February 2024, remains the fastest selling PlayStation Studios game of all time, with an incredible 12 million sold in 12 weeks. The question is whether Ghost of Yotei will end up meeting Sony's sales expectations over time; Ghost of Tsushima ended up a hugely successful release, with over 13 million sold as of September 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it shines a light on just how few new games Sony’s first-party studios have released over the last few years. Since Insomniac’s Spider-Man 2 came out in October 2023, we’ve had the aforementioned Helldivers 2, the disastrous Concord, Team Asobi’s wonderful Astro Bot, Lego Horizon Adventures, MLB The Show 25, and a bunch of remasters. Naughty Dog has seemingly skipped the PS5 generation entirely in terms of brand new games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First-party Sony games we know to be in the works include Bungie’s Marathon, Housemarque’s Saros, Insomniac’s Marvel’s Wolverine, Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, Haven’s Fairgames, and a multiplayer Horizon game from Guerrilla. A whole bunch of Sony first-party games were canceled as the company's live-service push faltered, including a multiplayer The Last of Us game, a live-service God of War game, and another live-service title from Bend Studio. Bend's last brand new game was 2019’s Days Gone on PlayStation 4, which launched on PC in 2021.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But how has Ghost of Yotei done in the U.S.? According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m33ifb42gk2w" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mat Piscatella</a>, senior director at Circana, Ghost of Yotei ranked 12th on its Top 15 Titles by Total Weekly Active Users chart for the week ending October 4, with 4.4% of active PlayStation players giving it a go. Coincidentally, Ghost of Tsushima also ranked 12th in its launch week back in 2020 with 4.4% of active PlayStation players engaging. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it sounds like Ghost of Yotei has done about as well as Ghost of Tsushima did, at least at launch. It will be interesting to see if Sony says anything about its performance in upcoming financial reports, and how sales hold up in the coming weeks as we head into the crucial holiday season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what’s next from developer Sucker Punch, in an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-will-remain-a-single-project-studio-after-ghost-of-yotei-boss-suggests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>, co-founder and studio head, Brian Fleming, said the studio will decide its next project once the multiplayer add-on Ghost of Yotei: Legends comes out in 2026. But, he suggested, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/if-we-were-good-at-juggling-four-projects-yeah-wed-have-a-remaster-ghost-of-yotei-dev-sucker-punch-says-it-will-remain-a-single-project-studio">don’t expect a flurry of games from the relatively lean developer — it’s one project at a time</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out, check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-review">Ghost of Yotei review</a>.

The entire track can be heard in the mission Dear Uncle Tacitus, in an impactful segment when you're riding a horse back to camp. It boasts over 55 million streams on Spotify alone.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/15/gettyimages-528806919-1760521801919.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Photo by Frans Schellekens/Redferns.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">D'Angelo was a huge fan of video games and would visit Rockstar during Red Dead Redemption 2's development after reportedly reaching out to Ivan Pavlovich, director of music and audio at the studio, through an intermediary, to "just play the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We weren’t even talking about doing music,” Pavlovich told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/dangelo-red-dead-redemption-2-767748/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>RollingStone</u></a> in 2018. "When D’Angelo comes through, he shows up at midnight, and he’s playing the game until four in the morning. Each time he was just like, ‘It’s incredible.’ It just blows his mind. He’s such a fan. I have never seen someone that excited. D’Angelo’s actually a massive, massive, massive fan of the game — more than I ever knew." It was because of this that Pavlovich asked if D'Angelo would be interested in contributing to the soundtrack, which is partly why there are some vocal tracks on an otherwise chiefly instrumental score. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dozens of artists have paid tribute to the musician, including Flavor Fave, Beyoncé, Nile Rodgers, Lauren Hill, and Doja Cat, but so have hundreds of gamers, some of whom were introduced to D'Angelo's music through Red Dead Redemption 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> players haven’t decided what their favorite weapons are yet, but they’ve already fallen in love with a new movement tech called “ladder launching.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To catch you up to speed, the ladder is a gadget available to use with the Assault class in Battlefield Studios and EA’s latest Battlefield game. It’s a traversal tool that can be used to reach high-up places, opening up opportunities to gain new vantage points or even sneak up on unsuspecting enemies. The thing is that now, just days after Battlefield 6 launched for PC and consoles, the ladder is also being used for much, much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve even accidentally whipped out the ladder while playing Battlefield 6 multiplayer, you might have noticed that actually mounting it can be a hassle. The bottom of the gadget bumps players around if placed at a certain angle, triggering moments that balance frustration with slapstick humor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some Assault classes in Battlefield 6 have found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o558n3/assault_ladder_is_criminally_underutilized_im/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>practical uses for the tool</u></a>, others are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o4g675/me_when_i_meet_the_ladder_of_repulsion_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>struggling to use it at all</u></a>. However, it’s a secret, third segment of the community that has pushed things even further by using those wonky physics to catapult themselves around maps.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Ladders might be broken in Battlefield 6 💀 <a href="https://t.co/OUnM6Ux1Wd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/OUnM6Ux1Wd</a></p>— Mokey (@mokeysniper) <a href="https://twitter.com/mokeysniper/status/1977115683839152535?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/mokeysniper/status/1977115683839152535" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>@mokeysniper</u></a> published a video detailing exactly how the ladder launch works, admitting that, while the move is far from a game-breaking exploit, it is quite fun to pull off. All it takes is maneuvering around the gadget at the right angle and speed, causing a chain reaction that sends players careening through the air.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, ladder launching is, mostly, practically useless in Battlefield 6. That said, some players are still finding ways to create entire montages centered around ladder launching.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Took 2 hours to break ladders in BF6 🪤🎣<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BF6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BF6</a> <a href="https://t.co/13ffncb2GH" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/13ffncb2GH</a></p>— merkwy (@merkwey) <a href="https://twitter.com/merkwey/status/1977433170334400873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Players probably should get too used to ladder launching in Battlefield 6, though, as David Sirland, lead producer at Battlefield studio DICE, has already confirmed the Battlefield Studios team has <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1977705926476918979" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>plans to deliver a patch in the future</u></a>. Considering the average player will find its bumpy edges more annoying than useful, a patch is probably a good call.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We can likely expect even more ladder launching clips to show up online while the team fixes the Assault ladder. In the meantime, you can see how other players are at least trying to use the ladder, below.
