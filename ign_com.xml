            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Were you waiting for an excuse to grab an Audible or Kindle Unlimited subscription? Well, today is your day thanks to three months for $0.99 for the former and three months free for the latter. It's an epic day for game devs and players too thanks to a cracking deal on a 32" Alienware curved gaming monitor and a massive sound bundle over on Humble.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The epic Sam's Club Pokémon TCG Classic deal is back, and it's undercutting big box stores and the collectors market by nearly $100 in some cases. I've looked up the top-valued cards from the box, so you know if it's worth it or not below. Spoiler alert, it is! Let's get into it:</p><p id="3-months-free-audible"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="3 Months Free Audible">3 Months for $0.99 Audible Deal</h2></p><div catalogid="bac8eeb1-cb76-4ce5-8784-e2fb014e64c5" id="223445"><div id="223445" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>3 Months Audible Premium Plus for $0.99</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Audible’s doing that 99c a month deal again for Premium Plus, and it’s a steal. Amazon Prime Members get three months free, so make sure to check for an active subscription before looking for this deal. You get three audiobooks to keep, full access to the big library, and it works even if you’ve had a sub before as long as it’s not active now. I just logged in, saw the banner, and grabbed it. <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em> is already in my library, and I’m eyeing that massive new Sanderson one next. Less than three bucks for all that? Easy win.</p></div><p id="3-months-free-kindle-unlimited"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited">3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited</h2></p><div catalogid="bac8eeb1-cb76-4ce5-8784-e2fb014e64c5" id="223446"><div id="223446" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve never really stuck with audiobooks before, but this Kindle Unlimited deal finally got me into them properly. Right now you can get three months free if you’ve got Prime, and it works on your phone or tablet, not just a Kindle. I gave it a go, downloaded a couple of books, and now I’ve actually started finishing them while I’m out walking or doing stuff around the house. It’s made getting through my backlog way easier and I didn’t have to pay a thing to try it. If you’ve been on the fence, this is a solid excuse to dive in.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Classic</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sam's Club Pokémon TCG Classic deal is back, and it's massively undercutting other big box retailers and the secondary market. Just for comparrison, the top four cards from this set, Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur and Mewtwo, are worth the same price as this discounted offer. This deal is well worth it and should be snapped up as soon as possible.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Stock Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As usual we're looking at over-inflated pricing at big box stores, but it's a dependable source of sealed product for trainers looking to add to their collections or rip open boosters. Although we'd recommend checking out secondary market prices first, as big retailers are now regularly selling over market value now too. I've already done the hard work for you:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TCG Player and eBay Pokémon Sealed Product</h2></p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">The Most Expensive Japanese Black Bolt White Flare Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most expensive cards from Pokémon TCG's Black Bolt and White Flare sets are already commanding serious prices in Japan. Top of the list are the Special Illustration Rares of Zekrom ex and Reshiram ex, both featuring intricate, hand-drawn artwork and fetching well over ¥20,000 (around $130–$150 USD) on the secondary market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also climbing fast are the new BWR (Black White Rare) cards and the full-art Victini promos from the themed file sets. With stunning clay and knitted art styles also making their debut, collectors are pushing prices up across the board, especially for low-population, high-style secret rares.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">This Weeks Pokémon TCG Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Black Bolt and White Flare wrapping up the Scarlet &amp; Violet era, all eyes are now on what’s next—and Mega Evolution is officially back. The Japanese Championships 2025 confirmed <em>MEGA Symphonia</em> and <em>MEGA Brave</em> as the first entries in the new Mega Expansion Packs, launching August 1 in Japan. These sets reintroduce Mega Evolution ex cards in a powerful new form, now Stage 2 Pokémon worth 3 Prize Cards when knocked out. Cards like Mega Gardevoir ex, Mega Venusaur ex, and Mega Lucario ex are leading the charge, and collectors are already snapping up classic Mega cards in anticipation of their return to the spotlight.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Live Preorders </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Preorders are now live for Magic: The Gathering’s next major set, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-preorder-guide">Edge of Eternities</a>, ahead of its August 1 release. You can lock in Play Booster Boxes, Bundles, Commander Decks, and Collector Boosters, with prices already dipping below MSRP in some spots.

Whilst sealed stock is going up in value and becoming harder to get, there's plenty of option for the most in-demand cards for your deck or collection.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Aetherdrift Chase Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-most-valuable-aetherdrift-cards">Aetherdrift</a> is one of Magic: The Gathering’s more experimental sets, blending high-speed vehicle mechanics with a bold visual style.

For $20, you get over 100 royalty-free audio packs covering everything from cinematic hits and ambient drones to meme sounds and upbeat pop tracks. I grabbed it just to have a library ready for whatever project pops up, and it’s already saved me time and cash. You can pay as little as a buck if you just want to check it out, and part of what you pay goes to charity too. Easy win if you ever mess with editing or content creation.</p></div><p id="alienware-aw3423dwf-curved-qd-oled-g"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Alienware AW3423DWF Curved QD-OLED G">Alienware AW3423DWF Curved QD-OLED Gaming Monitor</h2></p><div catalogid="bac8eeb1-cb76-4ce5-8784-e2fb014e64c5" id="223444"><div id="223444" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alienware AW3423DWF Curved QD-OLED Gaming Monitor</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Alienware 34-inch QD-OLED is down to $649.99, and it’s an absolute beast.
