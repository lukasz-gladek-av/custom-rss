            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The card-based, narrative-driven RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3117820/_/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Sultan’s Game</u></a> just dropped its latest update alongside new DLC. There’s new story content, a downloadable soundtrack, new cards, and the base game is on sale for 15% as part of the Steam Summer Sale right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who aren’t familiar with Sultan’s Game, the story begins with a tyrannical sultan who has experienced every vice and pleasure life has to offer, and he’s grown bored. But then a mysterious sorceress arrives with a card game meant only for the realm’s most powerful people. Each round of the game assigns you a Sultan Card and tasks you with destroying it, but each card has different requirements to defeat it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cards come in four different types with four different tiers within those types. The four card types are Carnality, Bloodshed, Conquest, and Extravagance. You sate Carnality cards with nights of passion, feed the hunger of Bloodshed cards with living sacrifices, fulfill Conquest cards by capturing locations, and satisfy Extravagance cards with wealth and treasure.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/stone-carnality-card-description-1751305123213.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Each card also comes in one of four tiers of increasing value: stone, bronze, silver, and gold. To defeat a Sultan Card, you must use a card of equal or higher value. So, for instance, if you need to destroy a silver Bloodshed card, then you must kill a character card that’s either silver or gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the game is played with cards, in-world those cards represent real people, so sacrificing cards means killing actual subjects. As you might expect, this is just the kind of game a tyrannical ruler would love. But you don’t play as the sultan — at least, not after the tutorial. You are one of his courtiers who had the courage to call out the game for its cruelty and depravity. Your punishment? The sultan puts you in charge of playing the game and having to make life-or-death decisions to defeat each Sultan Card. If you fail, he’ll execute you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The beginning of each round will see you draw a new Sultan Card, and you’ll have seven days to figure out how to destroy it. There are activities available each day, and you can choose which activities to send cards in your deck to do. But you’ll need to be strategic about which activities you do each day and which cards you assign to them. Seven days can go by quickly, and there are limited resources at your disposal.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/overworld-map-1751305170813.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of those activities require dice rolls to determine if your chosen cards are successful. When you end the day, text-based scenes will play out based on who did what, whether they were successful, and your rewards. The primary rewards are gold coins (which can be used to gain access to other activities) or information cards (which can be used for a variety of things), but as the game progresses, more events get added with more varied results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, the story will be shaped by how you decide to approach each task and how moral or immoral you choose to be. Will you willingly go along with the sultan or secretly plot behind his back? Will you stay loyal to your wife or spend your free time at the local brothel? How will you treat the strangers that cross your path?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/story-choice-1751305201280.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter what decisions you make, butterfly effects will follow in their wake, some of which won’t show themselves until long after you’ve made the initial choice. Some decisions might seem innocuous at first, but the story branches they open can continue branching from there and end up with wildly different outcomes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of these decisions will test your morality. That starts as soon as the game begins, when you choose the background of your main character and his wife. Are you kind and charming or strong and intimidating? Are you a slave owner (this is a sultan’s court, after all) or a more enlightened friend of the nobility? Your starting deck and stats will be determined by the choices you make during this setup, but the moral decisions only get more complicated from there.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/personal-background-1751304762377.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We won’t give any spoilers here, but we will say that there are some truly dark and extreme choices you can make, and they can dramatically alter the course of the story and the things you experience in your playthrough. You’ll have to grapple with questions like, “Who am I willing to kill?” and “What makes one person’s life more valuable than another?” Some moments might elicit excitement, others fear, and others maybe even disgust. A single playthrough takes about 10 hours, but seeing every ending can easily run you to 150+ hours, so there are lots of different paths to take.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story has an extensive script, and the latest update refined that script. It also added new Steam badges, community items, and 10 new cards crowdsourced from the community (pictured below). But the biggest new additions come in the form of two DLCs: a downloadable soundtrack and prequel story.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/items-being-added-1751304688733.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The OST features 15 original tracks by Zeta and international artists, and it’s a fusion of Uyghur Muqam, guzheng, and Western orchestration that’s meant to represent the cross-cultural atmosphere of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The prequel DLC is a digital novella called A Game for the Sultan, which will let fans read the original story that inspired development of the game. Written by the game’s lead writer, it takes place in the sultan’s court, tells a standalone story, and delves into the origin of the dreaded Sultan Cards and how they first corrupted a sultan’s court.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/novel-capsule-1751304712045.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Sultan’s Game and its DLCs are currently exclusive to PC and are available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3117820/_/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Steam</u></a>. The base game sold more than 600,000 units within its first month of release and is now approaching 1 million sales during the Steam Summer Sale. It’s also reviewed well on Steam, currently sitting at “very positive” with more than 16,000 reviews and “overwhelmingly positive” with 1,600 recent reviews. You can stay up to date on the latest info by following developer <a href="https://x.com/Doublecross_X" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Double Cross Studio on Twitter</u></a>.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/card-based-rpg-sultans-game-releases-new-update-and-dlcs]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-june-23">Pokémania 2025 isn't slowing down</a>, which means trainers need to be savvy about their sealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-cards-2025">Pokémon TCG</a> purchases. Whilst buying at MSRP is become the stuff of legend, it's always good practice to see what products are selling for on the secondary market compared to big box stores such as Amazon. The same goes for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-most-expensive-surge-foils">Magic: The Gathering</a>. Luckily, I've gone through Amazon's current stock for both and found the best deals of these products to save trainers, wizards and witches a few dollars. I'm amazing, right?</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is also gearing up for its 4-day Prime Day sale with some early deals and a massive 6-month free prime membership deal for anyone aged 18-24 in the US. then it's $7.49 thereafter. Cool, right? Speaking of staying cool, we've got a great deal on a neck fan and something to help get a cool nights sleep for way below MSRP. Let's get into it:</p><p id="amazon-prime-day-is-coming"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Amazon Prime Day Is Coming">Amazon Prime Day Is Coming</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223808"><div id="223808" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Amazon Prime Day Is Coming</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Deals are already live, Prime Day sales start July 8 and run through July 11</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We're all over Prime Days 2025, and some deals are going live now. For more information about the event and an inside scoop on hot deals and top tips, check out our Prime Day hub.</p></div><p id="6-months-free-amazon-prime-for-young"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="6 Months Free Amazon Prime For Young">6 Months Free Amazon Prime For Young Adults</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223809"><div id="223809" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>6 Months Free Amazon Prime For Young Adults</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>$7.49 after free trial ends</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one is a no-brainer. If your 18-24, snap up this 6-months free deal for Amazon Prime. It includes the free and fast delivery Amazon is known for alongside unlimited streaming, free delivery on GrubHub+, free Prime games every month and loads more.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Price Comparison</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the pricing here by Amazon is insane, but there's some deals to be had when comparing these products to TCG Player. For example, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7YM4?object_uuid=24a5da02-dcae-4d17-9365-415acfb1fd52&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prismatic Evolutions Super-Premium Collection</a> is a massive 56% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xEG5?object_uuid=24a5da02-dcae-4d17-9365-415acfb1fd52&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">market value</a>, so go with Amazon on that one. On the other end of the scale, TCG Player has <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnm1k?object_uuid=24a5da02-dcae-4d17-9365-415acfb1fd52&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cynthia’s Garchomp ex Premium Collection</a> at a massive 48% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpXZv?object_uuid=24a5da02-dcae-4d17-9365-415acfb1fd52&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon's current price</a>, which is very close to MSRP. I've compared all the prices in the carousel above, but another pro tip is clicking through to eBay to see if there's any new bargains to be had.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Classic</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sam's Club Pokémon TCG Classic deal is back, and it's massively undercutting other big box retailers and the secondary market. Just for comparrison, the top four cards from this set, Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur and Mewtwo, are worth the same price as this discounted offer. This deal is well worth it and should be snapped up as soon as possible.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Mega Evolution Pokémon Cards Are Climbing</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"> I can't believe the X Y era of Pokémon cards came out 12 years ago, but it was an amazing era for the TCG introducing the Mega Evolution mechanic. Mega's will be returning later this year with the start of the Mega Evolutions era and the end of Scarlet and Violet, so snapping up these top Mega cards before prices go even higher is a wise move. We know how it'll play out, no one will be able to grab the new sets at launch, then the nostalgia will kick in and these cards will skyrocket.  Just the Charizards and Rayquazzas alone are worth a look.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Magic: The Gathering Price Comparison</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">MTG doesn't seem to be struggling to keep up with demand despite it being one of the biggest trading card games on earth, but that doesn't stop big box retailers getting cheeky when they notice a peak in demand. Like with Pokémon TCG, i've gone through the majority of MTG stock on Amazon and compared their pricing to market values on TCG Player. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1vxV?object_uuid=24a5da02-dcae-4d17-9365-415acfb1fd52&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Theros Beyond Death booster</a> made me spit out my tea. Amazon is listing a single booster for $378.08, but these can be picked up <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgGme?object_uuid=24a5da02-dcae-4d17-9365-415acfb1fd52&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">any day of the week for $5.59 on TCG Player</a>. Go figure. Another big difference is <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBgnNN?object_uuid=24a5da02-dcae-4d17-9365-415acfb1fd52&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marvel's Spider-Man - Play Booster Box</a>. Amazon has their preorder price guarantee on this, but it's still <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJg6mn?object_uuid=24a5da02-dcae-4d17-9365-415acfb1fd52&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">17% cheaper to preorder on TCG Player</a>. </p><p id="waoaw-sleep-mask-w-3d-eye-cups-ad"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="WAOAW Sleep Mask w/ 3D Eye Cups &amp; Ad">WAOAW Sleep Mask w/ 3D Eye Cups &amp; Adjustable Strap (Black)</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223810"><div id="223810" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>WAOAW Sleep Mask w/ 3D Eye Cups &amp; Adjustable Strap (Black)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re sensitive to light while sleeping, this 3D contoured eye mask from WAOAW might be worth trying. It’s designed with deeper eye cavities so there’s no pressure on your lids, and the wide, adjustable strap helps it stay put without pulling at your hair. The material is soft and breathable, and it comes with earplugs and a travel pouch, which makes it a handy option for travel or quick naps.</p></div><p id="the-silmarillion-deluxe-illustrated"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Silmarillion Deluxe Illustrated ">The Silmarillion Deluxe Illustrated by the Author</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223811"><div id="223811" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Silmarillion Deluxe Illustrated by the Author</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't describe how much I need this work of art. This edition of the Silmarillion arrives in a deluxe stamped clothbound hardcover edition housed in a custom slipcase and lavishly illustrated with over 50 color pieces by J.R.R. Tolkien himself. This collector's version presents the complete text in two-color print and includes exclusive extras like two fold-out maps of Beleriand, a booklet on the making of <em>The Silmarillion</em> by Christopher Tolkien, and a collectible art card. From the crafting of the Silmarils and Morgoth’s theft, to the fall of Númenor and the forging of the Rings of Power, this volume captures the vast mythological backdrop of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. Beautifully quarterbound with foil-stamped black cloth boards, silver-edged pages, and a ribbon marker, it’s a definitive edition for Tolkien devotees.</p></div><p id="tunise-rechargeable-portable-neck-fa"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tunise Rechargeable Portable Neck Fa">Tunise Rechargeable Portable Neck Fan</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223812"><div id="223812" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tunise Rechargeable Portable Neck Fan</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a fan that you don't have to hold because it sits comfortably around your neck. This is such a cool and handy product for under $15, especially if you're like me and get warm at the thought of some sunshine.</p></div><p id="3-months-free-audible"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="3 Months Free Audible">3 Months for $0.99 Audible Deal</h2></p><div catalogid="bac8eeb1-cb76-4ce5-8784-e2fb014e64c5" id="223445"><div id="223445" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>3 Months Audible Premium Plus for $0.99</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Audible’s doing that 99c a month deal again for Premium Plus, and it’s a steal. Amazon Prime Members get three months free, so make sure to check for an active subscription before looking for this deal. You get three audiobooks to keep, full access to the big library, and it works even if you’ve had a sub before as long as it’s not active now. I just logged in, saw the banner, and grabbed it. <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em> is already in my library, and I’m eyeing that massive new Sanderson one next. Less than three bucks for all that? Easy win.</p></div><p id="3-months-free-kindle-unlimited"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited">3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited</h2></p><div catalogid="bac8eeb1-cb76-4ce5-8784-e2fb014e64c5" id="223446"><div id="223446" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve never really stuck with audiobooks before, but this Kindle Unlimited deal finally got me into them properly. Right now you can get three months free if you’ve got Prime, and it works on your phone or tablet, not just a Kindle. I gave it a go, downloaded a couple of books, and now I’ve actually started finishing them while I’m out walking or doing stuff around the house. It’s made getting through my backlog way easier and I didn’t have to pay a thing to try it. If you’ve been on the fence, this is a solid excuse to dive in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
