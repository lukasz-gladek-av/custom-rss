            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-is-slashing-prices-on-ravensburger-christmas-jigsaw-puzzles-for-black-friday-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-slashing-prices-on-ravensburger-christmas-puzzles-for-black-friday.1361884/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my favorite family holiday traditions is gathering around a good jigsaw puzzle. It's one of the few activities that draws in people of all ages to work on the same activity. Every year we break out a new puzzle and just slowly work on it throughout the day together. It's relaxing, fun, and you end up with a feeling of accomplishment when you finally place that last piece. It's my turn to bring a puzzle to the family gathering this year, and luckily, Amazon is discounting a ton of puzzles from Ravensburger right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ravensburger is one of the best jigsaw puzzle brands available and one of the few I always look to buy when there's a sale. The collection of Christmas-themed puzzles I've highlighted below are especially good for the holidays, but you can check out the full sale for more options.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ravensburger Jigsaw Puzzle Sale at Amazon Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Almost all of the puzzles in this sale are considered Amazon Lightning deals. That means there is a limit to how much stock is available at the discount listed for each item. So the more popular a puzzle is, the more likely it is to have the discount fully claimed before time runs out on the sale. After covering these sales a few times, however, I've found that the "limit" on the discount is only ever reached on the most popular puzzles. And since these discounts are all part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-sale-2025-early-deals">Amazon's official Black Friday sale</a>, it's likely that the deals will last beyond the limit if people are buying enough of them.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Tips for Buying Jigsaw Puzzles</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Buying any size puzzle is a commitment. It's one that you can easily just put on a shelf and forget about, but actually starting and finishing it takes time. Unless you are a world champion puzzler, it's going to take you more than one day to put one together unless it's less than 100 pieces or you have many people helping you out.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Make sure you have enough space</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first thing you should consider before buying a puzzle is whether or not you have a place to put it together. Given that many popular puzzles are 500-1,000 pieces, it can be hard to keep track of all of them at any given time. You'll need ample space to both sort through and organize pieces and be able to leave or store it and come back to it later. If you don't already have a table that is ideal for puzzling, there are quite a few <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-tables">puzzle boards and tables</a> you can buy to remedy that. There are also jigsaw puzzle mats to roll up your puzzle and put it away without undoing all of your progress. All of these make for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-gifts">great puzzle gifts</a> and I'd highly recommend them to any puzzle fanatic.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Make sure you actually like the puzzle's image</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the more obvious tip for buying any sort of puzzle is to make sure you actually like the image you're putting together before you make a purchase. A lot of puzzles feature a ton of tiny intricate details to keep you interested as you put it together, but some feature large swaths of single colors that could get tedious to put together. If you're already investing a bunch of your time into a puzzle, pick something that you'll be happy to see when finished, even for just a moment in time.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Invest in some puzzle glue</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While most people put together puzzles just for the enjoyment of it all, it can also be fun to display the finished product once you're done. This is especially true if the puzzle is depicting a work of art, rather than just a photograph. It is, after all, a cardboard poster that you've put together yourself. If you plan on displaying your puzzle after you finish, you'll want to get yourself some puzzle glue to ensure the finished product actually stays together when you frame it.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-is-slashing-prices-on-ravensburger-christmas-jigsaw-puzzles-for-black-friday-2025]]></content:encoded>
