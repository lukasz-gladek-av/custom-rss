That means reveals for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv"><u>Diablo 4</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-ii-resurrected"><u>Diablo 2: Resurrected</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-immortal"><u>Diablo Immortal</u></a>, as all three games seek to keep players scrounging for loot in 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the presentation for its hero shooter, Blizzard has given fans a taste of what to expect. Diablo 4, which launched in June of 2023 and received its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred"><u>Vessel of Hatred</u></a> expansion in October 2024, is barreling toward the launch of its next expansion, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-expansion-lord-of-hatred-revealed-adds-not-1-but-2-new-classes-including-the-paladin-the-game-awards-2025"><u>Lord of Hatred</u></a>, this April. We already know one of its two new classes will be the Paladin, but <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24259137/tune-in-to-the-diablo-30th-anniversary-spotlight" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Blizzard says</u></a> the Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight will come with a look at the yet-to-be-revealed class, too. The World of Warcraft company also teased that fans should expect a deep dive into “major updates to skill trees” as well as its new endgame systems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Diablo 2: Resurrected is an unexpected but welcome addition to the Spotlight. Blizzard has been coy when it comes to what it will show for its Diablo 2 remake, only <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24246296/diablo-ii-resurrected-ladder-season-13-coming-soon" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teasing</u></a> that “there’s a lot we want to share with you,” as it prepares for the launch of Ladder Season 13 February 20. Some are hoping for quality-of-life changes while others speculate about a potential Steam release, but with the 2021 remake largely remaining faithful to the original 2000 experience, it’s hard to say what its future holds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, there’s Diablo Immortal, Blizzard’s 2022 mobile spinoff. A closer look at the 2026 roadmap is locked in, as the company has told players its ongoing story will carry them “deeper into a world shaped by corruption, conflict, and consequences.” Its <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24250353/witness-the-diablo-30th-anniversary-spotlight" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> on the matter promises more information about a new class, a new region, and “the return of a malevolent force.”</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight premieres tomorrow, February 11, at 2pm PT/5pm ET, and can be streamed on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/diablo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnAsWN-6hvw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>.
