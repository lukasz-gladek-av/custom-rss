            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“Why would you guys bring that up?"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Cast your mind back to 2023. At the time, MCU fans didn’t know who exactly would go on to play The Sentry in Thunderbolts*, but the rumor mill pointed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/invincible">Invincible</a> star Steven Yeun. So when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-walking-dead-star-steven-yeuns-top-secret-mcu-role-revealed">Invincible creator Robert Kirkman let slip that Yeun would be playing Robert Reynolds</a>, aka The Sentry, in Thunderbolts*, Marvel fans went wild.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s that original quote from Kirkman two years ago:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, he [Yeun] called me, he went in for a costume fitting. I hope I’m not... I don’t think this is a spoiler or anything that will get anybody in trouble. I don’t know, maybe. We’ll see. I don’t care. I don’t work for Marvel. What are they going to do to me?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, he called me and he said, 'I just came back from a costume fitting for The Sentry. I guess I only do superheroes that are yellow and blue.' He said he was at the costume fitting and was like, 'Aww, crap. I forgot Invincible was yellow and blue.'"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward two years, with Thunderbolts* out the door, and we know The Sentry eventually went to Lewis Pullman after Yeun himself dropped out. But at the time, Yeun as The Sentry felt like a sure thing. After all, Kirkman had confirmed it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, it seemed, caused Kirkman all sorts of trouble. In an interview with IGN at San Diego Comic-Con 2025 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robert-kirkman-teases-massive-roster-of-playable-characters-for-invincible-vs-thats-a-spoiler-i-might-get-in-trouble-for-that-sdcc-2025">to promote fighting game Invincible VS</a>, we asked Kirkman <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aang-avatar-movie-adds-invincibles-steven-yeun-to-its-cast">who Yeun will play in the upcoming animated The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender movie</a>, given how much he seemingly knows about the actor's schedule.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don't want to lose any more sleep spoiling Steven Yeun news!” Kirkman said. “I cannot tell you how much that Thunderbolts thing affected me.” Then, Kirkman joked: “Why would you guys bring that up? I'm so angry.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Avatar: The Last Airbender Episodes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirkman wenton to reveal that he actually <em>does</em> know who Yeun plays in The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender, but this time stopped short of spilling the beans - perhaps with his Thunderbolts / Marvel run-in in mind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The best part is he told me who he's playing in The Last Airbender and I was like, ‘I wish I didn't know. I wish I didn't know.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirkman continued the joke, saying Steven Yeun is set to play Abraham Lincoln in the unconfirmed hit TV show based on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skinbreaker-skybound-exclusive-preview-robert-kirkman-david-finch">Skinbreaker</a>, his new comic book series he’s working on with artist David Finch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At Comic-Con this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-season-4s-dinosaurus-has-a-voice-actor-robert-kirkman-says-7-9-seasons-needed-to-do-the-complete-comic-arc-jokes-season-5-will-be-out-in-2032-sdcc-2025">Kirkman announced Invincible Season 4's Dinosaurus voice actor</a>, revealed how many seasons the show will need to complete the story of the comics, and joked Season 5 will be out in 2032.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Michael Buckner/Variety via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Imagining what you will play, finally getting those couple of games to the table to try, or being surprised by what new thing your friend got is all just part of the charm of these events. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some games, however, are events unto themselves – games that take most, if not a whole, day (or more) to play. That's where the games on this list fall. Titles that may require a weekend getaway with your close friends to one of those nice cabins in the woods, or on one of those giant tables you can find at a game convention. It may take a while to plan, but playing these games will still provide you with memories that can last a lifetime.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in This Article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're too busy playing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board games</a> to read blurbs, you can see all the games on the list in the catalog above. But if you want to dig deeper into what each of the games is, keep on scrolling and reading.</p><p id="axis-allies-1940"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Axis &amp; Allies: 1940"><strong>Axis &amp; Allies: 1940 Global (A&amp;A 1940 Europe + 1940 Pacific)</strong></h2></p><div id="225829" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Axis &amp; Allies: 1940 Europe Second Edition</h3></p></div><div catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0" id="225830"><div id="225830" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Axis &amp; Allies: 1940 Pacific Second Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Axis &amp; Allies series of wargames has been around for over 40 years at this point, letting fans of World War 2 fight one another to their heart's content. Composed of two separate games – Axis &amp; Allies 1940 Europe and 1940 Pacific – Axis &amp; Allies: 1940 Global is by far the largest of the franchise, with a combined board that dwarfs the already impressive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/axis-allies-40th-anniversary-edition-board-game-review"><u>Axis &amp; Allies 1940 Anniversary Edition</u></a> and requires a large table to play on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with its large footprint, this game still accommodates between <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two players</a> and six players, with one team assuming the roles of the Allied Powers and the other the Axis, as they take turns buying units, moving them around, and rolling dice to wage war. Even with experienced players, this is a game you should plan a weekend to play, when factoring in short breaks for things like food or sleep. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These versions of Axis &amp; Allies add in new types of ground and air units, different types of factories, and other adjustments that make Europe, Pacific, and Global arguably the most intricate of entries of the main series, and may not be the best option for folks new to the games. But, if you do plan to play this option a lot, it may be worthwhile to invest in the <a href="https://zdcs.link/akK0X5?object_uuid=0c69ce94-1081-4ba2-9419-d8d18336260e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">neoprene map</a> Renegade offers, which is the global map and is scaled up slightly to make it easier to fit all your units on spaces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To get a better idea of just how long this game can take, the world tournament that's held at <a href="https://www.gencon.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gen Con</a> has a rule that limits the game time to nine hours. A nine-hour match for folks who are considered experts in the game, and even then, sometimes it isn’t long enough!</p></div><p id="twilight-imperium-4th-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Twilight Imperium: 4th Edition"><strong>Twilight Imperium 4th Edition + Prophecy of Kings Expansion</strong></h2></p><div id="225831" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Twilight Imperium: 4th Edition</h3></p></div><div catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0" id="225832"><div id="225832" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Twilight Imperium 4th Edition - Prophecy of Kings Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Out of all the games on this list, Twilight Imperium is probably the one whose legend is most known for how long it takes to play, and the most current iteration, 4th Edition (especially when paired with its Prophecy of Kings expansion) continues that Legacy. Twilight Imperium is a massive space 4x game (eXpand, eXploit, eXpore, eXterminate) where players not only have to navigate the hazards of space, but also of one another. It's a game I'm quite fond of, ranking it among one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games"><u>best wargames</u></a> on the market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While at first glance TI may appear to look like just another wargame set in space, you spend more of your time negotiating and making deals than shooting out missiles if you want to succeed. While it’s almost a running joke that anyone who owns this game never actually plays it, if you should find yourself so lucky to play it or have the tablespace for it, there are few games out there that can offer such a memorable experience. If you start a game in the morning, you should be able to complete a game in a single day, even though you may be a little late getting home.</p></div><p id="mega-empires"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Empires">Mega Empires <strong> (The East + The West)</strong></h2></p><div id="225833" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Empires: The East</h3></p></div><div catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0" id="225834"><div id="225834" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Empires: The West</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like Axis &amp; Allies: 1940 Global, Mega Empires is also the amalgamation of two large games, merged into an even larger monolith that can accommodate 18 – yes, you read that right – players. Despite its size, the actual flow and play of game isn’t all that complicated, with players taking control over advancing a specific ancient civilization, spreading out their troops, building cities, and trading resources with one another in an effort to create large pairs of the same type of resource, with more matching cards earning more victory points. There isn’t much in the way of war in this game, as it's much more focused on trading and negotiating trades with your neighbors to get cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big twist, however, is that in addition to having to trade at least three cards, you only have to tell the truth about two of them, which can be dangerous as the person who is promising you one thing, could be in fact, handing over one calamity card, too. These make for all sorts of trouble, but they also keep things exciting and tense. This game you should probably factor in a weekend to play comfortably, though it does have rules specifically for when players have to leave the game partway through. That should tell you just how long a game can last.</p></div><p id="war-of-the-ring-2nd-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="War of The Ring 2nd Edition">War of The Ring: 2nd Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0" id="225835"><div id="225835" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>War of The Ring 2nd Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Often described as “Lord of the Rings in a box,” War of the Ring by ARES Games puts players in the role of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth and the other as the Shadow as they rewrite the epic confrontations from Tolkien’s masterpiece. How would things play out if Boromir didn’t fall in battle, or the Strider split off early from the group to rally the people to war? Do you think you could have won the war for the Dark Lord where Saruman failed? Well, it’s time to put your gold where your dragon is and prove it! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For experienced players, this is a game that won’t take all day, and can be played in a few hours, but you will still feel exhausted and worn out from just how tense this game can get. And for newer players, you can expect a good six-plus hours of gameplay ahead. Between its strategic army play, action cards that can turn the tides of an encounter, and the slow-but-steady progression of the Fellowship towards delivering the One Ring to Mt. Doom, this game is a must-own for fans of Lord of the Rings. Here at IGN, we think its one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time"><u>best board games that you should play this year</u></a>.</p></div><p id="diplomacy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Diplomacy">Diplomacy</h2></p><div catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0" id="225836"><div id="225836" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Diplomacy</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in 20th-century Europe prior to the outbreak of World War I, Diplomacy places up to seven players in the roles of the heads of Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey as they strive to gain territory. This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games"><u>classic board game</u></a> is far less about rolling the dice and waging war, but is more about making backroom deals with other players and backstabbing each other for your benefit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each turn begins with a 15-minute phase where players can go and negotiate their deals and decide on their plans, before returning to the board and writing their orders out – yes, you physically write out your orders – for their armies and naval fleets. No dice rolling is involved. Your goal is to be the first person to control 18 of the various Supply Centers around the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Diplomacy is jokingly referred to as “the friend killer” as this game can be nasty, and lead to tempers rising, but that is also part of the fun.

            <title><![CDATA[Wildgate Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/wildgate-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wildgate-review-in-progress.1253721/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It only took one match of Wildgate to see the potential in its spacefaring PvPvE mayhem. Now, after just over 20 hours of playtime, I’m also noticing where there is still room for it to build on that compelling concept. The intensely cooperative chaos of managing a spacecraft, delving into PvE dungeons for loot, and fending off rival crews makes for complex and exciting contests of teamwork and communication. Unfortunately, that level of coordination doesn’t always lead to great outcomes when matchmaking with random crewmates, where silent players or, worse yet, insanely toxic personalities can make for a bad time. But when a matchmade crew manages to come together, or you bring your own friends to the party, Wildgate’s simple but solid gunplay and multifaceted ship-to-ship combat give <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-review-2020"><u>Sea of Thieves</u></a> a run for its money. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wildgate is a unique multiplayer sci-fi shooter that sends five teams of four players out into the most dangerous section of the galaxy, called the Reach, to battle it out for loot and glory. Their ultimate goal is to find the all-important Artifact hidden somewhere in space and escape with it out of the Wildgate, but since there’s the little issue of only being one to go around, a clash of crews in tumultuous FPS combat is all but inevitable. To improve your chances of survival (and search for the Artifact along the way), you’ll want to hurriedly touch down to enter as many of the small PvE dungeons as possible, killing enemies and solving simple puzzles to claim whatever loot they’re hiding. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Upgrading your spacecraft with better shields, weapons, defensive measures, and stat improvements (like improved turning speed) can make all the difference when an enemy vessel nears and all hell breaks loose, which make for Wildgate’s tensest moments. If you’re able to find and escape with the Artifact, or simply murder all the enemy crews before they’re able to extract it themselves, then victory is yours, and in matches that can run over 40 minutes each, the taste of triumph is one of the sweetest there is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no story to be found in Wildgate, or at least not one outside of little snippets you can read from a menu between matches, but the world definitely has a distinct and endearing personality to it. That could be in the baddies you run into like raiders and alien life forms who look like booger people, or the playable characters, called Prospectors, who span from a big dog-looking alien to an aquatic creature in a mecha fishbowl. Each Prospector has their own interesting set of traits and abilities they can use to contribute to the team’s success (or demise). Ion, the four-armed alien can use his brawn to damage the hulls of ships just by smacking them with his fists, while Venture the robot serves as a great starter character since they don’t require oxygen to survive, regenerate health faster, and get warned when enemies are behind them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve had a lot of fun trying each one out to see which suits my playstyle, with my favorite being Mophs the winged, bird-like humanoid that can turn invisible, which is absolutely invaluable when boarding enemy ships to perform subterfuge. But as is the case with lots of stuff in Wildgate, the biggest issue is simply a scarcity of options, because it doesn’t take long at all to unlock and try each of them out. Seeing the same handful of familiar characters aboard each ship just feels a bit underwhelming in an endless galaxy of possibilities.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It could have some real legs with updates, but I already feel like I’ve seen just about everything right now.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Though matches have been a lot of fun to play repeatedly the past few days, with only one game mode, seven characters, four models of starship, and a handful of weapons to use, it all feels a tad thin at the moment. If developer Moonshot Games comes out the (wild)gate swinging with regular updates that introduce new weapons, enemies, characters, and ships in the fashion of something like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a>, then I can definitely see Wildgate having some real legs. But, at the moment, it feels like just a taste of what will hopefully be a game with a lot more variety down the road, and I already feel like I’ve seen just about everything that can happen across the matches I’ve played so far. There’s still a ton of fun to be found in getting better at winning, and knowing what I know now about the types of dungeons to be found and loot to be claimed has made me a lot more strategic with how I play, but I stopped being surprised by things I saw out in the Reach pretty quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve got plenty more of Wildgate to play before my final review – I didn’t even talk about ship-to-ship combat yet, for example, since I’m still in the process of trying all of the different vessels out – but so far it’s been a lot of fun to play with friends marred by much less fun matches when on matchmade teams (the amount of slurs I heard shouted over the proximity voice chat on day one was frankly startling). I’m hopeful the Moonshot will be quick to add new content, because there’s the makings of a great live-service game here, and I’m eager to dive back in.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite 4-Player FPS Games</h3></p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/wildgate-review]]></content:encoded>

Although no specific plot details are ready to be shared, the team behind the Wolfenstein series shared an official logline that makes things nice and simple: “The story of killing Nazis is evergreen.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The foundation for a TV series adaptation based on the classic alternate history video game franchise is about as solid as any fan could hope for. The Leftovers writer and Station Eleven creator Patrick Somerville is currently attached as creator, writer, executive producer, and showrunner for the Wolfenstein show via his chaoticgood.tv banner. Variety adds that Somerville has been a fan of Wolfenstein “since he was a child.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Amazon is re-teaming with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series"><u>Fallout series</u></a> production company Kilter Films for the new project, with Jonathan Nolan, Lisa Joy, and Athena Wickham all on board as executive producers. Keyframe Films’ James Altman, as well as MachineGames’ Jerk Gustafsson, have also joined as executive producers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Wolfenstein works to bring its first-person shooter story to television screens, it’s clear Bethesda and Amazon are more than happy to continue working together. Fallout premiered to acclaim from fans and critics alike when its first season made its debut on Prime Video last year (we gave it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-1-review-amazon-prime-video"><u>a 9/10</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Work on Fallout Season 2 is well underway, too, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-has-wrapped-production-walton-goggins-sheds-his-ghoul-skin-in-delight"><u>production wrapped all the way back in May</u></a>. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-teaser-hits-the-internet-reveals-fresh-look-at-new-vegas"><u>teaser featuring fan-favorite location New Vegas</u></a> then arrived just days later, with the new season <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-premieres-december-2025-renewed-for-season-3"><u>set to arrive this December, and Season 3 also confirmed</u></a> to be on the way.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Dystopian TV Shows of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wolfenstein video game series, meanwhile, traces all the way back to the ‘80s with Castle Wolfenstein, but it wasn’t until 1992’s Wolfenstein 3D that the Nazi-killing video game really came into its own. Numerous entries have arrived in the years since, with its most recent storyline, beginning with Wolfenstein: The New Order in 2014, following the nigh-unkillable William B.J. Blazkowicz. Although it received a sequel, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus, in 2017, and two standalone spinoffs in 2019, the series has gone without a mainline entry for a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Amazon, Kilter, Bethesda, and the rest of the team keep their heads down to focus on the Wolfenstein series, you can read about some of the other video game adaptations Amazon has in the works. These include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-has-a-new-showrunner-battlestar-galactica-and-deep-space-nines-ronald-d-moore-takes-the-reins"><u>a show based on God of War</u></a>, as well as other projects that take place in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-is-now-officially-in-development-at-amazon"><u>Mass Effect</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-amazon-studios-henry-cavill"><u>Warhammer 40,000</u></a> universes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
