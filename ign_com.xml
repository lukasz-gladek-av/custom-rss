            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"...but I can say that we are being extremely aggressive."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> are encouraging players on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S to keep crossplay on, even if they “can’t promise that there will be zero cheaters” on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ripple Effect technical director Christian Buhl and senior console combat designer Matthew Nickerson talked about the ever-present threat of cheaters in Battlefield during a recent interview with IGN. During our chat, we learned about how the team is supporting console players with everything from crossplay to performance and fidelity modes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We also learned about how the studio has implemented anti-cheat measures for next month’s Battlefield sequel. The conversation saw Buhl acknowledge that, while it will be hard to guarantee a cheat-free environment for those playing with the Battlefield 6 PC pool, Ripple Effect and the rest of the BF Studios team have gone to great lengths to fight off cheaters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, we're doing a lot on the PC side to clamp down on cheating as much as possible,” Buhl said. “We have a whole team within Battlefield dedicated to anti-cheat, which includes engineers, analysts who are reviewing things and banning players, and figuring out what the latest cheats are. We have another whole dedicated team at EA to anti-cheat that we work closely with.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buhl also highlights the new Battlefield 6 anti-cheat system, Javelin, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-really-sucks-battlefield-6-developer-dice-knows-anti-cheat-measures-like-secure-boot-mean-some-pc-gamers-just-wont-be-able-to-play-the-game"><u>the divisive secure boot</u></a>, as other important components in their strategy. Still, as cheaters continue to run amok across the most popular multiplayer games on the market, Ripple Effect knows some will slip through the cracks, especially on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now, we can never win against cheaters, right?” Buhl added. “Cheaters will always be there. It's a never-ending cat-and-mouse game. I can't promise that there will be zero cheaters if you're playing against PC players. That's just simply not possible, but I can say that we are being extremely aggressive. We see this as critical to the success of — to the health of — the game.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6 - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 has a release date of October 10, 2025, for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S, but cheaters were able to infiltrate servers months early. EA held open beta periods throughout August, allowing players to get a pre-release taste of the Battlefield experience BF Studios has been cooking up for the last few years. It also saw players come <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cheaters-already-spotted-in-battlefield-6-open-beta-despite-secure-boot-requirement"><u>face-to-face with cheaters</u></a> despite the development team’s efforts, with EA reporting it prevented 330,000 cheat attempts by August 8, just one day after open beta early access began.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nickerson said crossplay will be on by default when a player loads into Battlefield 6 for the first time, something players should know if they’re especially worried about encountering cheaters on PC. Console users who turn off crossplay will limit their pools to the PlayStation and Xbox communities, but Ripple Effect is hoping it won’t come to that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You don't want to play a game and feel like a bunch of people on the other side are cheating,” Buhl added. “I hope console players feel confident enough in what we're doing for cheating on the PC side that they don't feel like they want to turn crossplay off just for that reason. If they do want to, that is an available option for them, but we think it's super important for PC and console players to be confident that most of the people that they're playing with or against are not cheating, and we're putting a huge amount of effort into that.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see Buhl and Nickerson explain some of the other ways BF Studios is prepping for the launch of Battlefield 6 in our full interview. You can also read up on what the rest of the Battlefield team learned from the beta and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-dev-dice-confirms-big-changes-coming-to-player-movement-especially-horizontal-speed"><u>what kind of fixes players can expect to see at launch</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

Movie titled The Super Mario Galaxy Movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s confirmation that arrives after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-movie-sequel-domain-names-spotted-ahead-of-nintendo-direct">rumors swept the internet</a> yesterday, revealing that Nintendo will indeed be partnering up with the Minions movie studio yet again to create a movie adaptation of the classic 2007 Wii platformer. It’s slated to arrive in the U.S. April 3, 2026, and in Japan April 24, 2026, with its first trailer revealing a small amount of footage before showing off its official title and logo.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's announcement also revealed some of The Super Mario Galaxy Movie's cast. It's a lineup that focuses on returning names that shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, with Chris Pratt back as Mario, Anya Taylor-Joy back as Princess Peach, Charlie Day back as Luigi, Jack Black back as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key back as Toad, and Kevin Michael Richardson back as Kamek.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie has a lot of potential for newcomers to the cast, too. Who will play Rosalina is likely the question on the minds of most fans, as the storytelling icon first made her debut in the original 2007 game but didn't show up for The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The last film also teased a potential appearance from Yoshi, though it's unclear if Mario's dinosaur companion will have any speaking lines when or if he eventually appears.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Teaser Trailer - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is out in just about seven months.

Additions to both games for these new versions include boosted resolution (up to 4K on Switch 2), an improved UI, a new in-game music player, and the option to play using button and stick or motion controls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most intriguingly, these fresh additions will include additional pages of Rosalina's in-game storybook — which contains some very interesting lore for the character.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto announced the two games' return today during the company's major Nintendo Direct, which also offered a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-coming-april-2026-with-first-teaser-trailer">first look at The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, the upcoming sequel to the smash-hit Super Mario Movie that's due to launch next spring. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could these new Super Mario Galaxy story pages tie into The Super Mario Galaxy Movie's plot, somehow? For now, Nintendo is keeping story details of the film under wraps, but we wouldn't be surprised.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who've yet to play the Galaxy games, their execellent gravity-defying gameplay remains the pinnacle of the 3D Mario franchise for many. The titles also included — rarely, for Nintendo — something of a story, detailing space princess Rosalina's past.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Accompanying the release will be a pair of new Super Mario Galaxy amiibo, which will offer additional in-game items. Mario &amp; Luma can be scanned in either game to receive a Life Mushroom, while Rosalina &amp; Lumas will give you a 1-Up Mushroom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first statuette features Mario being flung through a Warp Star, as a Luma chases behind. The second features Rosalina, reading from her storybook and surrounded by two Lumas. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These amiibo will arrive a little later, on April 2, 2026 — around the time we're expecting The Super Mario Galaxy Movie to arrive in theaters. A hardcover book version of Rosalina's storybook will also be available, though it will not contain the new story content added in the games' Switch versions.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/12/mario-galaxy-amiibo-1-1757683837862.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Other announcements including sponsorship of the Kyoto Marathon 2026 and a fresh design for the Nintendo Museum ticket.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today has been absolutely stuffed full of Nintendo news, including major announcements regarding Zelda, Pokémon and Fire Emblem.
