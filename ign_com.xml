            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Company moves to "globally consistent, enterprise-wide work model."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Electronic Arts has announced to employees that it will be ending its remote working policies permanently, and implementing a full return to office.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an email sent to employees today viewed by IGN, CEO Andrew Wilson said that in-person work results in "a kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players." He then went on to broadly outline that "hybrid work" would now be defined as a "minimum of three days a week in your local office," and that "offsite local roles" would be gradually phased out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a follow-up email from EA Entertainment president, Laura Miele, also viewed by IGN, she clarified further details, describing the company as moving from "a decentralized approach to a globally consistent, enterprise-wide work model":</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>These changes will not take effect immediately. Employees should continue working as directed by your Business Unit until further notice, regardless of where you live.</em></li><li><em>Work model transitions will come with a minimum 12-week notice period before any changes are implemented. The timing will vary by location and will be communicated locally with plenty of notice.</em></li><li><em>Hybrid work will mean working from your local office at least three days per week–this aligns with what’s outlined in Andrew’s EA Action. </em></li><li><em>We are introducing a new 30-mile/48-km radius around EA locations.</em></li><li><em>What this means:</em><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>Employees who live within 30-miles/48-km of an EA location will transition to a Hybrid work model. </em></li><li><em>Employees who live outside the 30-mile/48-km radius will be considered remote unless their role is designated as On Site or Hybrid.</em></li></ul></li><li><em>We will also sunset the Offsite Local work model. Depending on your location, this transition may take 3 to 24 months.</em></li><li><em>Any work model exception and future Remote hires will require a CEO Direct’s /my approval. </em></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Several sources within EA speaking to IGN anonymously said that employees were upset and confused, with some employees sharing hours-long commutes they were now being expected to make, or expressing concerns regarding childcare or personal medical conditions that had benefited from remote work. Others, classified as remote and outside the 30-mile range, expressed concern for what would happen to their roles if they were unwilling or unable to move closer to an office long-term. Two sources explained to IGN that per the breakdown sent by Miele, existing remote workers would have their "exemptions" to return to office "sunset" sometime in the next 3 to 24 months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While remote work has long been prevalent in the video game industry, it became exceptionally popular during and after the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, when stay-at-home mandates forced most AAA companies to adapt remote work as a long-term solution. In the years since, more and more companies have hired more and more remote workers, and existing near-office workers have reported moving to cheaper cities away from offices, under the impression that remote work was permanent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, other major video game companies have recently been calling workers back to office, resulting in frustration and, at times, employee turnover as workers were forced to choose between expensive or challenging relocation and their jobs. Companies such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-games-is-asking-employees-to-return-to-office-amid-gta-security-concerns">Rockstar Games</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-montreal-in-turmoil-amid-what-developers-are-calling-broken-promises">Ubisoft</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-qa-workers-protest-new-office-mandate-calling-it-a-soft-layoff">Activision</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-producer-claims-studio-is-creating-crisis-maps-as-more-employees-depart">Blizzard</a> have all faced criticism from within and without as a result of these policies. However, the return to office mandates have appeared to move apace, with more companies such as EA opting to require an in-office model once again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn">laid off around 300 individuals company-wide</a>, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">earlier layoffs at BioWare this year</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">termination of around 670 roles last year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has reached out to EA for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
