            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-dlc-overture-director-vows-to-review-various-adjustments-including-difficulty-reduction<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Among all the feedback, we are paying the closest attention to the combat experience."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lies-of-p"><u>Lies of P</u></a> developer Neowiz did indeed drop <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lies-of-p-overture"><u>DLC Overture</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-overture-trailer-leaks-online-teases-imminent-shadow-drop"><u>during Summer Game Fest</u></a>, introducing new locations, new enemies and bosses, new characters, weapons, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-director-explains-u-turn-on-difficulty-we-wanted-to-make-sure-a-wider-audience-could-play-the-game"><u>the very controversial decision to add in two easier difficulty options</u></a>. And now, those options are getting easier again as the team preps for "difficulty reduction."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a "Soulslike" game, Lies of P can be punishingly difficult, especially for inexperienced players perhaps attracted by Lies of P's dark story and setting. Director Jiwon Choi had previously said the team <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiesOfP/comments/1kscdcj/why_did_he_change_his_mind/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>didn't think Soulslike games should have difficulty options</u></a> and it shipped without any, but has since had a change of heart, saying: “We wanted to make sure a wider audience of players could play the game."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For those attempting the Overture DLC on the "intended" difficulty, Legendary Stalker, however, things seem tougher than ever. There have been so many comments — both for and against the DLC's difficulty spike — that the Lies of P subreddit has had to merge them all into a "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiesOfP/comments/1l7c6ao/all_difficulty_posts_are_being_moved_to_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>megathread</u></a>" to stop the community from being overwhelmed by complaints.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some comments and reviews on Steam echo this, with one <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199023944775/recommended/2848330/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>writing</u></a>: "I’m at level 300 and should not be getting 2-shot from basic enemies. It doesn’t help that the enemy grouping is designed for you to have to deal with multiple at once. This wouldn’t be a problem if even one of those enemies doesn’t take out half your health with one hit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, courtesy of a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BY3Zw_nOCI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Lies of P Director's Letter</u></a>, it seems the difficulty will be tweaked once again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're reviewing all of [the player feedback] carefully and are already looking into when to implement some of your suggestions," Choi said, as spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-overture-will-have-difficulty-reduced-in-future-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Eurogamer</u></a>. "Among all the feedback, we are paying the closest attention to the combat experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We identified areas that did not turn out quite as we intended. Therefore, we are reviewing various adjustments, including difficulty reduction. However, combat is one of the most fundamental experiences in Lies of P, so any modifications or changes require meticulous work and thorough testing." It's perhaps because of that "fundamental" issue that Neowiz has not given an indication of when the game will be patched.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We had a good time with Lies of P, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-review"><u>awarding it 8/10</u></a>, and Overture itself also secured a 8/10. "Even if it’s clearly dancing on the same old strings, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-overture-review"><u>Lies of P: Overture</u></a> is an excellent expansion that adds a whole lot more to a game that was already great," we wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hides-mirror-mode-free-roam-behind-a-mario-64-easter-egg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> fans have discovered a way to zoom around the game's open world in Mirror Mode — and the way to access it is a cool throwback to a classic Nintendo platformer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember warping through the paintings in Princess Peach's Castle, back in Super Mario 64? Well, you can use a similar method to access Mario Kart World's Mirror Mode in Free Roam, if you drive over and scale the same royal residence's roof.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fair warning, you'll need to have unlocked Mario Kart World's main Mirror Mode before this secret is possible. IGN has tested this method without Mirror Mode unlocked, and it doesn't work until you have that sorted first.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, if you've not done it already, you'll need the Mirror Mode option unlocked for Grand Prix and Knockout Tour by completing all cups on 150cc and finishing a handful of P-Switches, Peach Medallions and Question Panels in Free Roam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Mirror Mode unlocked, you can then set about finding the secret to explore Free Roam in Mirror Mode, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Load up the game's central Princess Stadium course in Free Roam (remember you can fast travel there from the world map using Y) and leap off the road as you spiral upwards with the castle on your right. Aim to land on the large red roof below you, then drive over to the castle's main turret. In front of you lies its large stained glass window featuring Peach and... you know what to do next. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/10/20250610104659-01jxckfp71ygw0q2jq255g6hbj-1749548893351.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Captain Toad readies himself to make the jump into Mirror Mode.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Driving through the window causes a Mario 64 painting-style ripple, and warps you through to a mirrored version of Mario Kart World's, er, world. Ta-da! Even your world map is flipped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see this all for yourself in the video embedded below:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Some nice Mirror Mode Easter egg haha <a href="https://t.co/7q5GIqZ91l" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/7q5GIqZ91l</a></p>— Ninjinaut (@Ninjinaut) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ninjinaut/status/1931248124208496810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Nintendo fans completing Mario Kart World discovered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-spot-shigeru-miyamoto-missing-from-mario-kart-world-credits-but-it-isnt-too-much-of-a-surprise">Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto was missing from the game's credits</a>, but his absence probably shouldn't come as too much of a surprise.

But when asked, the CEO of Hitman developer IO Interactive, which is publishing the game, said that he doesn't believe that's happening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This saga began as part of the lead-up to the release of MindsEye on June 10, which has garnered no small amount of negative feedback from those who have been following it pre-release. During a Q&amp;A over the game's official Discord two weeks ago, developer Build a Rocket Boy co-CEO Mark Gerhard was asked: “Do you think that all the people who reacted negatively were financed by someone?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“100%,” Gerhard responded, before adding: “Doesn't take much to guess who 🤣”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The conversation continued, with many expressing surprise at this response and one person saying: "A co-CEO for a studio implying another studio is paying previewers to talk negatively about your game is an absolutely wild comment to make in a public environment in any situation.” Gerhard replied: "Not wild when its [sic] true....."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this accusation hanging in the air, I spoke to IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak this past weekend in the wake of the company's showcase featuring <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>, Hitman, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a>, which IOI is publishing. Two weeks ago, IOI declined to respond to a request for comment on the situation. But during that interview, I asked Abrak outright if he thought the accusation was true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He responded: "I don't know. I don't believe that. I don't believe that. I just think the game should speak for itself on June the 10th."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Abrak did not say more on the subject, though he did respond briefly to the increasing negative comments about MindsEye <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-calls-on-fans-to-wait-for-official-launch-after-street-date-breaks-a-week-early-confirms-major-day-one-update-for-physical-copies">now that it has broken its street date</a>. "I think we should all wait 'til the 10th of June because it's very normal these times that we all as developers keep on working on patches and working to the last minute. And there's a lot of these things coming in. So I think that people should just wait until the release and have the best possible experience."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MindsEye Screenshots May 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We recently had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-director-on-the-importance-of-allowing-user-generated-content-in-the-game-ign-live-2025">game director Leslie Benzies on IGN Live</a> to talk about MindsEye, specifically about plans for user-generated content in-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll be publishing our full interview with Abrak later this week, including discussion of not just MindsEye, but also the future of the Hitman franchise and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-isnt-part-of-the-james-bond-film-canon">007: First Light</a>.
