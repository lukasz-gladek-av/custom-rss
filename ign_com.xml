            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-handheld-what-i-want-to-see-from-microsofts-portable-console<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-plans-to-release-an-xbox-handheld-but-its-years-away">Xbox boss Phil Spencer once again mentioned that an Xbox handheld</a> is potentially in the works, but that it is still a few years out. While that timeline sucks, it does mean Microsoft has time to really make it into something awesome that can compete with top-end <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-handheld-gaming-pc">handheld gaming PCs</a> like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/asus-rog-ally-x-review">Asus ROG Ally X</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What we do know is that Phil Spencer has gone on record saying he “think(s) being able to play games locally is really important”, which suggests that any Xbox handheld that comes out won’t follow the same playbook as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-portal-review">PlayStation Portal</a>, which could only play games streamed from your PS5. Unfortunately, that’s about all we really know about what the handheld console would actually be, but that doesn’t mean I can’t sit here and dream about what I’d like to see out of a potential Xbox handheld, even if I do have to wait a couple years to get my hands on it. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Run Windows, But Make it Controller-Friendly</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s face it, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-xbox-console-release-dates-in-order">Xbox consoles</a> become more like Windows 11 every single day – hell, there’s even ads on the home screen now – so why not go all the way and make the presumptive Xbox handheld run Windows 11. This would open up the platform to hundreds of games that the Xbox Series X simply can’t run, plus, it would allow (or force) Microsoft to create a version of Windows 11 that’s navigable with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-series-controller">controller</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has certainly created weird one-off UIs for Windows before. After all, this is the same company that created Windows RT, plus versions of Windows 7 and 8 that ran on Windows phones – remember those? It could be argued that all of those disparate versions of Windows were complete disasters, but as long as it’s optional, it could be a great way for Microsoft to get more Windows users, while also letting people that don’t like navigating a traditional desktop ignore the more arcane elements of Windows 11. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/19/gs1ioj2wcaax-he-1721386723939.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Make the Gamepad-Friendly Windows UI Downloadable on Any System</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If Microsoft makes its Xbox handheld a Windows device with a gamepad-friendly UI – and that’s a big if – it would be super cool if it would also make it available for anyone to implement on their <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-pc">gaming PCs</a>. I personally have a gaming PC set up in my living room, and I have to have a keyboard and mouse nearby to use it, especially when I’m trying to play a game that’s not on Steam. A controller-friendly Windows UI would do wonders there. It would also make using handheld gaming PCs much easier, now that more of them come running Windows 11. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Manufacturers like Asus and Lenovo have created ways to navigate the operating system with the controllers, but they’re not <em>awesome.</em> Essentially, both of them have ways to emulate mouse input when you’re interacting with the desktop. This works most of the time, but there have definitely been times where it’s stopped working for one reason or another and I’ve had to fumble around with a touchscreen, and Windows 11 is notoriously awful for touch displays. I’m no engineer, so I don’t know how hard it’d be to implement, but I’d love to have a toggle somewhere in Windows 11 settings to enable a ‘controller mode.’ </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/24/gettyimages-1233352115-1700844269665.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Don’t Lock It Down to the Windows Store or Xbox Store</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The main reason an Xbox handheld running on Windows 11 instead of a standalone operating system would be appealing is because it’d let you run whatever you wanted, rather than just what’s on the Xbox Store. Letting people play any game they own on Steam, Epic, or one of the countless PC gaming platforms would be incredible. I don’t know about you, but these days, I just want to play my game on whatever device I’m using at any given moment, and the more open the Xbox handheld’s OS is, the more it’ll let me do that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has already indulged my need to play games on a billion little devices with its <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/xbox-play-anywhere" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Play Anywhere</a> program that essentially lets you buy a game on PC and then play it on Xbox Series X, with your saves carrying over. The problem is that it only supports certain first-party games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if Microsoft has it locked to the Xbox store by default, at least give us access to the BIOS so we can install an unlocked version of Windows ourselves. It took Microsoft a few years to learn that lesson with Windows 10S and RT, let’s hope that it applies those lessons to the Xbox handheld, too. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/11/16/xbox-series-1605567051768.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Quick Resume</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The one thing that keeps me playing games on the Xbox Series X instead of my gaming PC is Quick Resume. There’s something to be said about having multiple games that are essentially suspended, that you can swap between at will. This is awesome when you’re stuck on a boss and you want to take a break with a different game, then come back with a clear head without losing any progress. I want that on Windows, especially for a handheld system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the time, when you put a gaming PC in sleep mode while it’s running a game, that game will still be running when you wake it up. This is essentially what happens when you tap the power button on your ROG Ally. However, it’s not perfect, and there are times where things will break in your game when you wake your system from sleep. So, the capability is technically there for something like Quick Resume, it would just need to be implemented. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/19/rog-ally-x-6-1721422488016.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Wait for More Powerful Hardware</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While the AMD Z1 Extreme is awesome for handheld gaming PCs, we’re still waiting for AMD to create a next-generation version of it. What makes the Z1 special is that it’s specially engineered for the needs of a handheld gaming system. It has awesome graphics performance, but doesn’t draw too much power, allowing you to play games on battery for a few hours. The trade-off, though, is that it’s not great at moving above 1080p on medium settings in most games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The AMD Z1 Extreme is using a Zen 4 CPU core, along with an RDNA 3 GPU core. We already have Zen 5 processors on the market, like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review">Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a>, but we’re still waiting for RDNA 4 to show up. With how late in the year we are, my bet is that AMD will show off its next-generation graphics tech at CES 2025. If that happens, we should see the Z2, or its equivalent, some time in mid-to-late 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft being Microsoft, though, it’s entirely possible that it could work with a chipmaker like AMD to create custom silicon to bring the Xbox handheld to the next level, which would make it stand out in a market that’s becoming increasingly saturated with new handhelds all the time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-rockstar-chases-bigger-better-more-immersive-worlds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It has been 23 years since Rockstar Games pioneered the 3D open world with Grand Theft Auto 3 and ever since that industry-shifting release the studio has remained at the very forefront of the genre. Despite there being more contenders to the throne than ever these days, Rockstar’s worlds have consistently proven themselves to be generational leaders largely thanks to the pursuit of immersive realism. The network of overlapping systems and handcrafted elements that make up places like Los Santos and Saint Denis are designed to offer such a sense of authenticity that these simulated cities truly feel alive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The craft behind such digital realities is something that Ben Hinchliffe knows well. A former Rockstar designer now working in the immersive field of virtual reality, he helped put together the worlds of L.A. Noire, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Red Dead Redemption 2 – games that each pushed the bar higher and higher. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/15/la-noire-1731677045841.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">L.A. Noire's facial capture tech made conversations feel very realistic (if quite uncanny) Image credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For 2011’s L.A. Noire, much of that immersion came via its groundbreaking facial capture technology that was able to recreate an actor’s every sneering lip and twitching eye. It’s the feature that liquidated developer Team Bondi will be best remembered for. But Rockstar, who acted as both publisher and co-developer on the project, offered contributions that were informed by its proven strengths in open world design. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s something that will no doubt raise a few eyebrows, as L.A. Noire is widely considered a poor open world game due to its lack of side activities and map-populating content. “Because the focus was on Phelps and the police, you were kind of boxed in a little bit,” says Hinchliffe. “How far would Phelps go and what could he do? He couldn't do anything too outrageous. He's law enforcement. It did shape a lot of the content as to where we could take it. Let's say you were a criminal or an outlaw, you probably could have gotten away with a lot more in terms of content and what you could have done.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite this, L.A. Noire’s approach to a sprawling city was closer to Grand Theft Auto’s guiding philosophy than you may expect. It was all about <em>authenticity</em>, something that has only become increasingly important to the studio over the last decade.  “[The aim was] trying to get that vibe of the 1940s era and the setting and making sure that all felt very authentic in terms of how it was portrayed throughout the game,” explains Hinchliffe. L.A. Noire’s achievements in this area are largely uncontested thanks to a recreation of the city of angels that is so period-accurate even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/night-and-the-city" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people who lived in LA during the 1940s praised its depiction</a>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even the hand scripted stuff looks like it's organic because of Rockstar's tools</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A reflection of that authentic, painstaking-recreated LA would later be found in Grand Theft Auto 5’s Los Santos, which features large sections of city streets that are map-accurate to the metropolis that inspired it. But realism isn’t achieved by architectural accuracy alone – people are as important as pavements. Hinchliffe worked on several of L.A. Noire’s random crimes, a human element that helped bring the digital city to life. There were mobsters lurking in the backalleys that didn’t care about the main story, and you’d never know when they’d strike next. They lent some authentic everyday frustration to the job of a detective – would you focus on the case, or do your public duty and clean up another one of the city’s messes?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those random crimes would indirectly evolve into Grand Theft Auto 5’s world events, in which pedestrians would call out for help after being mugged or carjacked. They appeared as part of Rockstar’s mandate to “go bigger and better in every aspect.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was making the cars feel like they handled better, having better damage on the vehicles, having the tyres deflate and stuff, having everything react more realistically,” recalls Hinchliffe. “It was a grand vision of just pushing everything forward.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The key to enhancing GTA 5’s immersive qualities were the dozens and dozens of automated systems that made its simulation of city life feel truly organic. A tyre bursting was a natural reaction to a player’s driving habits rather than a scripted sequence. But Rockstar learned that sometimes it took a lie to create something that feels like the truth.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/15/gta-5-1731677294732.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">GTA 5's traffic behaviour could be hand-crafted to create immersive, cinematic situations. Image credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hinchliffe worked on The Meltdown, a mission in which you must help paparazzi photographer Beverly Felton score a picture of a drunken celebrity caught in a police chase. To create an authentic race through the streets of Los Santos, Hinchliffe controlled <em>everything</em>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of the traffic in that chase is fully hand-scripted,” he says. “It's not ambient traffic. We've made the cars follow a set route and cross over at the set time, and have a garbage truck just pull around the corner at the right time. We've hand scripted all of it to give the player the best experience and the best cinematic feel for that chase.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rockstar’s systems are very clever,” he adds. “The tools are very powerful for design. You can switch between hand scripted and generic behaviors very easily, and even the hand scripted stuff looks like it's organic because of the tools.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That approach really comes into its own in Red Dead Redemption 2. While the 2018 western is Rockstar’s most simulation-heavy open world to date, much of its authenticity only exists because the world is so authored. The frontier may feel alive and reactive, but behind the scenes are thousands of hand-crafted responses to the many actions players can perform. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/15/rdr-2-1731677309650.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Red Dead Redemption 2's conversation system gave impressive, authentic life to every NPC. Image credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“A big aspect of Red Dead 2 was that the higher ups wanted to push forward that feeling of the NPCs feeling more real and make that world around you feel like a living, breathing world,” Hinchliffe recalls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You've got these smaller towns and less of a population density, so you need the NPCs to feel a bit more real,” he explains. “It was a big drive to [allow players] to talk to people and be more involved in the world, to make you feel bad if you just shoot a random person. [Because of that conversation system] maybe you'd feel a bit worse about that than just mowing down 20 people in GTA 5.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pretty much every NPC in Red Dead Redemption 2 has some kind of interior life. Even if that life is just riding a cargo wagon along the same route over and over, it’s a job with a destination that players can turn into a highway robbery opportunity. This level of detail is vital for Red Dead Redemption because of the limited population density Hinchliffe mentioned. At the modern metropolitan scale of Grand Theft Auto, though, with its streets home to thousands of pedestrians, such a sense of authentic life is much more difficult to achieve. It feels like a pipe dream to expect the upcoming Grand Theft Auto 6 to replicate RDR 2’s immersive achievements… but that’s not to say it’s impossible. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don't see any reason why you couldn't have that Red Dead Redemption 2 level of NPC interaction in a much larger scale game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hinchliffe worked on Grand Theft Auto 6 until he left Rockstar in 2022, which means he both knows the scope of its ambition and is bound by a Non-Disclosure Agreement to keep that scope a secret. But as a veteran designer of open world games, he has his own informed opinions about what is possible.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“From a theoretical standpoint, and what you might be able to do if you had the budget and the team size, I don't see any reason why you couldn't have that [Red Dead Redemption 2] level of NPC interaction in a much larger scale game,” he says.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Such interactions are not where his current priorities lie, though. Hinchliffe now works at British indie developer Just Add Water, acting as lead designer on virtual reality construction simulator Dig VR. In many ways it’s a galaxy away from his experiences at Rockstar, but there is an element that unites his past and present: immersion. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“VR just adds another level of immersion by default because you're in the space,” Hinchliffe says. “But it's harder to then make the player feel like they're immersed and that place is real because they're <em>in </em>it.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Obviously VR is super tactile,” he continues. “You are using your hands in most stuff, and the challenge is making sure that the things you are doing with your hands or anything you interact with feels real. If it doesn't, you can instantly break the immersion.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those challenges really highlight two very different approaches to immersion. Where in GTA it’s all about the detailed city-wide simulation, in VR it’s about physically turning the key in the ignition. It’s smaller, more intimate. That requires a complete reset of your expectations and ambitions when compared to traditional gaming. That goes for much more than just immersion, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A huge achievement for us [in Dig VR] was getting the dynamic terrain working so you can fully dig the ground and then dump it out,” he explains. “That's a first for any Meta Quest game. Now, people in the traditional flat screen world are going ‘Whoop-de-do, you've done dynamic terrain. There's like a million games with dynamic terrain. What's the big deal?’ But for us in VR, that's a huge deal because there was no reference point, no one to learn from. We just had to figure that out and make it work.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The current state of virtual reality feels like a repeat of traditional gaming’s infancy. Because the medium is so different, everything demands starting from scratch. And so Dig VR’s achievements are literally groundbreaking. Furthermore, it may inspire other VR developers to incorporate dynamic terrain in their projects. “It's those baby steps of helping each other and helping the medium go forwards,” says Hinchliffe. “As each game comes out with a new feature that hasn't been done in VR, the whole space starts iterating and moving forwards.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">23 years ago, Rockstar transformed its Scalextric-esque 2D roads into a fully three-dimensional city. It pushed the industry forwards, paving the way not just for its own games but laying the groundwork for the likes of Assassin’s Creed, Forza Horizon, and Cyberpunk 2077. The open world genre is now a patchwork of different developer contributions, each one having iterated and moved the concept forward. And next year, with the release of Grand Theft Auto 6, we’ll finally see what Rockstar’s next contribution to immersive worlds will be.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. <br>Views expressed in this interview are the personal opinions of Ben Hinchliffe and do not represent the thoughts or opinions of Rockstar Games. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Originally set to follow on from Episode 1 and 2, its cancellation instead left the series dangling on a cliffhanger it never directly resolved. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, on the occasion of Half-Life 2's 20th anniversary, Valve has opened up about its development in a brand-new documentary that shows never-before-seen work-in-progress footage, a brand-new Ice Gun, and a raft of new concept art. You can see the gameplay segment from the documentary in the video below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the details shown in the video, Episode 3 would have been set in the Arctic, and it would have focused on Alyx as a companion character. Aside from the Ice Gun, the footage shows a blob-like enemy that could split into multiple parts. According to the documentary, the team had complete a "collection of playable levels in no particular order" and expected to be able to release the game within a year or two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the new gameplay footage, writer Marc Laidlaw, founder Gabe Newell, and others also talk frankly about why it was never released, ultimately chalking it up to a lack of compelling new ideas and other reasons. At one point Laidlaw jokes, "Are we allowed to cry in this documentary?"</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We could have shipped it. It wouldn't have been that hard</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason for Episode 3's cancellation has been the subject of much discussion over the years, not the least because Episode 2 ended on a grim cliffhanger. In an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-explains-why-half-life-2-episode-3-was-never-made">interview with IGN</a> shortly before Alyx's release, Valve level designer Dario Casali described it partly as an issue of scope screep. Laidlaw would later reveal the plot in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/25/half-life-2-episode-3-potential-plot-revealed-by-series-writer">story called "Epistle 3,"</a> featuring "Gertie Freemont" and "Alex Vaunt" — plays on Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/16/half-life-2-20th-anniversary-documentary-1-53-41-screenshot-1731720807178.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Half-Life 2: Episode 3 would have been set in the Arctic and featured an Ice Gun. Image source: Half-Life 2 Documentary.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's possible to detect a lot of regret over the decision not to go through Episode 3. At one point Laidlaw jokes, "Are we allowed to cry in this documentary?" Others talk about how Episode 3 probably could have been released in hindsight. Newell says, "We could have shipped it. It wouldn't have been that hard. My personal failure was being stumped. I couldn't figure out why Episode 3 was pushing anything forward."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve finally released Half-Life Alyx in 2020, sending <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-alyx-ending-explained">the story spinning off in a new direction</a>, but many fans remain wistful about Half-Life: Episode 3 (not to mention the long lost Half-Life 3). Now, 20 years after its release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-2-20th-anniversary-update-includes-developer-commentary-improved-graphics-and-a-2-hour-documentary">Valve is celebrating Half-Life 2</a> amid unconfirmed rumors that a <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-3/leaks-deadlock-details" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new game is in the works</a>. In the meantime, it's worth watching the entire documentary, which delves deep into Half-Life 2's fraught development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image source: Half-Life 2 Documentary / Valve</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.
