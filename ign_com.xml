            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"They left us out of the Battle Pass."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> fans are convinced the game will soon feature a mini-season dedicated to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-simpsons">The Simpsons</a>, following the in-game arrival of the show's Kang and Kodos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rumors of a Simpsons-themed mini-season being in development have persisted throughout this year, with speculation further fuelled by the game's recent Star Wars mini-season being labelled as "Chapter 6: Mini-Season 1." With Fortnite's Chapters (essentially, the game's annual eras) typically lasting 12 months, fans believe a Mini-Season 2 is therefore likely at some point before the Chapter's expected end in December. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, as Fortnite kicks off its big Halloween celebrations, an in-game glider item has been spotted featuring The Simpsons' alien duo Kang and Kodos, with its description even referencing a dedicated battle pass.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">FORTNITE SIMPSONS GLIDER LEAKED <a href="https://t.co/UfWGDw1vrZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/UfWGDw1vrZ</a></p>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/1976199725121716706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">This glider marks the first time any character from The Simpsons has appeared in Fortnite, which has to date already collaborated with pretty much every major Disney-owned property (including characters from Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Avatar, and fellow Fox-owned franchises such as Family Guy). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reportedly, Kang and Kodos will be a free quest reward given to players in the near future — likely as a teaser for the game's upcoming The Simpsons extravaganza, and perhaps a nod to the show's own annual Halloween celebrations, Treehouse of Horror.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Simpsons itself recently began its 37th season with an episode in which Marge reminisced about the '90s, while Homer reflected on the pace of movies ending up on streaming platforms. Alongside the season's launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-simpsons-isnt-changing-to-do-big-topical-things-like-south-park-cause-the-topical-is-so-chaotic-and-nuts">The Simpsons' co-showrunner Matt Selman said the show's creators had no desire for the series to become more topical</a> "'cause the topical is so chaotic and nuts."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite fans have big hopes for Fortnite's prospective The Simpsons crossover, which looks set to arrive during the same year-end period that previously saw the game temporarily transition back to its OG Chapter 1 map (in 2023) and then a Snoop Dogg/Eminem-remixed version of its Chapter 2 map (in 2024). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could The Simpsons be used as a twist to revisit Fortnite's Chapter 3 era, or are players headed for an all-new map themed around Springfield? For now, Fortnite remains busy rolling out its busiest Fortnitemares ever which features collaborations with Wednesday, the Scooby-Doo gang, plus Ghostface from Scream. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last night's Fortnitemares reveal didn't go totally to plan, however, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-halloween-plans-get-off-to-messy-start-following-social-media-snafu-involving-doja-cat-and-a-sex-toy">rap star Doja Cat broke kayfabe to criticise the posting of a message, designed to appear as if it was written by her, that referenced a sex toy</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

In a separate piece, the legendary video game auteur shared how he had a very different experience of the current Expo 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hideo-kojima-says-metal-gear-and-death-stranding-wouldnt-exist-without-the-globalist-and-futuristic-outlook-he-learned-from-1970s-osaka-world-expo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>, the 62-year-old Kojima <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/55165" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote an essay</u></a> for An-An magazine detailing how Expo '70 shaped his worldview: "Without that Expo, I wouldn’t have developed my future-oriented and globalized outlook. Metal Gear and Death Stranding would not have come into being."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Osaka hosted the Expo '70, with 76 countries and 32 organizations participating (source: <a href="https://taiyounotou-expo70.jp/en/about/expo70/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Expo '70 Commemorative Park official website</u></a>). Kojima said that at the time he had just started elementary school and lived near the event site. This gave him the opportunity to visit the Expo many times.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/09/gettyimages-2222468111-1759999722848.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hideo Kojima has revealed how visiting an Expo in 1970 shaped his worldview.

"Whenever you entered a pavilion, you received a badge," he remembered, adding that children proudly showed off their collections to each other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main theme of Expo '70 was 'Progress and Harmony for Mankind.' It even had its own theme song — Haruo Minami’s 'Sekai no kuni kara konnichiwa' (Hello from the countries of the world), which Kojima quoted in his essay — with lyrics that focus on saying "hello" and "holding hands" across countries and borders (the song is on <a href="https://youtu.be/NyRgp8r0mwo?si=73PZdSfGxM561D8U" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube</u></a> with English subtitles).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At the Expo, I experienced 'Progress and Harmony for Mankind' up close. I said 'hello' and 'shook hands' with (avant-garde artist) Taro Okamoto, (sci-fi novelist) Sakyo Komatsu, (architects) Kenzo Tange and Kisho Kurokawa, and (fashion designers) Junko Koshino and Hanae Mori. It was all a shocking 'close encounter of the third kind,'" Kojima remembered. "Technology, science, design, fashion, history, the world, culture, society. You could say that that 'hello' back then shaped who I became. 'Shaking hands' with the Expo changed my life and my vision of the future."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima explained that "the Expo's greatness wasn't just in the glimpses it offered of cutting-edge technology and the daily life of the future. It showed me the global diversity of nations, ethnicities, races, religions, customs, and histories. It embodied the essence of 'past and future' and 'the world and harmony.' Without that Expo, I wouldn’t have developed my future-oriented and globalized outlook. Metal Gear and Death Stranding would not have come into being."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the major attractions of Expo '70 was the Moon Rock at the U.S. pavilion, which had been brought back from the Moon by Apollo 12 astronauts the previous year. Despite his many visits, Kojima said that "unfortunately, the U.S. pavilion, where I’d hoped to see the Moon Rock, was too crowded, so I never got to see it with my own eyes." He also recalled waiting over two hours to get into the U.S.S.R pavilion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what does Kojima feel about the current Expo 2025 that is being held in Osaka, and how did his experience compare? In a <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/67790" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>follow-up essay</u></a> published in An-An, Kojima wrote about visiting Expo 2025 on a very rainy day, camera in tow again: "I wanted to see for myself how 'globalism' and 'visions of the future' have changed over the past 55 years, and how the baton will be passed on (to future generations)." However, the experience gave Kojima a "strange feeling."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Metal Gear Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer explained: "I didn't get that sense of a tremendous future like I did as a child (at Expo '70). It wasn't thrilling or exciting. Just a ceaseless, predictable tomorrow stretching on and on. It wasn't that there was no 'future' — rather that I couldn't ascertain the next 'tomorrow' for myself. The 'future' I dreamed of at that (1970) Expo — I've already experienced most of it. Robots, videophones and moving walkways have become commonplace. The tomorrow that this (2025) Expo promotes is one that children will witness."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima gave the opinion that World Expos are primarily for children, as they are the ones who will take mankind into the future. Whether the futuristic designs at the 2025 Expo will be representative of what the real future will be is "something old people can never know." However, Kojima added that he enjoyed the Expo: "Although I will not be able to experience this future firsthand, I plan to go again."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Any player of Metal Gear Solid or Death Stranding doesn’t have to look far to see how both series feature diverse casts of characters, with stories often set in the near future that grapple with both the tremendous possibilities and dangers of technology. MGS1 explored genetic engineering and the concept of gene-therapy enhanced soldiers, MGS2 delved into the dangers of internet censorship and human-sounding AI chatbots (making it an interesting revisit in 2025), while MGS4 showed a mech-filled future in which paramilitary conglomerates wage endless wars for profit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With its Chiral Network, Death Stranding holds up a mirror to the benefits and dangers of the internet and digital society, and the struggle to reconnect a fragmented, post-apocalyptic world. Legacy and passing on the future to subsequent generations are also big Kojima themes, and it seems they were shaped by his childhood experiences of Expo '70.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a side note, the Expo '70 site is still open to the public today, although all the pavilions that awed the young Kojima have since been demolished. Now called the Expo'70 Commemorative Park, it still features the event's symbolic Tower of the Sun, a sculpture by Taro Okamoto.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Kojima Productions.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has assembled its largest ever cast of Halloween crossovers in time for the game's latest Fortnitemares celebrations, including Wednesday Addams, though the event's announcement got off to a messy start last night due to a social media snafu involving rap star Doja Cat and mention of a sex toy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year's spooky shenanigans are partly centered on musician and self-proclaimed Fortnite fan Doja Cat, who <a href="https://youtu.be/OdE3Qyy61kw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently popped up on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</a> to officially reveal her in-game alter ego Mother of Thorns — and is a boss character during the event. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last night, Fortnite hosted a brief Doja Cat "takeover" of its X account in advance of the above trailer being released. However, the idea quickly turned messy when "Doja Cat," via Fortnite's account, seemingly posting a reference to "rose toys" (a vibrating adult toy). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back on Doja Cat's <em>actual</em> X account, the rapper broke the fourth wall and stated that Fortnite's posts were all pre-planned, and that she'd told Epic Games not to make the sex toys reference. "S*** cringe as f*** now I'm embarrassed," Doja Cat wrote, followed by a wilted rose emoji. Fortnite then deleted the post referencing "rose toys" shortly after. Doja Cat then deleted all of her messages referencing the incident.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/08/untitled-1-1759952211464.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite and Doja Cat's now-deleted posts. Image credit: X / IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some onlookers have suggested the whole incident was planned, including Doja Cat's typically-messy fourth wall break. But that theory would seem to rely on Fortnite itself being comfortable posting about an adult toy on its social media account which is followed by millions of young fans, which seems unlikely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, you'll be able to snap up a Doja Cat skin from Fortnite's Shop, alongside an array of other famous faces. These include (deep breath): Wednesday Addams, Jason Voorhees, Scooby-Doo (plus also Shaggy, Velma, Daphne and Fred), Black Phone's Grabber, Terrifier's Art the Clown, Ghostface and... even more. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/09/gettyimages-2238260585-1759997531382.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Doja Cat's Jimmy Fallon appearance, sitting on her Fortnite crown of thorns.

As for Fortnite itself, its new spooky gameplay extends beyond the game's main Battle Royale and Zero Build modes. A fresh Reload map, Nitemare Island, will debut tomorrow, October 10, featuring a Halloween-themed town and looming castle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year's Fortnitemares comes hot on the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-fortnite-reveals-kpop-demon-hunters-rumi-outfit">the game's big KPop Demon Hunters collaboration</a>, which will run until November 1.
