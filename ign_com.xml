            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Higurashi and When They Cry creator Ryukishi07 has opened up about writing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f"><u>Silent Hill f</u></a>, likening the game's supernatural and psychological elements to, uh, "salad dressing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the hype train is firmly out of the station for Silent Hill f — the upcoming Silent Hill title that resurrects a franchise that hasn't had a new mainline game since 2012 — we haven't heard very much from writer Ryukishi07 at all, which made his recent appearance at Anime Expo 2025 in LA last month particularly exciting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a panel alongside producer Motoi Okamoto and composer and sound designer Akira Yamaoka, Ryukishi07 admitted he'd approached this project differently from how he typically writes a book, focusing the story on a single central theme.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202507/48146" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Famitsu</u></a>, via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/silent-hill-f-will-be-like-a-salad-dressing-of-psychological-and-supernatural-horror-new-writer-rykishi07-says/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>, Ryukishi07 said that it would initially be difficult for players to distinguish between the game's supernatural and psychological horror motifs, as they'll often feel like one and the same. As the game progresses, however, players will understand more of what's going on —and it's here that the game "will be like a salad dressing", he said. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Explaining the metaphor, Ryukishi07 said it was like the two elements would feel distinct, like a salad dressing where the oil and other ingredients like vinegar eventually separate, even if there were initially blended together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a little taken aback by such a comparison, I promise you are not alone. Ryukishi07 did, however, add that in addition to uncovering facts and clues about the town of Ebisugaoka as we progress, plenty will be left for us to interpret or speculate on — which is what Silent Hill fans love to do, of course.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ryukishi07 also revealed that Silent Hill f's story isn't just one of horror and torment. Like many of Silent Hill's back catalog, this game explores aspects that make us human, including love, sadness, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f is not a sequel to any of the existing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/silent-hill"><u>Silent Hill games</u></a>. Instead, it will offer a standalone story "independent from the series." That came from publisher Konami itself, which finally confirmed on X/Twitter that the latest instalment of the horror series — which is usually, if not always, based in a sleepy resort town on east-coast America — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-a-completely-new-title-that-people-who-have-never-played-the-series-can-enjoy-konami-says"><u>will be "a completely new title" that "people who have never played the Silent Hill series can enjoy</u></a>."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-combat-has-a-heavier-focus-on-melee-and-is-more-action-oriented-than-silent-hill-2-remakes-producer-says">Okamoto said that tougher combat</a>, with the visuals and music's "juxtaposition between beauty and terror," along with the "terrible beauty of the game’s monster design," makes for a terrifying adventure. Even the puzzles are apparently "grounded in psychological anguish and suffering." Yikes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f takes us to 1960s Japan, where we'll follow Hinako Shimizu, a teenager struggling under the pressure of expectations from her friends, family, and society. As displayed at the beginning of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/silent-hill-f-official-japanese-trailer"><u>Japanese-language reveal trailer</u></a> back in March, it is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-the-first-in-konamis-horror-series-to-get-an-18-rating-in-japan"><u>the first Silent Hill game to get an 18+ rating certification in Japan</u></a>. It's out for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series on September 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

More!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft's next big patch for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is available today, July 29, 2025, and the publisher has now given a detailed rundown of everything included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-expansion-claws-of-awaji-release-date-revealed">previously announced</a>, Title Update 1.0.7 adds New Game Plus mode, which will unlock as soon as you hit the credits after completing the game's story. From here, you have a couple of options: either to restart the game from scratch, or pick up the action from when Naoe first arrives at the game's hideout. Either way, your hard-earned gear, skills, allies and hideout progression will carry over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you're playing New Game Plus or not, there's a level cap increase from 60 to 80, and a boost in the Knowledge Rank cap from 8 to 10, allowing you to counter the game's higher-level enemies with the ability to unlock more skills. You can also now upgrade gear at your Forge to level 4, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sweat your way through Shadows' story a second time via New Game Plus and you'll unlock a gold katana and long katana for Naoe and Yasuke, respectively, and also snag the last of the following three new achievements/trophies, which this update also adds:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Enjoy the Ride:</strong> Reach Level 80 </li><li><strong>Stars Unseen:</strong> Reach Knowledge Rank 10 </li><li><strong>Worth its Wait:</strong> Complete the story on New Game Plus </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Ubisoft has rebalanced some of the game's money and resources. Players will likely be happy to see a boosted amount of Mon now given from selling items, while purchased items cost less. You'll also get more resources from dismantling items and from end of season chests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft is set to continue updating Shadows for the forseeable future, with a further patch due in early September that will add the ability to fast-forward the time of day and better unfog the world map when synchronising viewpoints. Assassin's Creed Shadows' first major expansion, Claws of Awaji, then arrives on September 16 as the game's first paid add-on — though it will be free for anyone who originally pre-ordered the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Find today's full patch notes below:
