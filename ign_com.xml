In fact, the only Sony-published game to have a higher concurrent record than Stellar Blade is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a>, which is, of course, a multiplayer game. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">PC-specific features include AI upscaling via Nvidia DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 3, an unlocked framerate, Japanese and Chinese voiceover, ultrawide display support, higher resolution environment textures, and DualSense support for haptic feedback and trigger effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PC version was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-devs-closely-discussing-mysterious-pc-region-lock-issue-with-sony"><u>originally region locked in 100+ countries</u></a>, but is now available in <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1928543205097705548" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>"over 250 regions."</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-director-cant-wait-to-see-our-pc-mods"><u>And yes, there are mods</u></a>.

Now SAG-AFTRA has formally suspended strike action as of noon PT yesterday (June 11). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-sag-aftra-video-game-actors-strike-means-for-gamers"><u>SAG-AFTRA video game strike</u></a> was instigated back in July 2024 after the union and the major game companies — Activision, Blindlight, Disney Character Voices, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Formosa Interactive, Insomniac Games, Take 2 Productions, and WB Games — that sit on the board failed to agree on AI provisions. Over 98% of members subsequently voted to strike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the union hasn't quite signed everything off — there's a special meeting later today, June 12, to consider the agreement — if all goes well, the paperwork will then be sent out to the union's membership for ratification.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/12/gettyimages-2164192960-1749717137275.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The video game performers strike is over.

Players reported that a number of ongoing games such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny-2"><u>Destiny 2</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/world-of-warcraft"><u>World of Warcraft</u></a> appeared to leave some NPCs unvoiced in otherwise voiced scenes, likely due to the strike, and late last year, SAG-AFTRA struck <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/league-of-legends"><u>League of Legends</u></a> after Riot <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sag-aftra-strikes-league-of-legends-over-alleged-flagrant-violation-of-labor-law"><u>allegedly tried to subvert the strike by canceling a game in response</u></a>. Activision also confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-character-recast-after-players-expressed-concern-about-new-voices"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 characters were recast</u></a> after players expressed concern about new voices, and Epic Games is facing an unfair labor charge after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/voice-actor-union-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-over-fortnites-ai-darth-vader"><u>SAG-AFTRA filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)</u></a> when the company implemented an AI-voiced Darth Vader NPC in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite"><u>Fortnite</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're wondering if the industrial action was necessary, this story from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-actor-ashly-burch-says-sonys-ai-aloy-video-left-her-feeling-worried-about-game-performance-as-an-art-form"><u>Horizon actor Ashly Burch may help. </u></a>In a now-deleted video, Sony Interactive Entertainment director of software engineering, Sharwin Raghoebardajal, has a conversation with an AI-powered Aloy via voice prompts and AI-generated speech and facial animations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The voice heard coming from Aloy's mouth was clearly not that of Burch, but rather a robotic voice similar to those heard from text-to-speech voice generators. AI Aloy's facial movements are stiff, and her eyes appear lifeless as she converses with Raghoebardajal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You have to get our consent before you make an AI version of us in any form, you have to compensate us fairly, and you have to tell us how you’re using this AI double,” Burch said at the time. “I love this industry and this art form so much, and I want there to be a new generation of actors. I want there to be so many more incredible game performances. I want to be able to continue to do this job. If [the union and striking performers] don’t win, that future is really compromised."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Well, wonder no more, as one YouTuber has taken the mask off and shown the little details hiding underneath the coverings of Elden Ring Nightreign's cast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaiC0doOclE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zullie the Witch</a> posted a behind-the-mask look at Nightreign's cast on June 5. All of them have distinct models, with some surprising details under the hood.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are just little curiosities, like Ironeye's face being fully modeled from the front. Zullie also notes that the Nightfarers' eye colors change depending on their skin. Other characters have some fun ties to other FromSoftware games, like the Duchess' similarity to Dark Souls 3's Firekeeper.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Revealing the face of characters like Ironeye or Executor is neat, but the real question I'm sure you're asking is whether the avian Guardian is truly a bird, or if he has a human face underneath? Well, the answer is that yes, he is truly a bird. The Revenant also hides a skull beneath her porcelain facade, though, so there are still some surprises in store for those who haven't seen them in-game yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there aren't any profound lore discoveries to be made here, they do add a little extra character to each of the Nightfarers, and show off FromSoft's attention to detail, even down to the tiny things that would probably go unnoticed in most players' runs of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The one strange note is Wylder, who does not seem to have a face model at all. This might just be a design quirk, but it's interesting to imagine there might be some deeper lore reason for his under-armor presence remaining a mystery.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign players are slowly getting to grips with the game, and some are already completing impressive challenges.
