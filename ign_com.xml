            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plus, massive discounts on the PlayStation Store. </h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re coming up on Labor Day weekend, which closes out the summer and tends to be a popular occasion to drop prices. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/labor-day-sales-2025">Labor Day sales</a> have already gone live at most major retailers, with deals worth checking out on everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/target-lego-deals-labor-day-sale-2025">LEGO sets</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-gaming-pc-labor-day-sale-2025">gaming PCs</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the first thing I’m looking for in any of these sales is discounts on physical games. Surprisingly enough, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-labor-day-sale-2025">Amazon's Labor Day sale</a> has listed first-time discounts on some of the latest and greatest PS5 games, while the PlayStation Store has launched its own sale on digital editions. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon Drops Prices on the Latest PS5 Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The physical games I’ve listed above are all at or close to their lowest-ever prices. The discounts aren’t mind-blowing, I know, but they are the first price drops we’ve seen on recent releases like Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 and College Football 26, both of which just came out in July. The Tony Hawk remake has been especially popular here at IGN, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review">Luke Reilly’s review</a> saying it "proves yet again the series’ over-the-top skateboarding formula is totally timeless." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another personal recommendation is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">Split Fiction</a>, the latest two-person adventure from It Takes Two developer Hazelight Studios. This discount is made all the better by the fact that the co-op game only requires one person to buy it, while the other can download the game through Friend’s Pass. You could go 50/50 with a friend and grab the GOTY contender for $20 each. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Split Fiction - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">SEGA is generally going hard on the discounts right now, with an ongoing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/SEGAPublisherSale2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publisher sale on Steam</a> and price cuts on those games at pretty much every retailer. Last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> is the highlight I've included here, but you can also find discounts on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">Persona games</a> as well as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-games-in-order">Yakuza series</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Playstation’s Ready, Set, Play! Sale: Up to 75% Off Digital Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While not branded as having anything to do with Labor Day, the Playstation Store has launched its Ready, Set, Play! sale at the same time as the holiday weekend. The promotion mainly applies to digital games and features separate discounts from what you’ll find on physical games at retailers like Amazon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You won’t find as many discounts on new releases (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-2025">PlayStation Plus</a> is the way to go for those), but the deals you will find are pretty massive. I’d take it as a good opportunity to do some homework before the big sequels we have coming up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A bundle of the two most recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-games-in-order">Resident Evil games</a> (outside of remakes) has dropped to just $19.99, giving you a solid gateway to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, while The Witcher 3 drops below $8 as we get ready for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv">The Witcher 4</a>. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">What About PS5 Console Deals? </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, I haven’t seen any discounts on PS5 consoles, which isn’t too surprising in light of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-5-price-rises-for-us">recent price hikes</a>. If you're desperate for the console, I highly recommend checking out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/certified-refurbished-ps5-deals-at-playstation">PlayStation's Certified Refurbished options</a>. Otherwise, here's to hoping we miraculously see some deals around Black Friday. <br>
