Joe and Cobra, with their high-tech vehicles, creative codenames, and the red and blue lasers their weapons shot. For longtime board game players, the Axis &amp; Allies series of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war board games</a> may hold a similar nostalgia with its large amounts of miniatures, its emphasis on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a>, and tense <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dice-rolling-board-games">dice rolls</a>, all set among the height of World War II. Now under the care of Renegade Game Studios, Axis &amp; Allies are letting players experience the confrontations between the Joes and Cobra in the new G.I. Joe: Battle for the Arctic (minus the colorful lasers, unfortunately).</p><div catalogid="dd241838-99b5-4b20-adc7-ccc3128f3649" id="214115"><div id="214115" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>G.I. Joe: Battle for The Arctic Circle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle for the Arctic Circle puts up to four players in the boots of either G.I. Joe (playing as Keelhaul and Snow Job) or Cobra (as Destro and Cobra Commander) in a battle to control the North Pole, as both sides vie for control of points around the map and establish their hold on the Arctic Circle. From the moment you open the box, it’s clear that the goal of this game is to give the younger and more inexperienced audience a fun and interesting on-ramp to the wider world of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/axis-allies-40th-anniversary-edition-board-game-review">Axis &amp; Allies</a> offerings, and I think the team at Renegade Game Studios succeeds.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Battle for the Arctic Circle is a far less imposing beast for new players to tackle.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Popping off the box lid, I was greeted with the familiar small plastic miniatures and the other usual accouterments of an A&amp;A title, just with a G.I. Joe flair. For fans who have played previous versions of Axis &amp; Allies, you will feel right at home here. Turns are still broken up the same way – you buy new units at the beginning of your turn, have your separate combat move and non-combat move phases, and battles with their attacker vs. defender rolls are all still here – but everything is just a bit more condensed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The number of miniatures is rather small, meaning players won’t need to contend with managing massive armies around the map or rolling for giant battles. With a smaller map, you won’t be earning large amounts of Reinforcement Points (Arctic Circle’s equivalent of IPCs in other A&amp;A games) to buy more units, and along with other subtle tweaks, Battle for the Arctic Circle is a far less imposing beast for new players to tackle. That said, this game does have some entirely unique mechanics and tweaks that also set it apart, some of which I enjoyed more than others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a first for the A&amp;A series, Battle for the Arctic Circle abandons the real-world geographical boundaries separating areas and uses hexes, a decision that works out really well. I appreciate the real-world borders in the previous games from an immersion sense, but they are also one of the biggest issues I have with the other editions, where everything can just start feeling cramped – an issue I was happy to say I didn't encounter here. While this is also due in part to having fewer units to contend with overall, there is no denying that the larger, uniform hex spaces played a role too. I wouldn't complain if Renegade adopts this method in future games as well (something more likely to happen in future spin-off games like Battle for the Arctic Circle than mainline games, to be fair).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another new addition unique to this G.I. Joe variant of A&amp;A comes in the form of the diabolic “Weather Dominator” device that the Cobra forces have access to on their turns. This dastardly piece of machinery, for the cost of a single RP, can turn a single non-land-only hex into an ice-covered tile that can be traversed by land units. This is a neat feature, and it proves to be incredibly important to use as Cobra to try to quickly capture nearby victory point tiles. Cobra starts with a significantly lower amount of RP to spend each turn, so using the Dominator to score some early points is a must. I really like the concept of it as well; a weather-controlling device being used by the bad guys is a quintessential ’80s cartoon story trope, and I’m here for it. To keep things fair, the Joes can use their cruiser ships to try and break up the ice, which can lead to some rather unfortunate situations where Cobra units are stranded in enemy territory without backup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the biggest change are the unique commander powers that each player gets. While there are fewer armies to take command of in this game (only four as opposed to the more common five or six armies in the mainline A&amp;A games), each commander has a special ability that can be triggered if the correct conditions are met. Once a turn after damage is assigned, for example, Cobra Commander can sacrifice his own units to deal additional hits to the enemy (yes, Cobra Commander has kamikaze units). Snow Job's commander power grants their land units an additional space of movement during their non-combat movement phase. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In principle, I enjoy these unique powers, but I also found them not to all be created equally, with the Joes' powers being far more usable than Cobra’s – especially Destro’s. In Destro’s case, he gains a bonus whenever he attacks a Joe-controlled tile that contains six or more units, a scenario I perhaps encountered only once or twice during all my plays of the game. Had the ability applied when he was defending as well, it would be far more reliable or impactful. However, considering Destro has to attack to gain the bonus, it made the ability rarely used, which made playing as Destro less exciting than the others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I like the idea of the commanders having special abilities, adding a slight asymmetrical component, but the balancing of the skills currently on offer felt lacking. I wish that each side had additional commanders to choose from, with teams being able to pick only two to use. Regardlessy, the whole thing is a neat idea and a fun mix-up within the A&amp;A system that I would like to see carried over into future spin-off titles.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Where to Buy</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aoXvNm?object_uuid=f9397848-0661-4a75-857c-d030326ded81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zEjXV4?object_uuid=f9397848-0661-4a75-857c-d030326ded81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Target</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QqXb4G?object_uuid=f9397848-0661-4a75-857c-d030326ded81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Walmart</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/avXmx2?object_uuid=f9397848-0661-4a75-857c-d030326ded81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Hasbro Pulse</strong></a><strong></strong></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/akRW76?object_uuid=f9397848-0661-4a75-857c-d030326ded81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Renegade Store</strong></a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 15, 2025 6:30 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Battle for the Arctic Circle does a commendable job of presenting the systems of Axis &amp; Allies in a way that will be far more approachable for younger, new players while also giving those individuals a great on-ramp to the larger A&amp;A series. It also provides an option for those intrigued by the longtime war game franchise but turned off by the subject matter, giving them a solid war game without the historical complications. In both cases, I think GI Joe: Battle for the Arctic Circle is a fun game to add to your collection. 

That said, outside of pure nostalgia for the Joes, I don't think there is much here for longtime A&amp;A players or for board game hobbyists looking for a deep war game that doesn’t necessarily fit into those cases mentioned above. For that group, I'd recommend either Axis &amp; Allies 1941 as an excellent jumping-in point or the Anniversary Edition for a great all-day wargaming affair. Regardless, while G.I. Joe: Battle for the Arctic Circle may not be for me, I appreciate the value it offers new and younger players to get their first taste of this series.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-the-removal-of-a-private-doctor-sparked-a-union-at-the-developer-of-candy-crush<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In early 2024, Activision Blizzard under its new owner Microsoft sent an email around to employees at its Stockholm office letting them know that one of their most popular company benefits was going away. And in doing so, the company inadvertently sparked a union effort.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has learned that last fall, over one hundred employees at mobile game maker King’s Stockholm location formed a union club with Unionen, Sweden’s largest trade union. The group has since been acknowledged and is in communication with company management in the hopes of eventually securing a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) that will govern their work environment, policies, and benefits going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unions in Sweden are a bit different from the ones those in the U.S. may be familiar with. In Sweden, eligible workers can join a trade union representing the type of work they do at any time, regardless of whether or not their individual company has organized. As a result, roughly 70% of the country is involved in a trade union (per data shared by Unionen), and the country has a long history of laws more friendly to unions than in many other countries. Trade unions negotiate broadly with their respective sectors over working conditions such as salaries and sick leave, and individual membership in a trade union can confer some small, extra benefits to employees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s another layer to union membership in Sweden, which is forming a union club and securing a CBA. If enough employees join the same union at a company, they can vote to install a union board to negotiate a CBA on their behalf. That CBA can secure them additional workplace-specific benefits similar to U.S. union contracts, and local union boards can even receive representation at the top levels of company management and a voice in major company decisions. This is what has happened at King Stockholm, following a growing games industry trend already seen at Swedish gaming companies such as <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/paradox-interactive-to-sign-collective-bargaining-agreement-with-labor-unions" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Paradox Interactive</u></a> and, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/over-100-developers-of-just-cause-contraband-at-avalanche-studios-have-unionized"><u>more recently, Avalanche Studios</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The doctor is out</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I spoke with Kajsa Sima Falck, an engineering manager at King in Stockholm and a board member of King Stockholm’s Unionen chapter. Falck explained to me that prior to 2024, union talk at the company was relatively quiet. There was a channel in the company Slack dedicated to union discussion for the small handful of union members, but it mostly went unused. She recalls it having only around nine or ten members.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But then, in early January, employees of Activision Blizzard in Stockholm received an email from management with some devastating news. Falck explains that during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Stockholm office had been granted an unusual benefit: a free, private doctor for themselves and their families. The doctor, rumored to have been hand-picked by then-CEO Bobby Kotick, quickly became extremely popular among the staff. She was good at her job, Falck said, quick to respond to phone calls and emails, instrumental in supporting them during the pandemic, and empathetic toward employees’ requests for sick leave or mental health notes. Over time, much of the staff came to rely on her for all their healthcare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is why it was so devastating when employees were told, not long after Activision Blizzard was acquired by Microsoft, that this benefit was being taken away. What’s more, employees were only given a week’s notice as to the end of this benefit, meaning individuals and families suddenly had to scramble to find a new doctor and new healthcare options.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/15/welcome-to-our-new-stockholm-kingdom-1-1736961303607.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">King's office in Stockholm, Sweden.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Employees were offered private health insurance benefits effectively to replace the doctor, but Falck noted that the replacement benefits aren't as good as what they had before. “You have to go through a portal and you have to talk to a nurse every time you want to get an appointment for something,” she says. “So it's not that personal experience of having a doctor, like a proper person that cares for you, and wants the best for you, and puts you on sick leave if you're feeling burnt out. She [the private doctor] was a godsend.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Falck tells me that normally, employees of King Stockholm were fairly quiet about company issues or complaints. But not this time. It seemed like <em>everyone</em> was talking about this, with a number of posts about the change popping up in the Stockholm general Slack channel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We had no bargaining power,” she says. “I mean, if we had a CBA in place, we could have had a chance to try to negotiate and talk to our employer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With no recourse available, Falck suggested spinning the union Slack channel back up, and suddenly the channel was flooded with interest, eventually reaching 217 members by the time I spoke to her. Over the next several months, the newly-energized group made plans and contacted representatives at Unionen. And in October of 2024, the group officially voted to form a union club with a union board at King Stockholm. [IGN reached out to Microsoft and Activision Blizzard King for comment for this piece, but did not receive a response.]</p><h2 data-cy="title2">No gods, only King</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Since its official formation, the King union has met with Activision Blizzard HR a few times to discuss how the two groups will communicate going forward, and Falck says their response has been “neutral.” This was to be expected, given the legal protections for unions in Sweden. But Microsoft has also publicly committed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-agrees-neutral-approach-future-activision-blizzard-unions"><u>taking a “neutral approach” toward unions</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-entire-development-team-has-officially-unionized"><u>reports from other</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-qa-workers-vote-to-form-largest-us-video-game-worker-union-to-date"><u>newly-formed unions</u></a> within the company seem to indicate it’s following through with that globally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Falck says she and the other union members are clear-eyed about the fact that it’s too late to get their private doctor benefit back, much less the same beloved doctor that was so popular among staff. But she says it is an expectation that they will eventually bargain with the company to obtain a CBA that will protect other popular benefits from being pulled out from under them in the same way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it comes down to being able to protect the [benefits] that we have with agreements to make sure that they don't do changes without us having influence and being able to negotiate changes,” she says. “That's where everyone was at when this benefit was taken away, because we have some benefits that are kind of unique. They're not super unique to the game industry, but they're quite unique as a whole to companies in Sweden. Like we have a bonus, we have all these things like benefits from Microsoft that are quite good. So we want to make sure we get those protected so if things are going to change, we can at least try to fight that or get it somewhat bulletproof for the future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other important issues Falck mentions may come up are salary and information transparency at the company, as well as protection and transparency around company reorganizations and, critically, layoffs. But most importantly for Falck and her colleagues is the ability to influence their workplace for the good of everyone. As Unionen Stockholm organizer Timo Rybak explains:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The whole idea of unionizing in Sweden is based on the fact of both parties having influence and getting to the table to discuss matters,” he says. “It's employees helping their employer have knowledge of the everyday work, which is entirely unavailable to any company president, or any HR representative for that matter, [who are] not a game developer [and don’t] do the daily work of every single employee. That's just impossible. So giving all of those people a say and a seat at the table, well, that's just a positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Labor law in Sweden is still skewed towards the employer, their rights are greater than those of employees. But of course, what rights you do have as an employee, you should be protecting and be aware of and that kind of ties into the fact that unionizing is also a way of learning your rights, and especially in an industry like game development or IT at large, which has a very large community of immigrant workers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Falck points out that the union has already seen the benefits of simply sharing information on employee rights, saying that a large number of European and American game developers have come to work at King over the years and don’t necessarily understand what they’re entitled to. Organizing has enabled them to share information and educate one another on their rights as employees to better enable them to advocate for themselves individually, and as a group.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Falck and her colleagues, forming a union club at King may have started as a backlash to an unpopular change. But its purpose is ultimately to protect the things they love about a job they care deeply about. “It's just a completely different world and a different company that we're getting used to. So we want to protect what is King, what is the culture, what are the benefits.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
