            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">And 32% own a Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you bought a Nintendo Switch 2 in June, the odds are good you also bought Mario Kart World. In fact, according to Circana, 82% of Nintendo Switch 2 purchasers also picked up Mario Kart World.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That comes from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-the-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-in-us-history">Circana's June report</a>, which shared that the Nintendo Switch 2 is officially the fastest-selling video game console in the U.S. In total, the Nintendo Switch sold 1.6 million units in the U.S. in June, beating out the PlayStation 4's previous record of 1.1 million units in November of 2012.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of those 1.6 million unit sales, 82% either purchased the Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle, or bought the game standalone. This helped propel Mario Kart World to become the third best-selling game of the month in Circana's rankings, though it's possible it could have ranked even higher due to the exclusion of Nintendo's digital data from the sales charts.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-switch-becomes-fastest-selling-system-in-nintendo-history" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As a comparison point</a>, when the Nintendo Switch 1 launched, over 100% of new console owners that month also purchased its launch game, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, worldwide. Yes, the game sold more copies on Switch than Nintendo did Switch systems. "This may be attributed to people who purchased both a limited edition of the game to collect and a second version to play," Nintendo suggested at the time. So Mario Kart World isn't quite beating those numbers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it may also be doing even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-console-in-uk-history-but-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-launches-were-bigger">better in other countries</a>. According to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-now-allegedly-frances-fastest-selling-console-ever-with-over-200k-sold-so-far/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report from Wccftech</a>, the game's Switch 2 attach rate in France was over 95%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, we learned from Circana this morning that 32% of Nintendo Switch 2 purchasers in June also bought a Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, helping make it the best-selling accessory of the month in the U.S. by dollar sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unshockingly, one of the reasons people are buying Mario Kart World is because it's pretty dang good. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">gave the game an 8/10</a>, saying that it "may not make the most convincing case that going open-world was the boost the series needed, but excellent multiplayer racing, incredible polish, and the thrilling new Knockout Tour mode still more than live up to its legacy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
