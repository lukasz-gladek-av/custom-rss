            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Finally, a AAA game that'll run on most gaming PCs</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> is just a couple of weeks away, and while the first few trailers definitely made it look like a <em>beautiful</em> game, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> trailer that debuted earlier this week, well, didn't. But, the way I see it, that's <em>excellent </em>news, especially for anyone on a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-budget-gaming-pc">budget gaming PC</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since the RE Engine came to prominence starting with Resident Evil: Biohazard, Capcom has been impressing me with just how good it can make games look, without making them too demanding. Now, obviously, I haven't had the chance to test Resident Evil: Requiem performance yet myself, but just looking at both the system requirements and the Switch 2 trailer, it seems like Capcom is continuing this trend. </p><div><div><p>Resident Evil: Requiem Minimum PC Requirements</p></div><div><div><p>Processor</p><p>intel Core i5-8500 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</p></div><div><p>GPU</p><p>Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT</p></div></div></div><div><div><p>Resident Evil: Requiem Recommended PC System requirements</p></div><div><div><p>Processor</p><p>Intel Core i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 5500</p></div><div><p>GPU</p><p>Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super / AMD Radeon RX 6600</p></div></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom hasn't revealed what resolution and settings either of these spec sheets are targeting, but even if that recommended build is just for 1080p Ultra at 60 fps, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/02/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2060-super-review-and-benchmarks">Nvidia RTX 2060 Super</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review">Radeon RX 6600</a> are very attainable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-graphics-card">graphics cards.</a> That's not to mention only requiring a Core i7-8700 or Ryzen 5 5500 and 16GB of RAM, which is a very low bar to clear. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">What Kind of Performance Can I Expect?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, because Capcom hasn't revealed any specific settings that the system requirements are targeting, I can't say for sure, but from my time testing <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/resident-evil-village-pc-performance-the-almost-perfect-pc-port-we-all-needed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resident Evil Village for TechRadar</a> when it came out, I was able to get nearly 60 fps at 4K with an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/evga-rtx-3060-xc-black-review">RTX 3060</a> – and the 3060 is very much not a 4K graphics card. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, it's important to note that the requirements for Requiem are a bit heavier than they were for Village. The biggest difference is that instead of asking for a Radeon RX 5700 or a GTX 1070 for Village, Requiem is asking for an RTX 2060 Super or a Radeon RX 6600. And while the performance gap between these graphics cards isn't huge on its own, the key difference is that Requiem is recommending a ray tracing-capable GPU – Village didn't. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">That makes a lot of sense, given the visual quality of some of the trailers that have come out for the game, but it may leave some folks with older GPUs out in the cold. It's very likely that with an older non-RT GPU, the game will look a lot like the Nintendo Switch 2 footage. The bright side here, though, is that the GTX 1660 and Radeon RX 5500 XT sneak in the minimum specs, so you'll still be able to <em>play</em> the game, it just might not look too great. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Nintendo Switch 2 Equivalent</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's important to highlight that the Nintendo Switch 2 is able to run Resident Evil: Requiem, even if it wouldn't <em>quite</em> meet the system requirements if it were a PC. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tech-analysis-is-4k-actually-realistic-updated">The Tegra T239 SoC in the handheld is roughly the equivalent of a mobile RTX 3050</a> – which is weaker than the desktop-class GTX 1660 Capcom is requiring. I wouldn't get too caught up in this detail, though. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Primarily, that's because the Nintendo Switch 2 is a console and every single unit will be running the exact same hardware. That means when Capcom was porting Resident Evil: Requiem over to the Switch 2, it was able to fine-tune the build to the exact hardware, likely finding optimizations that wouldn't be there for the PC version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, just going by the Switch 2 trailer earlier this week, it does seem like Capcom just barely managed to squeeze the game onto the handheld. But even if it is rough, I'm looking forward to seeing just how well it runs on the Nintendo console. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.

In the interview, Horii is asked directly about the decision to recast certain characters in Kiwami from their original Japanese actors. His general response as to why he recast both Hamazaki and Rikiya Shimabukuro is that while it would "certainly be safer not to recast them and avoid online criticism," the studio "felt there was no use being afraid."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Horii goes on to say that they based their decision on who they most wanted to see perform. When asked directly about Kagawa playing Hamazaki, this is what Horii had to say:</p><blockquote>Hamazaki is a sleazy, persistent, and militant yakuza, right? Since he isn't an explosive character like Kanda, when we tried to think of someone who makes you go, "This guy's a creep," naturally it was Kagawa – that was the main factor. Kagawa's acting is fun to watch. Even when he's chopping a pig's feet off with a chef's knife, it has a slimy feel. That feeling permeates his performance, so it brings a freshness to the scene and made it feel really fun.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Kagawa's casting as Hamazaki has been met with anger from Yakuza fans due to the actor having been <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/actor-teruyuki-kagawa-accused-of-sexual-harassment-tied-the-knot-in-2022" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused by multiple women</a> of <a href="https://www.dailyshincho.jp/article/2022/12271701/?all=1&amp;page=2#google_vignette" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sexual assault</a>, with one woman coming forward with what seems to be photographic evidence of the incident. In 2022, Kagawa <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/08/26/national/teruyuki-kagawa-groping-apology/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted to and apologized</a> for one of the incidents, but another of his accusers has <a href="https://www.dailyshincho.jp/article/2022/12271701/?all=1&amp;page=2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said she received no apology</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the announcement of Kagawa's casting, Yakuza fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1ns20eq/they_need_to_remove_kagawa_from_this_game/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reacted in anger on social media</a>, getting #REMOVEKAGAWA trending on multiple networks and creating a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/remove-teruyuki-kagawa-from-his-role-as-goh-hamazaki-in-yakuza-kiwami-3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Change.org petition</a> that at the time of this writing has nearly 10,000 signatures. Fans have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1o0j7l7/rgg_studio_suppressing_removekagawa_on_instagram/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused RGG Studio</a> of suppressing the #REMOVEKAGAWA hashtag and deleting comments referencing the issue on its official Instagram page. And a number of them have pointed out that Sega has recast actors for offenses in the past - Pierre Taki was recast in Judgment back in 2019 after he was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/16/18409777/yakuza-judgment-new-actor-pierre-taki/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arrested for cocaine possesssion</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Up to this point, neither RGG Studio nor Sega has offered official comment on Kagawa's casting, nor the accusations - Horii's answer is the first statement that's been offered on the subject. However, Sega did <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?si=lJmH7GkM8lqeVkMR&amp;v=37mtmF0FrPI&amp;feature=youtu.be" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publish a trailer on its official YouTube</a> after the wave of criticism, which introduced the Japanese voice cast and opened on a longer clip of Hamazaki. IGN reached out to Sega for additional comment ahead of this story, but did not hear back in time for publication.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
