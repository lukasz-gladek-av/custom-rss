Happily, and perhaps unsurprisingly, players were able to stop the station's deadly space laser from obliterating the game's map — although not without causing a bit of damage in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As destruction rained down, the event's closing moments saw Superman arrive — presumably to try and help with clean up duties during the game's incoming superhero-themed season, which begins in just a few hours' time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite's big Star Wars event began in orbit around the game's battle royale Island, giving players a rare glimpse at the game's setting from outside its usual boundaries. Fortnite's setting exists as a bubble of reality floating through the multiverse (which handily allows any character from any franchise to turn up at any time!) and here, players were able to pilot X-Wings and TIE-Fighters to blow up orbiting Star Destroyers and engage in fun dogfights. In the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes">continued absence of a Star Wars: Battlefront 3</a>, this was a fun riff on its space battles to get things started.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The action then swiftly moved to within the Death Star itself, as Fortnite heroes Jonesy (Troy Baker) and Hope (Suzie Yeung) led players through the bowels of the station, initially disguised as Stormtroopers and their captives. Ultimately, players found themselves in an encounter with Star Wars' Emperor (was that the voice of Sheev Palpatine himself, Ian McDiarmid?), and able to escape the Death Star as it exploded.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/07/0defa510-26bf-45aa-835e-6c50e905e524-1-1749324031249.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Star Wars: Battlefront eat your heart out.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a nod to Fortnite's 2021 live event Operation Sky Fire (which also ended in a space station exploding above the game's Island), players were initially left to celebrate their victory — until the realisation that huge flaming chunks of said space station were now raining down on their battle royale home. And here, one of these chunks smashed straight into the glowing Rift Gate used to access the spirit realm by Fortnite's current antihero Daigo, unleashing its untold power. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event's final moments see players back on the Island, mysterious energy now crackling around them. (Will this be the explanation for why superpowers now exist in the next battle royale season? Quite possibly.) Meanwhile, Superman is seen watching the Island from afar, as it is flooded by spirit realm energy. The suggestion here, of course, is that Superman will be swooping in to help.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/07/696-fortnite-death-star-sabotage-full-event-experience-00-14-22-1749324356071.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Superman watches as Fortnite's battle royale Island erupts in spirit realm energy.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite will, for the first time, follow up a major live event with a new season launch on the same day. Following the conclusion of Death Star Sabotage, Fortnite is currently in downtime, but will return with Chapter 6: Season 3 in just a few hours' time. As you might expect from Superman's arrival, this next season will indeed be superhero themed — and as eagle-eyed players have noticed, this is indeed the new version played by David Corenswet from James Gunn's upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/superman-2025">Superman</a> movie. That's some well-timed brand synergy!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While highly anticiapated, Fortnite's Star Wars season saw some of the game's lowest player numbers in some time — perhaps in response to its daring decision to remove all regular weapons (and all ammo!) and fully commit to a five-week period of Star Wars gunplay. It will be interesting to see how player numbers rebound with the launch of this new season later today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Fortnite developer Epic Games announced it would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ai-darth-vader-was-the-beginning-epic-reveals-plans-to-let-people-create-their-own-ai-npcs-in-fortnite">making Star Wars in-game assets available to creators to build their own experiences in a galaxy far, far away</a> in the not too far off future. While enjoyable, tonight's live event did feel at some points like something of a showcase for that, while including a few morsels for fans of the game's ongoing narrative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Want to watch the whole of Fortnite's Death Star Sabotage for yourself?
