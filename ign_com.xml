            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-classic-announced-new-mode-2016-release-blizzard<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch 2 is taking a page from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/14/world-of-warcraft-classic-preview">WoW Classic</a> and returning to the beginning, announcing a brand-new Overwatch Classic mode featuring the original 21 heroes and 12 maps from the 2016 release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The nostalgia mode, which launches Tuesday and continues over the course of three weeks, will feature key moments from Overwatch history, Blizzard says. It'll begin with the original 1.0 version from launch, with no limits on which characters you can pick, meaning you can theoretically have a team full of tanks or Torbjörns. And yes, it will be 6v6, though Blizzard says it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-is-looking-at-bringing-6v6-back-to-overwatch-but-it-wont-be-easy">unrelated to its experiments with bringing the format back to Overwatch 2</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Overwatch Classic is separate from our broader 6v6 plans. Overwatch Classic is meant to be a nostalgic experience, taking heroes, players, and the game back to moments in the game’s history for limited time events," Blizzard explains in its official <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/a-blast-to-the-past-begins-with-overwatch-classic/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ </a>about the event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch Classic's gameplay will largely match up with the original game's mechanics, with characters regaining their original abilities and Ultimates charging up much more quickly. However, maps like Dorado, Numbani, Route 66, and Watchpoint: Gibraltar will retain their changes from Overwatch 2, including match timing and how elevator platforms work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the event progresses, Blizzard plans to progressively layer in changes, including single hero limits. Future updates will return to "popular moments in the game's history," with Blizzard citing the 2017 Moth Meta — in which Mercy was one of the most powerful characters — and the triple-tank, triple-support style of "Goats" as two examples. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/11/overwatch-2-classic-1731353883370.jfif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The first part of Overwatch Classic will let players choose any character they want with no restrictions. Image source: Blizzard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans for their part have been generally positive about the news. Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1gox6jy/classic_overwatch_trailer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>, one player joked, "Mass rez is back, I'm scared mom come get me." Others are asking for it to be a permanent arcade game mode, though Blizzard is being cagey about its plans for the future, saying it plans to measure player response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch Classic officially commences on November 12 and will continue until December 2. It'll be playable as a mode within the standard Overwatch 2 client, and will not include legacy features like loot boxes, the original UI, or the Competitive mode. Available modes include Assault, Escort, Hybrid, and Control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

This is an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">excellent TV to pair up with your PlayStation 5</a> or Xbox Series X. In fact, some critics rate the S90C as a better <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">gaming TV</a> than the LG C4. <a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/samsung/s90c-oled" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RTINGS</a> writes that "the LG (C4) is noticeably dimmer in Game Mode while the Samsung (S90C) isn't, making the Samsung the better choice for gamers."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Note</strong>: The best vendor to get this TV from is <a href="https://howl.link/icf9u7qwlfi6q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a> because you get a bonus $50 Best Buy gift card.

The S90C uses Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">OLED technology aside, the Samsung S90C also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz (rare in a 2023 TV) as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-high-end-4k-tv">running 4K</a> at 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. The S90C also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode. This is an especially good complement to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-pro-review">Playstation 5 Pro</a> console that was just released.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Should You Buy Now or Wait for Black Friday?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Although this is an extremely good discount for one of our favorite gaming TVs, you may be wondering if you should wait until Black Friday to make a purchase. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday 2024</a> will definitely have more options available, but if you're looking for a 65" OLED TV, this is an outstanding deal and we doubt you'll find anything better. It's the<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-deals-labor-day-2024-sales"> best TV deal right now</a> and I bet it will be one of the best TV deals for Black Friday as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
