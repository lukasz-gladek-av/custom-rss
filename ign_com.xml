In light of that, Capcom is ensuring players know it will take action against cheaters engaging in any sort of fraudulent activity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post from the Monster Hunter account on <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1907436493712298216" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>, Capcom issued the stark warning: "To ensure a fun and fair experience for our players, we will take action against accounts participating in fraudulent ranking activity, such as the use of cheating or external tools. Accounts deemed to be in breach of this may be suspended, or have restrictions placed on them, such as being unable to receive rewards from these quests."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not cheating is one thing, but Capcom also warned that players participating in multiplayer hunts with cheaters could also result in an invalid quest completion time and the "right to rewards" revoked for everyone in the party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Please take caution to avoid playing multiplayer with those who are engaging in prohibited activity, or those you suspect of such," Capcom said. The company encouraged players who find themselves in a quest where fraudulent activity is taking place to report the cheaters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These quests will ultimately <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/topics/arena-quests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offer some neat rewards</a> in the form of cosmetic pendants. Some will be doled out to all participants, and others are granted based on Completion Time or the hunter's ranking. So it makes sense that Capcom is cracking down a bit harder on potential cheaters and suspect behavior, if it could result in issues with rewards and completion times.</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Time-Based Competition Quests go live with Title Update 1, and will all be organized through the new Arena Quest Counter in the Grand Hub in Suja.
