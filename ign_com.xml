            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-raider-class-hands-on-impressions-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the great things about Elden Ring has always been the diversity of playstyles it enables, and one of my favorite playstyles is loading up on Strength, grabbing the largest weapon I can find, and crushing foes with posture-breaking jumping attacks and charged-up heavy strikes. If that’s you too, then allow me to introduce you to the Raider in Nightreign (see the video below).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Guardian — the other big burly class with lots of health and an affinity for big weapons — is more focused on defense with a shield as a starter weapon and an ultimate ability that can mitigate damage for the entire party for an extended period of time, the Raider is designed as an absolute offensive powerhouse. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The most important ability of the Raider is Retaliate, which initially may not seem like a very strong skill on its own — it’s just two stomps that deal a bit of physical and poise damage. But the real magic is that thanks to the Raider’s passive, he cannot be knocked down while doing Retaliate. This means that the Raider basically has a free damage-soaking technique that will let you totally armor through pretty much any enemy or boss attack, with the added bonus of that weak second stomp getting replaced by an extremely powerful punch that will stagger even the largest enemies, if you manage to absorb an attack that would’ve done a substantial amount of damage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there is the Raider’s ultimate, Totem Stela, which has him slamming the ground and causing a large totem to erupt, dealing big damage to anything around it. Like all of the other Ultimates in Nightreign, this is an incredibly powerful technique that can alter the tide of a fight. Not only does it deal big damage, but the totem is climbable, giving both you and your teammates either a safe place to lay low, or a vantage point to hit. In addition to that, it <em>also </em>gives everyone a damage buff as well, meaning it's one of the first ults you’ll want to coordinate using so that the rest of the team can benefit from it. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Of all the classes I've played in Nightreign, the raider was the one I had the most fun with.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Raider starts with the Raider’s Greavtaxe, which is a pretty solid starting weapon that deals some fire damage and has the “Endure” skill affixed to it, which basically gives you another way to absorb and power through enemy attacks in case Retaliate is on cooldown. Still, you’ll definitely want to find a better weapon as the nights get closer, and large strength-scaling weapons are definitely the Raider’s go-to style of weapon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all the classes I’ve played in Nightreign, the Raider is definitely the one that I’ve had the most fun with. It’s the one that is most well-suited for one-on-one battles, which is appropriate because its Remembrances (we’ll talk about those later on in the month) have you fighting in one-on-one boss fights in a sort of gladiatorial arena, which is a nice change of pace. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's all for our hands-on impressions of Nightreign's classes, but stay tuned all throughout the month in depth looks at the mechanics of Nightreign, along with interviews with the developers, and more as IGN First continues on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

Through its ever-evolving combat and the introduction of beloved character bonding mechanics, the series has ascended to the upper echelon of tactical RPGs, culminating in two excellent mainline entries on the Nintendo Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we near the end of the original Switch era, we’ve compiled a list of every Fire Emblem game available on the console as well as what's coming to the Switch 2. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">How Many Fire Emblem Games Are on Switch?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>There are five Fire Emblem games on Switch: </strong>two mainline games and three spinoffs.

The mashup incorporates the best elements of each series, blending Fire Emblem’s team-based strategy with Dynasty Warriors’ button-mashing, hack-and-slash action. It’s a worthwhile spinoff for action fans, though the light story makes it inessential to those concerned with Fire Emblem lore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game was developed by Dynasty Warriors studio Omega Force in collaboration with the action gurus at Team Ninja (Ninja Gaiden, Nioh).</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Fire Emblem: Three Houses (2019)</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/fe-three-houses-1745882956790.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/25/fire-emblem-three-houses-review"><u>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</u></a> was a milestone release for the series. It was the first Fire Emblem game released on a home console in 12 years, the first mainline entry released on Switch, and a critical and commercial success that carried forward the momentum of Awakening seven years before it.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Three Houses is a massive tactical RPG that balances the grand with the intimate. Large-scale battles progress an overarching story of politics and religion within a continental war, while quieter moments between battles are spent in the monastery training, teaching, exploring, and bonding with other characters through well-written and -acted conversations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Three Houses is Fire Emblem at its best, and what we'd recommend as a starting point if you’re looking to jump into the series on Switch.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore (2020)</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/tokyo-mirage-1745882991839.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2020, Nintendo released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review"><u>Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE</u></a> Encore, an expanded port of the original Wii U release. Encore added new story content, characters, and music to the Nintendo-Atlus crossover game, which blends Fire Emblem’s “weapon triangle” combat mechanic — swords have an advantage over axes, axes over lances, lances over swords — with the flashy style, dungeon-crawling, and moment-to-moment combat of Atlus’s Shin Megami Tensei and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">Persona games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story is a comical, often over-the-top send-up of Japanese pop-culture that, as in Warriors before it, takes a backseat to the action.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes (2023)</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/fe-warriors-three-hopes-1745883001863.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo re-teamed with Omega Force for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fire-emblem-warriors-three-hopes-review"><u>Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes</u></a>, the companies’ second Fire Emblem-Dynasty Warriors crossover following Fire Emblem Warriors. Three Hopes is a retelling of Three Houses set in an alternate timeline where Three Houses’ protagonist Byleth serves as the main villain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Three Hopes is a more robust blend of the two franchises than its predecessor, integrating more of Fire Emblem’s social and tactical mechanics with Dynasty Warriors’ fast-paced action.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Fire Emblem Engage (2023)</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/fe-engage-1745883011216.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fire-emblem-engage-review"><u>Fire Emblem Engage</u></a> is the series’ latest game and its second mainline entry on Switch. Engage is a progression of Three Houses’ excellence and an ode to Fire Emblem's past: It refines and scales down the social and hub mechanics of Three Houses while shifting its primary focus to the series’ longstanding tactical combat, most notably reintroducing Fire Emblem’s “weapon triangle" system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story of Engage follows a Divine Dragon named Alear, who’s tasked with collecting 12 rings to defeat the Fell Dragon and save the continent of Elyos. Engage’s original story connects to the series past through these 12 rings, each of which houses the spirit of a past Fire Emblem protagonist, allowing you to summon past heroes such as Marth, Ike, Celica, and Byleth.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fire Emblem Games Available With Nintendo Switch Online</h2><div catalogid="f103691f-4710-4305-8c12-09ba36a36696" id="187637"><div id="187637" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack: 12-Month Individual Membership</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are currently two Fire Emblem games available with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-nintendo-switch-online-cost">Nintendo Switch Online subscription</a> outside of Japan: the 2003 Game Boy Advance game Fire Emblem, aka Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, and the 2004 follow-up Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A third game, 2005's Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, will be added to the catalog when GameCube games are integrated into the service alongside the launch of Switch 2 on June 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the complete list of Fire Emblem games currently available with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/06/fire-emblem-2"><u>Fire Emblem</u></a> (GBA, 2003)</li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/05/24/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones"><u>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</u></a> (GBA, 2004)</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Upcoming Fire Emblem Games on Switch and Switch 2</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no official word on new Fire Emblem games in development, but it's pretty likely we'll see something new (or remade) in the series on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide">upcoming Switch 2</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/eve-vanguard-makes-a-lot-of-big-promises-but-delivers-good-gunplay.1183326/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/eve-vanguard-makes-a-lot-of-big-promises-but-delivers-good-gunplay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's almost surreal to ride a drop pod down to the surface of one of EVE Online's tens of thousands of planets in the upcoming shooter tie-in, EVE Vanguard. I've flown by them hundreds of times in the many years I've been playing the venerable spaceship MMO, but usually at astronomical distances. I always wondered about what was going on down there. I would make up stories about it in my head. Now I have a high-powered space rifle in my hands and I'm experiencing the universe up close and personal. And while it was a very, very build that couldn't show off a lot of the bigger promises, to my disappointment, there are some promising hints already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a quick caveat, the footage you're seeing is still from an early build and a lot of things, including the weapon and enemy models, are not final. CCP just announced that Vanguard will be going into Early Access in Summer 2026, so we've still got a while to wait. Also, the portion we actually got to play was only the session-based shooter maps themselves, and not the career and progression stuff that will be taking place back in space. But I got to talk to the devs about both, so we'll get into a bit of each here.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">EVE Vanguard – First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What, exactly, is a Vanguard? Well, like most things in EVE Online, it's some esoteric high concept sci-fi that can seem a little bewildering at first. Your character is a semi-immortal "infomorph" – which is to say a digital human consciousness that lives in cyberspace. I guess you could say you're something like Johnny Silverhand from Cyberpunk 2077. To fight on the front lines of New Eden's many wars, you upload yourself into a powerful war clone, which is purpose-grown from a fresh soup of biological matter for each mission. They're not free, but you can call down a new one in the middle of a mission if the one you're in gets blown up, explaining how you can respawn over and over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a scale from random cannon fodder to Master Chief, the devs said you can think of war clones as not exactly superhuman, but more like the absolute peak of human ability an elite athlete could achieve. They are renowned across the galaxy, and running into another player-controlled Vanguard on a deployment is meant to feel like a mini boss fight.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Suit Up</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Vanguards gather in bastions, which CCP says you could think of almost like The Continental from John Wick. I swear I'm not trying to shoehorn in more Keanu references here. It just happens! It's neutral ground to shop, swap stories, and pick up new contracts, represented by a virtual space where you'll be able to physically walk around and interact with other mercs' avatars. As someone who was devastated when EVE Online removed the ability to walk around in stations, I was particularly pleased to hear this.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The really cool thing, though, is that these bastions exist out in the same universe where EVE Online players are zipping around in their spaceships. The initial ones will be NPC-controlled, but it will eventually be possible for players to attack, build, and even own their own bastions. CCP hopes specific bastions might develop a reputation as the place you go if you really need a job done right. And similar to how EVE has "high sec" space where NPC law enforcement protects new players and "low" or "null sec" where players are free to PvP to their heart's content, new Vanguards will also be able to choose where they end up based on how interested they are in fighting other players.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hair Trigger</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest changes in philosophy EVE Vanguard has undergone since its reveal back in 2023 is how the guns themselves are being designed. We're moving away from sleek, understated military sci-fi into what the designers called an homage to the "golden age" of shooters, citing inspirations like Doom, Quake, and Unreal. There is still your standard space rifle, which comes in a few different faction variants. But I also got to play around with an energy shotgun with ricocheting projectiles that can fire in a spread pattern, or a single, massive orb of destruction if you hold down the fire button for a couple seconds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As more of a long-range enjoyer, my favorite was this high-powered sniper rifle that features the ability to hold your breath to line up a perfect shot. While the model is clearly unfinished, the reload animation of swapping out the little focusing crystal is slick and memorable as well. Like in EVE Online, almost everything is gathered and crafted by players, too. Even in a mission, I had to loot some corpses and spend a bit of time with my portable fabricator to top up my ammo. Mining and industry will also be a part of the Vanguard experience. It will even be possible to specialize in it – though the devs warned me that you'll probably want to bring some backup with combat skills if you do.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>For now, EVE Vanguard is still a lot of "wills," "shoulds," and " hope tos." It is playable, and the gunplay feels a bit unpolished still, but satisfying. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You might see me switching weapons with a debug menu in the video at the top of the page, which was just for the demo. Eventually, we'll be picking our loadout from the deck of our own battlebarge ahead of a deployment. This will also let us pick which kind of war clone to spawn, and we were told they will eventually come in all different shapes and sizes for different specializations. Vanguard will also have a bit of separation from the main EVE Online economy. Notably, you don't buy guns and ammo with ISK, which is the main currency for the starship jockeys, since it wouldn't make much sense for a rifle to cost the same as a frigate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There absolutely will be ways for players of both games to work together and benefit one another symbiotically, though. Some materials Vanguards can access planetside might not be abundant in space, for instance. Another example I was given likened it to Star Wars: Rogue One or Return of the Jedi, where an elite ground team might have to take down a shield generator so the fleet above can attack a fortified station.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nightmare Fuel</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The enemies here are also a work-in-progress. Using placeholder models, they spawn in small groups and mostly keep their distance, but I did get caught a couple times by a flanking attack from an unexpected direction. We got to see some concept art of one of the PvE enemy factions, Mordu's Legion, though, and they are extremely unsettling. These cyborg space mercs who have their heart ritually removed as part of their initiation will come in several different ranks, with some being able to direct the others on the battlefield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On any given deployment, you might end up running into these NPCs and other players. These arenas are massive, open-ended, and varied, a combination of procedurally-generated terrain and handcrafted battlegrounds featuring the wreckage of some of EVE's recognizable starships. In this mission, there was debris actively streaking through the atmosphere as we fought, which was a really awesome touch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, EVE Vanguard is still a lot of "wills," "shoulds," and " hope tos." It is playable, and the gunplay feels a bit unpolished still, but satisfying. The environments are impressive, and the weapon designs are diverse and bombastic. It's just hard to get the full picture without actually experiencing how it will tie into the EVE Online shared universe or the social features, which are definitely the most exciting part of the whole idea. For that we'll have to wait until the middle of next year when Early Access warps in, at which point both games will be connected at last.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a microtransactions system that has proved controversial, but a money-spinner for the developers, generating billions of dollars in revenue over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In most games of this type, the amount of money you have to spend to eventually pull a character is withheld from the player — and you can see why given the poor odds available. But now, HoYoverse has updated Genshin Impact to do just that, revealing front and centre just how much needs to be spent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Genshin Impact shop now tells U.S. players how many pulls you’re getting with each purchase (you can buy wishes directly with a direct conversion rate displayed) and how much you need to spend to guarantee pulling a character, which varies between $1.98 to $475.20. The figure is based on the base prices of the pulls (without bonuses) and if you hit the max pulls to guarantee the character (180 pulls).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, while the posted figure assumes the highest possible price if you intentionally don’t buy the higher value (and more expensive) bundles, you could face spending nearly $500 pulling just one character in Genshin Impact.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have reacted with a mix of disbelief and positivity at the transparency.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Whole thing is weirdly.... Transparent,” said redditor Zion-plex. “You see it clear as day, 100 bucks 50 pulls every time staring at you (whales think or maybe don't even care they ‘know’ the math). Man, that'll sting, even for those who can and will spend, there's a lot of mental suppression that goes on.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">”Unmitigated positive,” said Whilyam. “The only people helped by obscuring costs are the ones who want to take advantage of people or make it easier for people with addictions to justify spending money.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it’s harder to justify the spending with abysmal conversion rate visible with your eyes,” added Mtboomerang. “I think the biggest problem with addicts is they follow the emotion then they will calculate. With the conversion rate visible now, their logic will shut their emotion down in time before they are deep in emotion abyss trying to come up with a reason.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Good changes that should be standardized for all Gachas and other similar games with gambling/loot box type mechanics,” said mikethebest1.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some players are now calling on HoYoverse to just let Genshin Impact players buy characters directly, given they now know how much it could cost to obtain them through the gacha system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I wish they would just freaking sell the damn characters,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1kgml90/comment/mr0iwzu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said yuusharo</a>. “Horse armor works on me, I’d pay a freak ton on these games if I knew I’d get what I wanted every single time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Instead, the vast majority of their revenue comes from a tiny percentage of players exploiting gambling tendencies, preying on people like vultures. I hate it, I feel so gross whenever I succumb to that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why has HoYoverse added this layer of transparency to Genshin Impact now? It’s because it lost a court case against the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) back in January that resulted in a ban on selling loot boxes</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are wondering why, back in January <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2025/01/ftc-settlement-order-bans-sales-genshin-impact-loot-boxes-kids-under-16-without-their-parents" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HoYoverse reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</a> that resulted in increased transparency around parental consent and virtual currency practices within its games. The results are now kicking in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of this, <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155805" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HoYoverse is now required by U.S. law to age verify U.S. player accounts</a>. That's because as part of the FTC's settlement order, sales of Genshin Impact loot boxes to kids under 16 without their parents' consent were banned. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The age verification process will be rolled out to all U.S. players by May 20. If you don’t provide your age information by July 18, 2025, you could see your account suspended, the developer warned. If the verification is not completed by July 20, 2026, the personal information of your HoYoverse account will be deleted permanently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
