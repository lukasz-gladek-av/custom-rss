            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-may-find-it-hard-to-buy-all-of-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-financial-report-claims<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-confirms-sonys-buyout-intent-but-insists-no-decision-has-been-made-at-this-time">Sony’s pursuit of Kadokawa rumbles on</a>, financial experts have said the PlayStation maker may find it hard to buy the entirety of FromSoftware’s parent company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Japan’s <a href="https://toyokeizai.net/articles/-/842757" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toyo Keizai</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-cost-of-buying-out-kadokawa-entirely-could-discourage-sony-from-acquisition-deal-says-japanese-finance-outlet/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>) reported that Sony may be put off the deal due to the cost of having to acquire all of Kadokawa, rather than the parts it’s actually interested in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kadokawa is reportedly only interested in doing a deal with Sony if it buys the entire company. Sony, however, is reportedly only interested in “extracting” assets related to anime and video games, which presumably includes the developer of Elden Ring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buying all of Kadokawa would cost 640 billion yen (approx $4.3 billion), according to expert estimates. Sony’s cash for buyouts is apparently tight at the moment due to investments made elsewhere. As a point of comparison, Sony bought Destiny developer Bungie for $3.7 billion back in 2022. The studio has since suffered multiple rounds of layoffs and project cancelations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also the apparent prospect of a bidding war that would cause Kadokawa’s sale price to soar beyond Sony’s limit. The alternative is for Sony to buy 50% of Kadokawa and turn it into a subsidiary it doesn’t wholly own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kadokawa’s business extends into areas that fit into Sony’s broader entertainment offering, which includes anime, manga, TV, and film. Kadokawa is a prolific publisher of anime, and Sony already owns anime streamers Crunchyroll and Funimation. As well as FromSoftware, Kadokawa owns Danganronpa developer Spike Chunsoft, Octopath Traveler developer Acquire, and RPG Maker and Pixel Game Maker developer Gotcha Gotcha Games. Kadokawa is the majority owner of FromSoftware, with around 70% of the company. Sony already owns around 14% of the developer, with Tencent owning around 16%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Piers Harding-Rolls, Research Director at Ampere Analysis, told IGN that news of a potential deal isn’t that surprising. "Sony’s interest in Kadokawa’s games publisher FromSoftware was made more concrete in 2022 when it acquired a roughly 14% share of the company following up on its long-time collaboration with the company," Harding-Rolls said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At the time, Sony mentioned a broader interest in cross-media development of anime and games IP to support its other media businesses. So, in that sense any deal for the parent company Kadokawa, which also operates extensively in manga and anime, is a natural extension of this earlier deal. These other areas align nicely with Sony’s anime businesses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The market conditions for acquisitions have changed dramatically over the last two years but Sony will always be looking for opportunities that can fuel its growth and that bolster its IP portfolio, and that represent value. There may also be a defensive element to this move. FromSoftware is an important partner for Sony’s games business, and it will not want a competitor taking control of Kadokawa and potentially disrupting that relationship. It helps that Kadokawa is also active in areas which are a strong fit with Sony’s wider business."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Sony, its gaming business has already suffered significant layoffs this year and the closure of multiple studios, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-it-should-have-done-user-testing-and-internal-evaluation-earlier-on-concord"><u>Concord developer Firewalk</u></a>. In February, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-significant-playstation-layoffs-affecting-900-staff-london-studio-to-close"><u>it announced a round of layoffs</u></a> affecting 900 staff, or about 8% of its global PlayStation workforce. The layoffs impacted a number of PlayStation studios, including Insomniac, Naughty Dog, Guerrilla, and Firesprite, but PlayStation's London studio was hit hardest with a notice of closure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Yui Mok/PA Images via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

IGN has asked Tencent and Sony for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Tencent revealed a new seven-minute video showing more of Light of Motiram’s gameplay. After an intro that rekindles memories of Destiny’s famous Ghost ‘wake up, Guardian’ opening, we see gameplay that looks heavily inspired by the likes of Capcom’s Monster Hunter and Pocketpair’s Palworld, which itself was accused of “ripping off” Pokémon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Light of Motiram lets players befriend and raise various ‘mechanimals’ alone or with friends. You need to set up a base camp and ride tamed mechanimals as mounts, getting them to help with logging, farming, and crafting. Mechanimals can serve as ground, air, and water mounts, help in combat, and assist with resource gathering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tencent said Light of Motiram has hundreds of realistic survival gameplay mechanics. “Trees need to be carefully cut down else they deliver a swift death, a shelter has to be ventilated before lighting a fire so as not to choke, and lightning may strike (more than a few times) if you’re caught wearing metal in a storm,” the company said. “These realistic details can be used to players’ advantage, as for example lightning damage can electrocute fishes and make the process of fishing much easier and faster.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this sort of multiplayer survival gameplay is not featured in the Horizon games, the look and feel of Light of Motiram’s characters, monsters, and world are undeniably similar. Guerrilla is of course working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off"><u>a multiplayer, live service Horizon game</u></a> - Light of Motiram may be treading on its toes somewhat, although we’ll have to wait for a reveal to find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-micro-sd-cards-black-friday-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Increase your storage capabilities, for less.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-sd-cards-for-nintendo-switch">best micro SD card</a> for your Switch or Steam Deck this Black Friday? Then look no further, as these are truly the absolute best deals today. For <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yw6oO?object_uuid=92daa975-88aa-46b6-aef0-150399c2eafb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$55</a> you can get a perfect 1TB micro SD card, or for <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5bgXx?object_uuid=92daa975-88aa-46b6-aef0-150399c2eafb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$88.99</a> you can score one of our favorite 1.5TB micro SD cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My advice? Opt for the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yw6oO?object_uuid=92daa975-88aa-46b6-aef0-150399c2eafb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1TB card for just $55</a>, as that's an all-time low and one of the best deals I've ever seen for the Steam Deck. 1TB cards can go from upwards of $90+ even when on sale, so this is a rare opportunity to get a real Black Friday discount. Plus, if you're a Switch owner, there's a decent likelihood that the Switch 2 will run optimized for U3 A2 micro SD cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hitting these specs, you'll be able to get optimum performance on your current console, and whenever its successor finally launches. Futureproof yourself, and you'll be gaming happy all of next year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Choose the Best SD Card for Switch or Steam Deck</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">An SD card is essential for expanding your Switch or other device storage, but choosing the right one is key. Start with storage capacity: for casual gaming, 128GB might suffice, but larger titles like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (16GB) and screenshots can quickly fill it up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ensure compatibility by sticking to microSD formats—microSD, microSDHC, or microSDXC. Avoid SD or miniSD cards, as they won’t work with the Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, check transfer speed for smooth gameplay. Look for microSD cards with a speed class of 10 or higher, or UHS-1 for even better performance.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Switch Black Friday Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The final phase of Nintendo’s Black Friday sale is now live, and these are the best deals, which aren't getting any better! To be fair, they are mostly excellent as it is. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sale features feature discounts on popular Switch titles, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-black-friday-deal-2024">Sonic X Generations for $29.99</a>, Super Mario Odyssey for $29.99, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom for $44.99, and Balatro for $19.99.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Black Friday: Why Can You Trust IGN?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Why trust IGN for your shopping advice?
