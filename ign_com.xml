            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sleeping-dogs-movie-is-in-development-and-were-hearing-shang-chi-star-simu-liu-is-set-to-play-wei-shen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, Marvel Cinematic Universe star Simu Liu got Sleeping Dogs fans excited when he tweeted to say <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-star-simu-liu-says-hes-working-to-get-sleeping-dogs-a-film-adaptation">he was working with the rights holders to bring the much-loved video game to the big screen</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out things are a little further ahead than that. A source close to the project has told IGN that the Sleeping Dogs movie <em>is </em>in development, and we’re hearing Simu Liu, who plays Shang-Chi in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings">Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</a>, is producing and set to play the lead role of Wei Shen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Square Enix for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sleeping-dogs">Sleeping Dogs</a> was first released in 2012 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC and tells the story of detective Wei Shen as he infiltrates one of Hong Kong's notorious Triad crime syndicates. While it failed to meet publisher Square Enix's lofty sales expectations, it is much-loved by fans and sequel hopes have followed it ever since.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/01/sleeping-dogs-1738448345955.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sleeping Dogs is set for a wake-up call with a movie adaptation. Image credit: Square Enix.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/03/donnie-yen-to-star-in-sleeping-dogs-video-game-adaptation"><u>The original adaptation was announced in 2017</u></a> with Donnie Yen set to star, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/05/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-confirms-its-still-in-production"><u>the film disappeared a year later</u></a> and, just a few weeks ago, Yen himself confirmed it had been scrapped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work with these producers, and I even invested some of my own money into obtaining the drafts and some of the rights," Yen told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/action/506279/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-release-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I waited for years. Years. And I really want to do it. I have all these visions in my head, and unfortunately… I don’t know, you know how Hollywood goes, right? I spent many, many years on it. It was an unfortunate thing. Well, on to better things."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So when Liu tweeted to say he was working to make the Sleeping Dogs movie a reality, there was a degree of confusion among fans. Liu himself followed up with <a href="https://x.com/SimuLiu/status/1885252869483340236" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another statement</a> that added fuel to the fire, and even revealed his intention to help bring a Sleeping Dogs video game sequel to life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So few film projects make it from pitch phase to greenlight,” he said. “Pitching execs who don’t understand the game has been tiring. Everyone’s overwhelming love of Sleeping Dogs here has really given us life!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“First a movie, then a sequel game for everyone… that’s always been the dream.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: Who's Who in the Cast</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN can reveal that Story Kitchen is leading the Sleeping Dogs live action feature film project, with Square Enix the rights holder in question. Story Kitchen has form when it comes to video game adaptations, having worked on everything from the Sonic the Hedgehog films to Netflix’s animated Tomb Raider series. It’s currently working on the upcoming Streets of Rage adaptation and an adaptation of It Takes Two for Amazon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/just-cause-movie-announced-with-blue-beetle-director-at-the-helm">Story Kitchen announced a film adaptation of Square Enix's Just Cause</a>, with Blue Beetle director Ángel Manuel Soto signed on. IGN understands the Sleeping Dogs project has a writer and major filmmaker attached to the project, but there’s no release date or word on when production will begin just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The movie marks a significant revival for Sleeping Dogs, which saw its video game sequel canceled in late 2013 before it entered production, and its original developer, United Front Games, shut down three years later. Now, over a decade later, Sleeping Dogs could finally be set for a wake-up call.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

We bring you all the biggest news from the world of Xbox, as well as features, polls, talking points, reviews and so much more!</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many Xbox fans have been wondering whether one of the 'big three' Xbox franchises – <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/halo_infinite" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halo</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/gears_of_war_e-day" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gears</a> or <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/forza_motorsport" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forza</a> – would eventually make their way over to PS5. It turns out <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/forza_horizon_5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forza Horizon 5</a> is the first to make the jump, having been officially revealed for Sony's current-gen system with a Spring 2025 release window. Unsurprisingly, fans have been <em>very</em> opinionated about the announcement ever since it dropped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's even heartbreak over the decision to move such a treasured Xbox exclusive over to its rival console, but truthfully it's something we've been expecting for a while now. If you read between the lines, Phil Spencer and the team at Xbox have subtly tried to inform us about the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/11/xbox-boss-says-everything-is-on-the-table-when-it-comes-to-ps5-ports" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"no red lines"</a> rule when it comes to exclusives these days, which most likely means that Halo, Gears, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/starfield" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starfield</a> and many other Xbox franchises will be heading to PS5 and possibly even Nintendo Switch 2 sooner or later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But why do this? Why risk alienating loyal fans who have aligned themselves with the Xbox brand <em>because</em> of its exclusives? The answer almost certainly lies in the numbers. We've seen time and again how hardware revenue has declined for Microsoft, while income from <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/01/xbox-hardware-declines-but-content-and-services-grows-in-fy25-q2-earnings-report" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox content and services has increased</a>. It's no wonder the company's priorities have shifted. This change in strategy means Xbox can focus more on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/01/xboxs-multiplatform-releases-made-microsoft-the-top-game-publisher-in-the-world-last-month" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">becoming a publishing behemoth</a> while also making its games accessible to more players on all platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year Spencer talked about <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/01/xbox-is-evolving-rather-than-losing-its-identity-says-phil-spencer" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox having "evolved" its identity</a> in order to continue thriving amidst challenging times for the industry. Furthermore, he believes Xbox's new approach would be best adopted by the masses, to allow major developers and publishers to keep making high-budget AAA games. <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/01/xbox-has-right-approach-to-exclusives-and-playstation-may-follow-suggests-ori-dev" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moon Studios CEO Thomas Mahler recently agreed</a> with this idea, suggesting that, due to rising game development costs, the industry can only grow if it starts reducing its reliance on exclusives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it helps when those former <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/guides/best-xbox-exclusives" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox exclusives</a> actually sell in big numbers. Back in February 2024, Xbox announced that <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/hi-fi_rush" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hi-Fi RUSH</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/sea_of_thieves" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sea Of Thieves</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/pentiment" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pentiment</a> and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/grounded" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Grounded</u></a> would be heading to other systems, and we quickly discovered PlayStation and Nintendo owners had an appetite for games they previously couldn't play. Sea of Thieves, in particular, has become a massive success on PS5, and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/06/xbox-exec-talks-multiplatform-strategy-team-really-pleased-with-sea-of-thieves-on-ps5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft hasn't been shy in highlighting that fact</a>. That said, there was also criticism for suggesting <em>only</em> four titles would make the jump, which inevitably was never going to be the case once PlayStation owners started flocking to them in droves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that is the biggest issue I have with Xbox's new strategy at this point. Xbox has embarked on a major marketing campaign claiming <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/11/phil-spencer-explains-why-this-is-an-xbox-will-be-beneficial-to-console-owners" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">every device "is an Xbox"</a>, and everyone seems to have understood that message by now. However, it's never <em>really</em> explained what's happening with games going to PS5 and Switch. Initially it was four games, followed by a couple more, and eventually it might (okay, probably will) be Xbox's entire catalogue. Xbox fans still don't have a <em>truly</em> clear picture of what to anticipate, aside from rumours and the occasional hint from Phil Spencer.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Will Microsoft be able to sell hardware without major exclusives as a sweetener, and can&nbsp;Xbox Game Pass&nbsp;shift enough systems on its own?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Forza Horizon 5's debut on PS5 may feel like a new era or even the beginning of the end for some Xbox fans, but really it's just the evolution of a strategy that's been underway for some time – a strategy that's set to be very profitable in 2025. <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/features/reaction-like-it-or-not-xbox-has-gone-full-throttle-on-multiplatform" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The multiplatform push is in full swing</a>, and even though Microsoft clearly doesn't want to give us much of a roadmap, we're bound to see more <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/features/xbox-game-studios-all-microsoft-first-party-developers-and-what-theyre-working-on" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox first-party titles</a> on PS5, Nintendo Switch 2 and other platforms before the end of the year. It'll be fantastic from a business and industry perspective, but obviously sad for those who'd prefer Xbox to keeps its games down as exclusives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also no telling how it'll fare in the long run. What happens when the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/guides/next-xbox-console-everything-we-know-so-far-about-microsofts-next-gen-system" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next Xbox console</a> rolls around? What about the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/guides/xbox-handheld-everything-we-know-so-far-including-the-latest-rumours" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox handheld</a>? Will Microsoft be able to sell hardware without major exclusives as a sweetener, and can <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/guides/xbox-game-pass-in-2025-the-full-list-of-everything-announced-so-far" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Game Pass</a> shift enough systems on its own? I have no doubt Phil Spencer has thought about these questions and more and, hopefully, has answers to them. But there's a feeling of unease throughout the Xbox community right now, and Xbox will have to work harder than ever to keep its loyal fans coming back in the future. I just hope that's enough because Xbox is changing, forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Fraser Gilbert is the Editor of </em><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pure Xbox</em></a><em>.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div data-cy="carousel"><p><h2 data-cy="title1">Pure Xbox Column</h2></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
