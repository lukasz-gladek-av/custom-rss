The exclusive announcement trailer above introduces us to hero Fenrix Haven, a demon hunter who makes a deal with an angel for immortality, and the hordes of foes he'll have to slice and dice to prevent the resurrection of an ancient and pesky archdemon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat looks heavily inspired by Hades, and there are ranged weapons, melee attacks and special attacks called Celestial Blessings.  In the trailer we also get a glimpse of some of the other mechanics that will aid Fenrix on his journey, from a skill tree called The Grace of the Arbor to artifacts like a magically levitating hoverboard called the Jelly Engine. Weapons like silver-infused hammers, swords and a darkness cleaving shadow dagger can all be unlocked in the Magic Forge. This kit should come in handy when facing bosses - called Sealed Tyrants - as well as the Archdemon Asmodeusâ€™s army of minions.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ember and Blade First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The game can be <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://store.steampowered.com/app/3470500/Ember_and_Blade/__;!!AEH8rfA!yJrQDDnnvpE219JT_B04ODzEPOpYMedii6whg8kk9PUlem-18nRnGVPujVSuosiGm5sXUu_ERmJUElE$" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wishlisted</a> on Steam now ahead of its 2026 release, and developer Line Games is promising a playable demo in the second half of this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial.
