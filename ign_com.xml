Of course, OpenAI boss Sam Altman has allowed for his likeness to be used ‚Äî so here he is having a lightsaber battle with Pikachu:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Pokemon don't sue me ü•≤ Sora 2 is insane <a href="https://t.co/dInl6EysJl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/dInl6EysJl</a></p>‚Äî Pm Prod (@PMProdResearch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PMProdResearch/status/1973542955832185143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Pok√©mon, Nintendo's own Mario characters have been getting plenty of use.

"In short, we don't have a definitive answer yet," business lawyer and creator of the Virtual Legality podcast Richard Hoeg told IGN today. "There are indications in some quarters that training on protected materials is likely going to be deemed legal so long as the materials themselves were acquired for some lawful purpose (and not pirated). But on the output side, the Disney/Dreamworks lawsuit makes some good arguments for why/how the law should expect these platforms to police prompts for infringing requests, especially if they are already policing for something else (porn, bigotry, etc.). But all of those are still just arguments, not settled law..</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hoeg continued: "The law moves slowly, far slower than technology, which is why you see these tech companies racing ahead of it a bit. My best guess is that OpenAI is probably going to be okay long term on the training sets they used (assuming they weren't pirated), and that the 'opt out of training' option therefore won't do much of anything. Where they really need to concern themselves is on the output side and/or if they are marketing their software's abilities with protected content themselves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company for comment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, the famously litigious The Pok√©mon Company formally responded to the use of Pok√©mon TV hero Ash Ketchum and the series' theme tune by the Department of Homeland Security, as part of a video showing people being arrested and handcuffed by law enforcement agents. "Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content," a spokesperson told IGN, "and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while The Pok√©mon Company may not begin legal action over that usage, the firm is still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-mods-dont-count-as-prior-art-as-theyre-not-full-games-attempting-to-sway-judge-in-palworld-lawsuit">keenly battling on against Palworld developer Pocketpair</a> in its claim that the game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rewrites-patent-mid-case-in-ongoing-lawsuit-against-palworld-dev-pocketpair-but-why">infringed upon multiple patents</a>. Earlier this week, former Capcom designer Yoshiki Okamoto sparked a backlash in Japan after suggesting that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-capcom-designer-yoshiki-okamoto-sparks-backlash-in-japan-by-saying-palworld-has-crossed-a-line-that-should-not-be-crossed">Pok√©mon and Nintendo's legal action against Palworld was justified</a>, since Pocketpair's game had "crossed a line that should not be crossed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 developer Gearbox has released the looter shooter‚Äôs first big balance update since it came out, and it makes a number of significant buffs across the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Gearbox said its goal is to ‚Äúalways provide players with the tools and means to build their perfect Vault Hunter,‚Äù and it wants players to experiment and craft theories for builds by combining different gear, firmware, skills, and specialization trees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, it‚Äôs focused on creating greater build diversity by adjusting underperforming skills. Amon, the Vault Hunter considered by most to be weakest in the game, gets buffs that bring him closer to the other playable characters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, Vex's summons and Rafa's melee power were adjusted to make those builds more viable in the late endgame, Gearbox said. And Harlowe has a couple tweaks ‚Äúto make sure Stasis is getting value for players.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox had said it would leave overpowered builds, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-youtuber-tries-to-nerf-proof-their-character-instead-stumbles-upon-what-is-almost-certainly-an-unintended-interaction-that-does-so-much-damage-it-causes-bosses-total-existence-failure">even those based on what it called "unintended interactions,‚Äù</a> alone for the time being to focus on buffs, and the studio has remained true to its word with today‚Äôs patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, expect those builds to fall by the wayside somewhat in the future, Gearbox warned. ‚ÄúLooking to the future, we're investigating stats and behaviors on Class Mods, Rep Kits, Shields, and Firmware to make sure they are providing avenues to greater build diversity,‚Äù the studio said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe are also planning to fix a number of unintended interactions. These exploits prevent us from creating meaningful build diversity as they trivialize content that is otherwise meant to challenge players.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox continued: ‚ÄúWe're excited about the future of Borderlands 4 and its upcoming Post-Launch Roadmap. This is just the start of an exciting year of updates and content, and we can't wait to experience it all with our community.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting an additional improvement in the patch notes, below, which focuses not on balance but on performance. The update adds auto-clearing of Borderlands 4 stale shaders on version update, preventing performance degradation on some PCs.
