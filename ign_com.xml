Not only does that power Lumra up, but it could allow <a href="https://zdcs.link/91j4wA?object_uuid=6c2f0190-76ef-4c45-9957-ad805ccd01b2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Tannuk, Memorial Ensign</u></a> to dish out a whole host of punishment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also gives the World Shaper’s Hearthull spacecraft plenty of lands to sacrifice for card draw and damage pings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sticking with World Shaper, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgw8Z?object_uuid=6c2f0190-76ef-4c45-9957-ad805ccd01b2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Valakut Exploration</u></a> could be explosive, too. You can use it to exile cards to use for a big hit of damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s up to around $5, having cost barely anything just a few weeks ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, I've recently spotted a surprising team-up between Sonic the Hedgehog and the Tyranid Winged Hive Tyrant. The latter is up to $4 thanks to synergy with the Blue Blur, with the card giving other creatures with counters flying and haste.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That becomes a nice cycle of triggering an attack with Sonic, adding counters to other creatures, and then having them get flying and haste. Then, you can turn that into Treasure tokens, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to try this combo, have fun - <a href="https://zdcs.link/985MAR?object_uuid=6c2f0190-76ef-4c45-9957-ad805ccd01b2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Sonic is just $3 right now</u></a>, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgm8l?object_uuid=6c2f0190-76ef-4c45-9957-ad805ccd01b2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Winged Hive Tyrant</u></a> is on the climb but still under $5. There's a bunch of brillaint Sonic cards up for grabs right now as well, if you're not keen on picking up the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-sonic-the-hedgehog-secret-lair">full Secret Lair set</a>.</p><p id="crashers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Crashers">MTG Crashers This Week</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/01/crashers-mtg-sept-1-2025-1756727253876.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve already mentioned him, but <a href="https://zdcs.link/91j4wA?object_uuid=6c2f0190-76ef-4c45-9957-ad805ccd01b2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Tannuk, Memorial Ensign</u></a> is a great card for aggressive landfall decks, and he’s down to just a 25-cent market value.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given the synergies he has with the World Shaper deck and other cards we’ve mentioned here, that’s a steal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also not often to find an Eldrazi on the cheap, but <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8Dp0?object_uuid=6c2f0190-76ef-4c45-9957-ad805ccd01b2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Emrakul, the World Anew</u></a> has seen a drop off in recent weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This colorless 12/12 can gain control of opponents’ creatures and then sacrifice them, too.

It’s still almost $20, but this flying, lifelink Angel Wizard (what a combo, by the way) is dropping a couple of dollars and could drop further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7OBZ?object_uuid=6c2f0190-76ef-4c45-9957-ad805ccd01b2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Starfield Vocalist’s</u></a> more expensive versions remain pricey, but the basic rare is down to $1.49. Given it gives you double triggers on ETB effects, it could be worth looking at.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GoOM?object_uuid=6c2f0190-76ef-4c45-9957-ad805ccd01b2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>The Seriema</u></a> was one of the first cards revealed, and it’s dropped from $40 right down to $1.49 over the last month.</p><p id="sealed-sets"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sealed Sets">MTG Sealed Sets - Labor Day Deals</h2></p><div catalogid="a14fe182-2495-4e51-b750-54b3bf633d12" id="226460"><div id="226460" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy - Commander Deck Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally (<em>heh</em>), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-precons-bundle-discount-amazon-new"><u>we’ve been watching the price of the Final Fantasy Commander bundle over the last few weeks</u></a>, and it’s just hit $175.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given you’d have paid not far off that for a single deck not that long ago, you’re now essentially getting each for under MSRP at under $44 each.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Developer "focused on making the game as [optimized] as possible for default users."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> doesn't have ray-tracing, and its developer has said there are no plans to add the feature down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While ray-tracing has been notably missing from Battlefield 6's open beta tests, it wasn't entirely clear if this was just because the game was in beta or if it was a deliberate choice. Turns out, it's the latter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being a popular inclusion in some games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-ray-tracing"><u>ray-tracing's more natural method of simulating lighting</u></a> can also prove to be draining on your PC or console's system resources — and it's for this reason that the competitive shooter won't include it. Indeed, Christian Buhl — studio technical director at Ripple Effect, one of the studios working on Battlefield 6 — has told <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/battlefield-6-bf6-no-ray-tracing-pc-version/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Comicbook</u></a> that while the PC version of Battlefield 6 will have over 600 different options in its settings menu, "ray-tracing won’t be one of them and there’s no plans to bring it into the game in the near future."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“No, we are not going to have ray-tracing when the game launches and we don’t have any plans in the near future for it either,” Buhl said. “That was because we wanted to focus on performance. We wanted to make sure that all of our effort was focused on making the game as [optimized] as possible for the default settings and the default users. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So, we just made the decision relatively early on that we just weren’t going to do ray-tracing and again, it was mostly so that we could focus on making sure it was performance for everyone else."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While most people would likely sacrifice visuals to preserve performance during multiplayers mode, this may be disappointing news for some players who'd hoped to have ray-tracing in Battlefield 6's upcoming single-player campaign, when the time comes to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier today, we highlighted a nine-minute slice of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6s-battle-royale-footage-has-leaked-heres-what-it-shows-us"><u>Battlefield 6's battle royale mode that has leaked online</u></a>. This particular video not only gives a good look at what to expect from the mode, but also reveals a couple of gameplay mechanics we didn't previously know about, too, including swimming, one of the gadgets, and its "massive map."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 releases on October 7. We're having a great time with what we've played so far, writing in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer"><u>Battlefield 6 review-in-progress</u></a>: "Right now, even in beta form, Battlefield 6 might be the most fun shooter I’ve played this year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
