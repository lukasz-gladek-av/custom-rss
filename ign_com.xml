Is the discount indicative of Wizards of the Coast’s expectations for the set?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December, the price dropped to $159.99, bringing the Universes Beyond box of Play Boosters to around the standard price of a Universes Within box, but this now drops even further to $148.20 - the lowest we’ve seen at Amazon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With 30 packs, that’s less than five bucks per one ($4.94, to be precise), which is a couple of bucks off what you’d usually pay when buying them individually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We saw similar drops for Spider-Man, which would be a little worrisome if Avatar hadn’t got the same treatment - and that set was great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Magic: The Gathering, check out the wild ride that is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-full-release-schedule-updated-2026"><u>the game’s 2026 set lineup</u></a>, as well as our guide to preordering the first set of the year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-where-to-buy-2026"><u>Lorwyn Eclipsed</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 15, 2026 8:51 am</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-just-discounted-magics-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-set-to-its-lowest-price-ever]]></content:encoded>
