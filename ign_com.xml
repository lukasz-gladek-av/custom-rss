Maisy the Cow? We're less sure about that last one.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here, Geralt's quests are retold as plays by Dandelion, who holds the hero's fate in his hands. Whether sticking to the facts or stretching the truth, you'll need to keep Geralt's infamy in balance to ensure your run continues for as long as possible. And while your adventures with Geralt are likely to end in many deaths, each run will reward you with songbooks to perform on ever grander stages in the hope of ultimately reaching narrative immortality. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reigns: The Witcher is developed by Reigns series developer Nerial, and set for launch on February 25 for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1651600/Reigns_The_Witcher/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> and on mobile via Google Play and the iPhone App Store. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of Reigns: The Witcher this spring feels well-timed, amid a temporary lull in the launch of CD Projekt's bestselling series. The Witcher 4 is currently in "full production", its developer has said, but won't be ready in time for 2026. When it does arrive, however, CD Projekt has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-still-plans-to-launch-all-3-games-in-the-new-ciri-fronted-the-witcher-trilogy-within-a-6-year-period">planned an ambitious six-year roadmap in which it will also launch The Witcher 5 and The Witcher 6</a>. And before all of that, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-3-expansion-reports-continue-now-with-discussion-of-a-possible-dune-style-location">whispers abound that there's one final adventure coming to The Witcher 3</a> — though nothing, as yet, has been officially announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

It's a mixture of cinematics and gameplay. Check it out above. And if you know anything about this universe, you probably won't be surprised that the Orks are literally driven by mayhem and sporting a reckless, no-nonsense offensive playstyle. What you may not have been expecting is the scale of the carnage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In particular, we get a great look at the Ork superunit, the Gorkanaut, which can crumple up dreadnoughts and go toe-to-toe with the likes of an Imperial Knight. Towering over the battlefield at a scale that sets Dawn of War apart from its predecessors, the number of guns on this thing could be described as both bewildering and hilarious. And that's just what the Orks are about.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dawn of War 4 has been our IGN First "cover story" all January long.
