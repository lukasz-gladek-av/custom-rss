Although the key art certainly suggests it's the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/until-dawn-remastered">Until Dawn Remastered</a> that's coming, rather than the 2014 original, it's not entirely clear; we'll confirm just as soon as we know for sure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-plus"><u>PlayStation Plus</u></a> is an online gaming service for PlayStation platforms that includes free monthly games, limited-time trials, online multiplayer, and member-exclusive discounts. It also includes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/playstation-plus-premium-tier-games"><u>a catalog of hundreds of current and classic games</u></a> for Extra and Premium members, although the monthly free games are available to all players, regardless of their subscription tier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As speculated by some members of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1k7lixr/monthly_game_leaked/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation subreddit</u></a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/04/ps-plus-essential-game-for-may-2025-possibly-leaked-early" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PushSquare</u></a>), this could be a means of promoting the new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/until-dawn"><u>Until Dawn movie</u></a>, which released just ahead of the weekend. It didn't particularly impress us; we awarded it 5/10, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-movie-review-david-f-sandberg"><u>writing in IGN's Until Dawn movie review</u></a>: "Until Dawn is more disappointing than deadly, leaving all the promise of the horror game behind for a jumble of horror-movie re-creations." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's the same score we awarded the 2024 remaster, calling the game an "overpriced and under-featured remake that seems less like a must-have bit of moonlit murder and something closer to daylight robbery" in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/until-dawn-remastered"><u>IGN's Until Dawn Remastered review</u></a>.

Video producer Alex Battaglia called it “perhaps one of the worst-running games I've ever tested for Digital Foundry.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Even if you're running the most powerful hardware around, the stuttering is egregious, dragging down the experience to the point where I really don't understand how this was considered good enough for release,” Battaglia said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And beyond the hitching, we are looking at one of the most bizarrely resource-intensive games I've ever tested - so even if you're OK with lurching stutter, you'll be turning down the settings just to keep the average frame-rate looking acceptable.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps it comes as no surprise then to find that the most-downloaded Oblivion Remastered mod currently on Nexus Mods is P40L0’s ‘<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/35" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultimate Engine Tweaks</a> (Anti-Stutters - Lower Latency - No Film Grain - No Chromatic Aberration - Lossless),’ which has been downloaded a whopping 386,604 times in less than a week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the mod description:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Definitive Unreal ‘Engine.ini’ changes with the goal to remove most stutters, improve performance and stability, decrease input latency, improve picture clarity. All with no visual loss.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After months of UE5 testing, I would like to share my definitive custom ‘Engine.ini’ changes for the game,” P40L0 explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“My goal was to just include as many optimizations as possible (both for CPU/GPU/RAM/SSD) in order to remove most stuttering, improve performance, reduce input latency and improve picture clarity (e.g. by removing Film Grain &amp; Chromatic Aberration, optimize DLSS/FSR upscaling and more) all without any visual loss nor introducing glitches or crashes.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction to the mod from those who downloaded it is overwhelmingly positive. “Stutter be gone! Simply amazing, thanks!” declared chubbyd07. “This .ini is a miracle. From 15-20 fps outside the prison to 65-70 stable. Running on 3600XT and a 2060 with 20GB of RAM (yes),” added yeeto51. “Uhm, what the hell! I went from 60fps on High Preset around Waynon Priory to 90-110fps on the same location. Wizardry!!” said BabaSmith.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the PC version clearly has issued, Oblivion Remastered remains hugely popular, with an impressive Steam concurrent peak player count, and over 4 million players across all platforms. On Steam Oblivion Remastered has a ‘very positive’ user review rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, a hotfix pushed live on April 25 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-update-adds-unexpected-visual-issues-as-bethesda-works-on-a-fix">has affected Microsoft Store players’ UI settings for graphics</a>, specifically related to upscaling and anti-aliasing. At the time of this article’s publication. Microsoft Store players (so, those playing via Game Pass for PC), cannot adjust those settings due to the issue with the settings UI. Bethesda has said it’s on the case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Oblivion Remastered, including a report on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-player-escapes-the-confines-of-cyrodiil-to-explore-valenwood-skyrim-and-even-hammerfell-the-rumored-setting-of-the-elder-scrolls-vi">a player who managed to escape the confines of Cyrodiil to explore Valenwood, Skyrim, and even Hammerfell, the rumored setting of The Elder Scrolls VI</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've also got a comprehensive guide to everything you'll find in Oblivion Remastered, including an expansive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/cyrodiil">Interactive Map</a>, complete Walkthroughs for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Main_Quest_Walkthrough">Main Questline</a> and every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Guilds">Guild Quest</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Character_Building_Guide">How to Build the Perfect Character</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Things_to_Do_First_in_Oblivion">Things to Do First</a>, every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/PC_Cheats_and_Console_Commands">PC Cheat Code</a>, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-3-tv-show-vs-game-comparison<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Flowers, first kills, and ‘okay’ kisses. </h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The following article contains </em><em><strong>spoilers </strong></em><em>for The Last of Us season 2, episode 3.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week’s episode of The Last of Us takes a moment to grieve and breathe after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-2-review">last week’s showstopper</a>. It also takes a little detour from the game; much of this episode depicts the reaction of Jackson’s people to the events they’ve just suffered, and their vote on if they should pursue Abby or not. This is all original material for the show, and so there’s actually very few scenes in this episode that are taken straight from the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are four key sequences from this episode that are recreations of moments from the game, and here we’ve compared them against the original source material, analysing what’s changed and what’s stayed the same. You can see both versions in the video above, or read on below for our written explanations. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Joel’s House</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/house-1745831568199.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the harrowing murder of Joel in episode 2, Ellie visits her deceased father-figure’s house to mourn. As in the game, the front yard is covered in flowers left by the residents of Jackson. Unlike the game, though, Ellie enters alone rather than accompanied by Dina. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The show’s version of Joel’s house features many of the same props that decorated this location in the game, including his workshop room full of carved animals. In Joel’s bedroom, the bed linen is the same blue and white sheets. More importantly there’s the same red box on the bed that contains his signature items: the broken watch and his revolver. Ellie takes these and holsters the revolver in the waistband of her jeans, just as she does in the game.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Tommy’s Plans</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/tommy-revenge-1745831590003.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The need for revenge begins to rise when Ellie talks to Tommy about what happened. While the broad strokes of this scene are the same in both show and game, particularly in tone, the actual setting and words are not recreated one-to-one. In both versions Ellie is angry and frustrated that Tommy wants to be more sensible about their next move, and so tonally the scenes match. However, where in the game this conversation takes place in a quiet, private room between just the two of them, in the show it’s conducted out in the open with Dina present.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of dialogue there are close matches – both versions of Ellie say that Joel “would be halfway to Seattle by now” if the situation was reversed. Both versions of Tommy also note that Jackson would be left vulnerable, although in the show this is a clear reference to the prior episode’s horde attack rather than the game’s more general assessment. In both scenarios Tommy says it’s ultimately up to Maria as to if they get to hunt down Abby, but in the show he says that it will need to go to a full town vote, while the game version says he expects there will be “folks she can spare”. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Ride to Seattle</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/horse-1745831609043.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Ellie and Dina head out to Seattle on horseback in search of Abby and her group. In both versions Dina asks Ellie to recall the first person she killed, and Ellie proceeds to explain how she saved Joel from a bandit in the first game/season. While the show’s dialogue is not an exact match to the game’s script, the details are largely the same – Joel was attacked and Ellie pulled the trigger to save him. The conversation is longer in the game, however, as Dina reciprocates with her own story of her first kill. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later, the pair discover an overgrown car, which they consider a sign that they’re finally close to Seattle. This is, again, broadly similar to a moment from the game, even if the dialogue line is not a one-to-one match. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6 out of 10</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/kiss-1745831633066.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the episode we see Ellie and Dina camped out in a tent. Before lights out, Dina asks Ellie a question: how would she rate their kiss at the dance out of 10? This moment is a recreation of a scene from the game, but the timing and content of this conversation is notably different to the original game version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the game, Dina asks Ellie to rate the kiss while they are smoking marijuana at Eugene’s weed den. As we know from last week’s episode, this doesn’t happen in the show since it is Jesse, not Dina, who accompanies Ellie to Eugene’s den. It’s not just the time and location of this exchange that is altered, though. In the show, Ellie says that she’d rate the kiss a six, something that Dina is playfully upset about. In the game, it’s flipped – Ellie hesitates to answer, and so Dina says she’d score it a “solid six”. The two interpretations showcase very different dynamics; Dina in the game is much more confident and knows how to pull Ellie’s strings – she enjoys teasing her. Dina in the show, meanwhile, is depicted as more “teenage” in her approach, which emphasises the “young girls in the apocalypse” element of their love story.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from The Last of Us, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-spoiler-free">spoiler-free season two review</a> and our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-3-review">spoiler-filled review of the third episode</a>.
