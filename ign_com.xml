"In a world where everything we did 10 years ago was about selling shiny discs in plastic boxes in retail shelves — well, that’s still a <em>part</em> of our business, it’s a significantly smaller part of our business, and we now have pricing representing everything from free-to-play all the way to deluxe editions and beyond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At the end of the day, whether we're doing something that costs a dollar, or we're doing something that costs $10, or we're doing something that costs $100, our objective is always to deliver incredible quality and exponential value for our playerbase," said Wilson. "And what we've discovered over the course of time is [when] we can marry quality and value together, our business is strong, resilient, and continues to grow."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"From a guidance perspective [...] we have reflected no changes in our current [pricing] strategy at this point," added CFO Stuart Canfield.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It'll be welcome news to some, given just last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raises-the-price-of-all-xbox-series-consoles-xbox-games-confirmed-to-hit-80-this-holiday"><u>Microsoft confirmed it was raising Xbox prices</u></a> as well as increasing the cost of controllers, headsets, and some games.
