Rebellion is the developer behind the popular Sniper Elite series of games, as well as the spin-off Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army entries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb:</p><blockquote>A UK-based post-apocalyptic survival-action game, Atomfall is inspired by the real life Windscale nuclear incident in the 1950s. Players will embark on a fictionalized adventure meeting a cast of weird and wonderful characters as they try to uncover the mystery and escape the quarantine zone.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are delighted that so many players are enjoying Atomfall,” said Jason Kingsley CBE, CEO and co-founder of Rebellion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To have surpassed the 1 million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion. Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are a British company, and the game is a true reflection of that. Not only is it set in the lush, beautiful countryside but Atomfall also draws inspiration from so many classic British books, films and TV series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We hope that players continue to enjoy exploring the world of Atomfall and are looking forward to future content for the game.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Atomfall Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Atomfall launched simultaneously across PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox Series X and S and Xbox One, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-announces-xbox-game-pass-march-2025-wave-2-lineup">it also released on Game Pass as a day-one title</a>, which will have significantly boosted player numbers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rebellion did not say how many copies of the game were sold, however, preferring, like Assassin’s Creed Shadows maker Ubisoft, to go down the player number route. But it did provide some fun stats to back up it announcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over 316,000 Atomfall players, for example, have killed the scientist at the very beginning of the game. In total there have been over 3.7 million kills using the cricket bat, while over 4 million pasties and 300,000 cups of tea have been consumed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/atomfall-review">Atomfall review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Atomfall is a compelling, post-apocalyptic survival story that satisfyingly bends to your choices and discoveries no matter which direction you take."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
