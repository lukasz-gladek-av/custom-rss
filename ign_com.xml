            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 players aren't happy after EA and Battlefield Studios' changes to two of its most controversial cosmetics failed to live up to expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-to-alter-2-controversial-cosmetics-after-fans-accuse-ea-of-ai-generated-content-and-call-of-duty-ghosts-inspiration"><u>promises to address fan feedback</u></a> last week, the Battlefield community was quick to see how update 1.1.3.6 adjusted the Objective Ace skin and Winter Warning sticker when the patch went live this morning. The problem is the changes are almost too small to notice.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— DETONATED (@DETONATEDcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/DETONATEDcom/status/2018712937670627367?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 3, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s first take a look at Objective Ace. The skin drew criticism through Season 1 when players noticed it bore a striking resemblance to the Call of Duty: Ghosts logo, with both sharing even a few finer details, such as cracks and paint streaks. The Assault skin also caught flak related to the large white armor piece located on its chest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The updated version of the cosmetic received the more noticeable facelift of the two impacted, with its updated look now featuring new details and a slimmer design overall. Still, it’s not enough for the players who were expecting more significant changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“[I] think the damage has already been done,” one <a href="https://x.com/BABYBLUBERRYZ/status/2018723941251256755?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>player commented</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Why did they copy COD in the first place?” <a href="https://x.com/Negan259/status/2018713351526748283?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another added</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">AI Sticker Before VS After Patch <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Battlefield6</a> <a href="https://t.co/Srfjhp7ZHj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Srfjhp7ZHj</a></p>— Battlefield Intel (@BattlefieldInte) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldInte/status/2018666389972902043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 3, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Winter Warning sticker, on the other hand, was the center of controversy when players noticed details that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-fans-accuse-ea-of-selling-ai-generated-image-after-spotting-what-looks-like-an-m4a1-with-two-barrels"><u>suggested it may have been created using generative AI</u></a>. Battlefield 6 update 1.1.3.6 seems to have brought no change to its design, with its soldier finger placement and double-barreled M4A1 still plainly in view despite being two of the bigger talking points amongst fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been cause for concern for those who feel EA and BF Studios may have misled fans. However, the developers have since <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2018746377569013844?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stepped in</a> to say the timing relayed in last week’s patch notes, which promised to adjust Winter Warning with the February 3 update, was “incorrect.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The latest update notes communicated that a change would be made for the Winter Warning Player Card Sticker to bring it more in line with Battlefield’s visual identity,” a message shared today says. “This timing was incorrect. Winter Warning will be updated when Season 2 launches on February 17th.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear what the new version of the sticker will look like when it launches with Season 2 in about two weeks. For now, players have taken to social media to call attention to both the delay and the relatively small changes to the cosmetics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Show what ur doing with it," one <a href="https://x.com/DANNYonPC/status/2018746669802692706?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fan suggested</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Stop using AI generated Art and cosmetics and we will trust this statement and future ones," <a href="https://x.com/LordVonTiger/status/2018747014855430637?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another added</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-was-the-best-selling-console-of-2025-in-the-us-and-is-still-outpacing-the-nintendo-switch"><u>a strong start</u></a> when it released October 10, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S but has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/losing-steam-3-months-after-launch-its-time-for-a-check-in-with-battlefield-6-and-its-community"><u>faced backlash in recent weeks</u></a> as players hope for fundamental changes to how BF Studios is handling post-launch content. The fallout from a disappointing end to Season 1 reached a boiling point in early January, with the team eventually announcing that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-to-february-as-ea-tackles-community-feedback-with-an-extended-season-1"><u>Season 2 had been delayed</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following an extended Season 1, Season 2 will launch February 17.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The CEO of Take-Two Interactive has denied ongoing rumors that Grand Theft Auto 6 will be a digital-only release upon its initial launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Variety, which spoke to CEO Strauss Zelnick today ahead of the company's Q3 2026 earnings release. When asked if subsidiary Rockstar would delay the release of physical copies of GTA 6 until 2027 to avoid leaks, he replied, "That's not the plan."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rumors of such a physical delay <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/grand-theft-auto-6-may-not-have-a-physical-version-on-day-one-to-avoid-leaks-report-claims/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emerged late last month</a>, when an alleged insider industry source shared that Take-Two had no plans for a physical edition of the game at release due to concerns about physical copies falling into hands early and leaking online.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, the report suggests that physical copies could be delayed into 2027, or delayed just a few weeks, which would make Zelnick's answer somewhat unclear. IGN reached out to Take-Two to get more clarity on what his statement meant, and was informed that Zelnick's statement was denying any delay plan at all, not just a move to 2027 specifically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 is still set for release on November 18, 2026, a date that Zelnick <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-marketing-will-kick-off-this-summer-as-take-two-confidently-reaffirms-november-release-date">reaffirmed confidently to us today</a>, alongside plans for Rockstar to spin up its marketing machine this summer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto VI's November 19, 2026 release date is drawing nearer. And while the game has now suffered multiple delays, Take-Two Interactive is starting to sound more confident than we've ever heard them that this time, it's really happening. So confident, in fact, it's announced that Rockstar will be spinning up its marketing beats this summer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Take-Two's Q3 2026 earnings results, which were just released. In those earnings, Take-Two reaffirms that GTA 6 is indeed still planned for November 19, 2026. That on its own would be exciting news after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">two</a> separate <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">delays</a>, but even better is a sentence at the bottom of the release sent to IGN. "Our execution throughout Fiscal 2026 has been extraordinary and we are highly confident as we approach Fiscal 2027 – which promises to be groundbreaking for Take-Two and the entire entertainment industry – led by the November 19th release of Grand Theft Auto VI with Rockstar’s launch marketing set to begin this Summer. "</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's sounding pretty confident, to me! Speaking to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick earlier today, I asked him how he felt about the release date at this time, to which he replied, "I feel good about it. Very good about it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, we've asked Zelnick this before, and he said he felt "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">really good</a>" about the fall 2025 release date that was originally announced, ahead of two delays. So I asked him if this time was different in some way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course," he said. "Because any time you're getting closer to marketing beats, you're obviously in a place where your confidence level is as high as it can be."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 is one of the most anticipated games of all time, with many already suggesting it as a potential Game of the Year contender despite us not having seen any gameplay footage of it yet, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/increasingly-convincing-ai-generated-gta-6-gameplay-leaks-are-getting-millions-of-views-on-social-media">leaks and AI fakes</a> going viral all over social media late last year, and its delays having <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-the-gta-6-delay-also-delay-next-gen-consoles">potential industry-shaking impacts</a>. So far, we've seen two cinematic trailers for the game, which have shown the dual protagonists Duval and Lucia Caminos, and the setting of Leonida, Florida, including the infamous Vice City.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even without GTA 6, GTA as a franchise had a great quarter. It "vastly outpaced" Take-Two's forecasts, with GTA+ membership levels nearly doubling year-over-year. We asked Zelnick for insight as to the cause of GTA 5's excellent quarter, and he pointed to the Safehouse in the Hills update for GTA Online doing especially well. GTA 5 has now sold over 225 million units.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, Take-Two brought in net bookings of $1.76 billion for the quarter. The company is raising its expectations in light of a better-than-expected quarter on multiple fronts, with total annual net bookings expected to range between $6.65 billion to $6.7 billion, representing around 18% growth year over year. Take-Two expects that nearly half of its full-year earnings, which it will report next quarter, will come from its mobile business, Zynga.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

One property that exemplifies that in recent years is The Lord of the Rings. Last year, we took a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-review">The Fellowship of the Ring Trick-Taking Game</a>, and now the adventure continues with the next entry, The Two Towers Trick-Taking Game, designed by Bryan Bornmueller and published by Asmodee. Whether you played the previous game or not, it’s time to don your leather armor, because The Two Towers is well worth picking up.</p><div id="234625"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234625" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Two Towers: Trick-Taking Game</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As the name implies, The Two Towers Trick-Taking Game plays like your typical <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trick-taking-games">trick-taking game,</a> with players competing to win hands of cards – referred to as tricks – by playing and following a special suit that is led at the start of each round. What makes The Two Towers (and its predecessor) unique is that it's a purely <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative game</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I knew this going in, having not played The Fellowship of the Ring, I wasn’t entirely sure how this was going to work – but in a few moments, it quickly became clear, and I found it rather clever. In order to progress, each character has to succeed in their respective goals, such as the Gimli player being required to win six mountain-suited cards or Boromir winning two tricks before the Black Tower card is played, and no more afterwards. What makes The Two Towers (and the previous game) a cooperative experience is that, while you are still competing against other players to take the tricks, the team is working to complete every one of the active characters’ goals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Included in the small box are 19 chapters to play through, though “scenarios” would be a more apt term to describe them. Each of the chapters gives you a number of options. You have different playable characters to choose from. You can play either a short or long version of the chapter. You can even add in new characters or objectives. With short missions, you only need to complete a single game with all players successfully completing their goals. Long missions require you and your friends to play through multiple games back-to-back in order to complete all the possible characters' objectives, with losing scrapping any progress you'd made so far (though you can just opt to replay those characters too).</p><p>What makes The Two Towers (and its predecessor) unique is that it's a purely cooperative game.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Two Towers is billed as a standalone expansion, but a standalone “continuation” may be more appropriate, which would make sense considering the source material. If you played The Fellowship, The Two Towers will feel incredibly similar. There are a couple of new types of cards, including the Orcs, which can only be played when you can’t follow, can never win a trick; worst of all, if you are forced to lead with an Orc, you all lose the chapter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The White and Black Tower cards are also new, with each one always winning the trick they are played during but canceling each other out if played during the same one. The White Tower also fills in for the One Ring from the previous game, with whoever is dealt the card assuming the role of Aragorn and the first hand’s leader.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Individual games are pretty quick, with a typical short mission only taking up maybe 10–15 minutes. The length of longer missions, since they are composed of multiple full games to complete, fluctuate depending on how many games you end up needing to play. The short turnaround makes this a great option to bust out whether you only have time for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">quick-playing game</a>, or you want to do a marathon and get through a bunch of chapters in a single go over the course of an afternoon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I appreciate when games offer that sort of flexibility. These short game times are helped along with the overall small footprint the game takes up, both in terms of its box and tablespace. As someone who loves to frequent my local tavern much like a hobbit, the fact that the box can easily fit into a backpack or purse is a nice touch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My experience with the trick-taking genre has been mostly with straightforward, competitive games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euchre" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euchre</a>, where I’ve only had to deal with navigating around a trump suit. I've found myself enamored with The Two Towers and its cooperative approach. Celebrating a shared victory with the entire table thanks to a clutch trump on the last hand to secure the win has a vastly different feeling than pulling a surprise trick in Euchre that wins a game for just your team. There is also no feeling quite like being forced to play an Orc card and losing it all in Euchre, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From a visual standpoint, I adore the stained glass aesthetic of all of the cards and artwork, and busting this game out at my local brewery, its visuals have caused more than a couple of fellow tavern visitors to stop and ask, “What’s that?!”. The cards themselves almost garnered more glances than our random outbursts cursing orcs (but only just). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a solo and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player</a> mode, and while I only dabbled in the solo mode, my wife and I enjoyed the two-player variation. This variant features a third game-controlled player whose hand of cards is placed in a reveal pyramid, with only cards that aren’t covered up able to be played. It reminded me a lot of 7 Wonders Duel, but I enjoyed it more than managing multiple hands in solo mode. To be fair, though, I’m not much of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a> player in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As much as I have enjoyed actually playing The Two Towers Trick-Taking Game, my favorite part of the game has surprisingly been the moment each new chapter scenario is revealed. As someone who loves fantasy books, and especially The Lord of the Rings, I always get a kick out of seeing how the next moments of the book will be represented, what new character cards are pulled, and what we have to do next. Much like Fellowship, once all of the chapters are complete, a repeatable mode rule is there to let you and your group play afterwards, coming up with challenging character combinations and goals as you want. And for those who own Fellowship, there are rules to mix the two games’ characters together once the campaign is done, though both games’ cards have unique backs so you will always be able to separate them back out again.</p><p>For those who own Fellowship, there are rules to mix the two games’ characters together.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">My main critique, and a minor one at that, is that I would have appreciated heavier strategic elements. Even with the various goals of the characters and twists of the chapters to keep things interesting, I would have loved some aspect that lends itself more to strategy than the more luck-based nature these sorts of games lean toward. But even this complaint is more a “wouldn’t it be neat if…” sort of wish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After playing The Two Towers Trick-Taking Game, I was instantly searching online to get myself the Fellowship version, as I just wanted more. The cooperative take on the trick-taking genre, mixed with beloved characters and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-books-reading-order">stories of J.R.R. Tolkien</a>, meshes wonderfully into a solid and replayable package. Seeing as it's a cooperative game makes this a solid choice to introduce the genre to new folks , but if you aren’t a fan of trick takers at a mechanical level, I’m not sure this will win you over. Still, thanks to its small footprint and easy setup, The Two Towers Trick-Taking Game is an easy recommendation, and a must-get if you loved the Fellowship version.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Two Towers Trick-Taking Game</strong></p></div></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">The Two Towers: The Trick Taking Game picks up right where the Fellowship game leaves off and delivers a wonderful cooperative experience for fans of both the Lord of the Rings and the trick taking genre, but can be just as easily picked up and played on its own. The new cards and mechanisms in Two Towers helps keep things exciting but for those its reliance on the luck of your the draw still mean that for folks looking for a heavier and more strategic experience would best be served elsewhere.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-two-towers-trick-taking-game-review]]></content:encoded>
