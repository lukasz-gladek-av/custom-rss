            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">2013's Batman: Arkham Origins may not be the most critically beloved entry in the series, but many fans would argue it's the game with the best Batman costume design. Now Hot Toys is finally giving that costume its due with a truly stunning 1/6 scale figure. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out the slideshow gallery below for an early look at Hot Toys' Batman: Arkham Origins figure:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hot Toys Batman: Arkham Origins 1/6 Scale Figure Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This figure stands an impressive 12.7 inches tall and features a detailed recreation of the character model from the game. The head boasts individually rotating eyeballs and interchangeable faceplates that allow for different expressions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The figure also includes various other accessories you'd expect, including Batman's various gadgets and weapons, electric gauntlets, and interchangeable hands. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is hardly Hot Toys' first time exploring the Arkham universe. In the past, they've released figures based on Batman's Arkham City and Arkham Knight designs, along with several of the alternate suits from those games and villains like Joker and Harley Quinn.  As for Arkham Origins specifically, Hot Toys previously tackled Deathstroke (who makes a cameo appearance in the photos above) and Batman's armored XE Suit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Batman: Arkham Origins figure is priced at $300 and is available to <a href="https://zdcs.link/a56E3L?object_uuid=ad4192bd-15a0-404c-b164-40246c1dbabd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder on Sideshow Collectibles</a>. The figure is expected to release between January and June of 2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more Hot Toys fun, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-stunning-hot-toys-figure-recreates-dcs-most-iconic-joker-cover">their Killing Joke-inspired Joker figure</a> and their massive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-galactus-finally-revealed-thanks-to-new-hot-toys-figure">The Fantastic Four: First Steps Galactus figure</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> sales over the holidays reportedly fell short of those recorded by the console's predecessor back in 2017, during its first end-of-year season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As revealed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_NUBDTG8_4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a>, Switch 2 sales in the US and within key markets in Europe fell behind the equivalent pace of Switch 1 — something an unnamed senior Nintendo source blamed on a "complicated" economic climate today, and the "absence of a major Western game" during the year-end period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That particular analysis will likely raise eyebrows among Nintendo fans, as the company launched the long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> during the period — albeit to a more muted critical response than the franchise's beloved original trilogy. Nintendo has so far made no announcement on how that game has fared.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Business reports that US Switch 2 sales over the holiday period were down around 35% versus the Switch 1's sales performance back in 2017. In the UK, a similar comparison saw Switch 2 lagging Switch 1 by 16%. Even in Nintendo's homeland of Japan, Switch 2 holiday sales couldn't match Switch 1, and were down by 5.5% over the year's final nine weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In France, 2025's final tally of Switch 2 sales was down by "over 30%" versus the amount Switch 1 notched up back in 2017, meanwhile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While these numbers may take some of the shine off of a successful first year for Switch 2 overall, it's not all doom and gloom. Switch 2's lifetime sales in Japan are still above what Switch 1 managed in its first year, with less time on sale. And in the UK, Switch 1 continued to sell well enough that it made up Switch 2's holiday sales deficit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking ahead, Nintendo has a smattering of first-party games already planned for 2026, including Mario Tennis Fever, Yoshi and the Mysterious Book and Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave, as well as Switch 2 upgrades for Super Mario Wonder and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. There's also the FromSoftware exclusive The Duskbloods to look forward to, and the promising-looking Pokémon Pokopia life sim.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Animal Crossing: New Horizons – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But as the Switch 2 prepares to celebrate its first anniversary in June, all eyes will be on Nintendo to roll out a truly new blockbuster entry in one of its biggest franchises. Back in 2017, Switch 1's first year was marked by the launch of both Super Mario Odyssey and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Nintendo has not released a major new 3D Mario platformer since, while it will soon be three years since the arrival of 2023's The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch 1's other top-selling titles include Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Animal Crossing: New Horizons — and for now, there's no suggestion a big new entry in either franchise is forthcoming. Smash Bros. series boss Masahiro Sakurai has only just finished work on Kirby Air Riders, while Nintendo is opting to update New Horizons for Switch 2 this year, as previously mentioned. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could we see a new 3D Mario in 2026? Nine years on from Super Mario Odyssey, now feels like the right time. And then there's Pokémon, which celebrates its 30th anniversary next month. Could we get a glimpse soon of the series' long-awaited 10th generation? The arrival of these titles would certainly help Switch 2 keep its momentum, following last year's explosive launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
