A closed beta test will also be happening from January 16-22 in the U.S., Canada, and select parts of Europe. Watch the new gameplay trailer above.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-announced-as-story-driven-action-adventure-rpg-coming-to-mobile">Announced</a> at The Game Awards last month, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is a class-based game where you can play as a longsword-wielding Knight, the Sellsword that takes inspiration from the Wildlings and Dothraki and promises "raw, aggressive, and destructive" combat, or the Faceless Man-inspired, dual-dagger-wielding Assassin. Gameplay will have "fully manual" controls – no doubt a nod to Kingsroad's mobile game roots.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Story-wise, Netmarble describes the setup for Kingsroad as follows: "Players will experience a brand-new story as they take on the role of a new character, who, through a quirk of fate, becomes the heir to House Tyre, a small noble house in the North."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Netmarble says, "Players can sign up for the Regional Closed Beta now through January 12 on the <a href="https://gameofthrones.netmarble.com/en/cbt?utm_source=ign&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=cbt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official game website</a> to play the game on Android devices and through Windows launcher on PC." The full game release will occur later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

We visited Capcom’s offices in Japan, where we played the first five hours or so of Monster Hunter Wilds, and exclusively faced a few Oilwell Basin local monsters. Look out for more gameplay throughout January, along with in-depth interviews, fun details, and a final preview for Monster Hunter Wilds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out the videos featuring the fierce Fanged Wyvern, Ajarakan, the abhorrent Brute Wyvern, Rompopolo, and a variety of weapons in the Rompopolo video at the top of this page and in the Ajarakan video below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is also our first good, extended look of the Oilwell Basin locale, where “<a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/living-world/ecosystems/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>oil wells up from the ground and accumulates in deep pools of oilsilt</u></a>,” as the name implies. In the new gameplay, you can see the Oilwell Basin transition between its three “weather” cycles: the barren Fallow, the burning inclemency, the Firespring; and the peaceful Plenty. Can you tell which is which? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">During our visit, the Monster Hunter developers revealed that some of the Oilwell Basin was inspired by the deep sea, which you can see more apparently in the exclusive new image of one of the caves in the depths of the Oilwell Basin below. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">IGN First Monster Hunter Wilds Oilwell Basin Artwork</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We also learned the mucky Oilsilt isn’t all bad news for us hunters–you can ignite Oilsilt Spouts with Torch Pods to cause explosions. Keep an eye out for Chillmantle Bugs, too, to offset the effects of the scorching heat during the Firespring, and to counter some monsters that are just too hot to handle, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds is set to be released on February 28, 2025 globally on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, and will feature cross-platform multiplayer at launch. Don’t miss our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for"><u>first hands-on preview</u></a>, and keep it locked here for the month of January for even more Monster Hunter Wilds! </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Casey DeFreitas is deputy guides editor at IGN and has been hunting monsters since the PS2 era.

At least some of the remaining Private Division employees are expected to be laid off in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is according to a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, which states that a currently unnamed company staffed by former Annapurna Interactive employees has reached a deal with private equity firm Haveli to take over the distribution of Private Division titles. Bloomberg reports and IGN can independently confirm that Haveli <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/private-division-sold-to-unknown-buyer">is the company that purchased Private Division from Take-Two Interactive last year for an undisclosed amount</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The portfolio includes both current and upcoming Private Division titles, such as Tales of the Shire, which releases March 25. It also includes Project Bloom, a AAA action-adventure game developed by Game Freak that was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-bloom-pokemon-game-freak-private-division">announced back in 2023</a> with nothing more than a concept art teaser.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/pd-gf-projectbloom-conceptart-3840x2160-1683657401083-1736271759393.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Concept art for Game Freak's Project Bloom, formerly published by Private Division.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Bloomberg reports, Haveli's purchase of Private Division included not just the portfolio, but 20 employees who remained with the label <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division">following Take-Two-implemented layoffs last spring</a>. Remaining employees have reportedly been told to explore other employment options, with the expectation that at least some of them will be laid off as part of the deal with the unnamed new publisher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Private Division was formerly Take-Two's publishing label, which the company founded back in 2017. It was intended to support independent games that were smaller than the fare typically supported by the Grand Theft Auto publisher. Over the years, Private Division produced titles such as The Outer Worlds, OlliOlli World, and Kerbal Space Program 2, but game sales repeatedly fell short of Take-Two expectations. Early last year, we reported that Take-Two was slowly shuttering operations at Private Division, first by winding down operations at its supported studios and then by selling off the label.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new owners of Private Division's portfolio are a group of former employees of Annapurna Interactive that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/annapurnas-entire-gaming-team-has-resigned">collectively resigned last year</a> following a leadership dispute at Annapurna. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-heck-has-been-going-on-at-annapurna-interactive-an-investigation">reported last fall on the messy circumstances</a>, which left Annapurna seeking to restaff an entire publishing team to cover its numerous obligations and roughly 25 individuals seeking new employment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
