            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds"><u>Monster Hunter Wilds</u></a> patch 1.041 is now live, and it's a big one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marking the game's anniversary, from now until March 18, there'll be a login bonus plus rotations of past Festivals of Accord. And, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-developing-another-monster-hunter-wilds-large-scale-expansion-similar-to-iceborne"><u>as we learned last week</u></a>, we're also getting the Arch-Tempered Arkveld, 10-star Arc-Tempered monsters, a special collaboration with Monster Hunter Stories 3 — a spin-off series that releases next month — plus an anniversary event where all previous awards and quests will be "re-available."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also learned last week that Monster Hunter Wilds will welcome a "large-scale" expansion later this year. Addressing fans in a video celebrating the open-world adventure game's first anniversary, series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto teased that this expansion will be similar to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-world"><u>Monster Hunter World</u></a>'s Iceborne add-on, but was otherwise coy about the details. He did, however, stress that this will be the "final update" for the monster hunting game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds has had something of a bumpy ride. Title Update 4 arrived at the end of last year and ushered in a long list of gameplay and balance changes, as well as CPU/GPU improvements, load reduction, and the optimization of "PC-specific processes and addition of options and presets to reduce processing load." A development roadmap, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-sets-out-roadmap-to-improve-performance-on-pc-starting-with-title-update-4"><u>detailed in December</u></a>, outlined plans to address the myriad issues impacting the PC version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Note that you won't be able to access DLC or play online multiplayer until this update has been installed. Steam users are also advised to update to driver versions to NVIDIA GeForce 581.57 (or newer) or AMD Radeon: 25.9.1. (or newer). "Some issues have been identified with AMD Radeon drivers versions 25.10.2 and higher on certain PCs using AMD Radeon graphics cards such as the AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT/7800 XT," the team warned.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Full patch notes for Monster Hunter Wilds Ver.1.041.00.00 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Release Date</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Wednesday February 18, 2026 2:30 a.m. UTC (Tuesday February 17, 2026 6:30 p.m. PT)</li><li>Note: Release date and time are subject to change without prior notice.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Required Space (Current Update Only)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>PlayStation5: Approx. 13.0 GB</li><li>Xbox Series X|S: Approx. 16.0 GB</li><li>Steam: Approx. 15.0 GB (With High Resolution Texture Pack: Approx. 18.0 GB total)</li><li>Note: Make sure to have enough additional storage to allow for slight differences in final size.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Major Additions and Changes</strong></h3><strong>Monsters</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>– Arch-tempered Arkveld has been added as a permanent Event Quest.</li><li>– New 10★ difficulty quests have been added as permanent event quests for the following monsters: Arch-tempered Rey Dau, Arch-tempered Uth Duna, Arch-tempered Nu Udra, and Arch-tempered Jin Dahaad.</li></ul><strong>Player</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>– New equipment and pendants have been added.</li></ul><strong>Story Progression</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>– Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection Special Collaboration side mission "A Royal Request" has been added.
