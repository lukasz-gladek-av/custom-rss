            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Some of my favorite games of all time.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Labor Day weekend is a great time to get together with the family, sure, but it's also a nice little three-day window to get some serious gaming in. Assuming you don't already have a massive backlog of PC games to play, now is actually a pretty good time of year to find some video game deals. If you're looking to pick up a new game before the weekend arrives, you've got options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're in between major Steam sales at the moment, but another big PC games sale going on right now is the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2Dlm?object_uuid=57482acb-3f94-473a-b83a-8fac5977e551&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Humble Bundle Summer Sale</a>. There are a ton of discounted games here at prices that will last through the weekend. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for something great under $10, I've got some recommendations for you. Each of these games I've listed are wonderful for different reasons, but every single one of them are worth playing for hours at a time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PC Games Under $10</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">My first pick might not be for everyone, but it's one of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-of-my-favorite-pc-games-of-all-time-is-super-cheap-during-the-humble-bundle-summer-sale">my favorite gaming experiences</a> of all time. It's hard to really go too into detail without ruining some of it, but it's essentially a roguelike deck-building card game with a twist of psychological horror. If any of that sounds interesting to you, it's best to just start playing without learning more. Going in cold is the best way to play this game.</p><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227072"><div id="227072" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Inscryption</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Next on this list is what has become one of the best indie games of all time. I was genuinely surprised how much I liked Hollow Knight. I don't usually like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/genre/metroidvania">metroidvania games</a>, but it has a sort of sad, dark charm that really drew me in. The gameplay is fun and the battles can get difficult, but the atmosphere of this game keeps you engaged at every turn. With the long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">Hollow Knight sequel releasing next week</a>, now is a great time to jump into the original.</p></div><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227443"><div id="227443" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hollow Knight</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't really feel the need to say much about The Witcher 3, because of course it's worth playing. CD Projekt Red's masterpiece is one of those rare games that I've ended up playing through multiple times. While it's the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-books-reading-order">Witcher books</a> that ultimately birthed this franchise, it's really this game that made it a household name. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv">The Witcher 4</a> somewhere on the horizon, its as good a time as any to start your Witcher 3 journey for the first time.</p></div><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227445"><div id="227445" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a PC gamer who also happens to be a Nintendo gamer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bug-fables-the-everlasting-sapling">Bug Fables</a> is one of those games that hits a very specific sweet spot. It's a turn-based RPG that has an eerily similar look and feel as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/paper-mario">original Paper Mario game</a>. It's a storybook adventure with puzzles and battles that has a fun overarching story. If you love games like Paper Mario and Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, you'll love Bug Fables.</p></div><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227446"><div id="227446" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My last recommendation is the cheapest and shortest game on this list. Gris is a beautiful platformer game with some fun puzzles and stunning artwork. This game tells a story of grief and loss, and these feelings unfold through an incredible use of color, music, and gameplay. You can <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/62257" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">play through the whole thing in a few hours</a>, and it's definitely worth paying $2.99 for what you'll get from it. This is one of those games that hit me surprisingly hard.</p></div><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227447"><div id="227447" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gris</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">See all PC games on sale for under $10</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The games I've listed here are just some of my favorites, but there's actually a lot more in the sale that are worth a look. Humble Bundle has a specific page for all of the deals under $10 right now and it includes things like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-games-in-order">Batman: Arkham collection</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-games-in-order">Yakuza games</a>. </p></div><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227073"><div id="227073" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Humble Bundle Summer Sale</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Get an additional 20% off with a Humble Choice subscription.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to grab some console games at a discount, there are also a few <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/labor-day-sales-2025">other Labor Day sales</a> worth checking out.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With Battlefield 6’s open beta done and dusted and its October 10 release date in sight, developer DICE is prepping the shooter for launch across PC and console. But it is on PC specifically that EA's anti-cheat efforts have raised eyebrows, and even caused some fans to miss out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PC gamers who played the Battlefield 6 open beta might have run into the following on-screen warning: ‘Secure Boot is not enabled.’ Indeed, if you want to play Battlefield 6 on PC you have no choice but to enable Secure Boot. And based on the open beta, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-forces-pc-gamers-to-mess-about-with-their-bios-to-enable-secure-boot-and-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-next">some had trouble with it</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enabling Secure Boot involves tinkering with a part of a computer not all PC gamers will be instantly familiar with: the BIOS (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/How_to_Enable_Secure_Boot">check out IGN's guide for more</a>). There are things like TPM 2.0 (which must be turned on) to deal with, and you need to make sure your Windows disk is GPT and not MBR (not everyone will know what these are). All this before you can even enable Secure Boot — and then you may not be able to enable it anyway, which then means you need to refer to your manufacturer for guidance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While this won’t be a problem for more experienced PC gamers, it will be an intimidating process for some. And according to DICE, it knows these anti-cheat measures will prevent some people from playing Battlefield 6 at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-really-sucks-battlefield-6-technical-director-bummed-out-about-those-unable-to-play-due-to-secure-boot-requirement-believes-anti-cheat-cat-and-mouse-game-will-never-end" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a>, Battlefield 6 technical director Christian Buhl lamented the situation. "The fact is I wish we didn't have to do things like Secure Boot," Buhl said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It does prevent some players from playing the game. Some people's PCs can't handle it and they can't play; that really sucks. I wish everyone could play the game with low friction and not have to do these sorts of things."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/screenshot-2025-08-06-214819-1754555745386-1756471937073.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6 forces players to enable Secure Boot on PC.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Buhl sounds pleased with the effectiveness of the likes of Secure Boot, which are “some of the strongest tools in our toolbox to stop cheating.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were pretty happy with how the anti-cheat performed. Obviously I'll say we can never be perfect, anti-cheat is always a cat-and-mouse game where we're constantly going back and forth and keeping on top of what the cheaters are doing. But from the beginning this was something we put a high priority on, so when we launch this game we have a really strong anti-cheat program in place."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buhl continued: “Again, nothing makes cheating impossible, but enabling Secure Boot and having kernel-level access makes it so much harder to cheat and so much easier for us to find and stop cheating."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s no secret that cheating in competitive multiplayer games is a huge problem for publishers. Activision, for example, has spent millions trying to reverse the narrative for Call of Duty, and TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot are in place for Black Ops 7 on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Secure Boot caused some people problems, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-huge-queue-to-get-in-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-before-its-even-out"><u>the Battlefield 6 open beta enjoyed huge player numbers on Steam</u></a>, so it will be interesting to see how this goes at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
