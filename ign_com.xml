            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for Build A Boat For Treasure codes? We've got all the latest active codes for this Roblox experience, so you don't have to search for them yourself. Redeem each one for rewards like free items and gold to buy crates so you can build the best boat.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Working Build A Boat For Treasure Codes (July 2025)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are all the current active codes you can redeem in Build A Boat For Treasure, as well as the rewards you'll get from them:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>chillthrill709 was here</strong> - Firework</li><li><strong>=D</strong> - 5 gold</li><li><strong>hi</strong> - 5 gold</li><li><strong>=p</strong> - 5 gold</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Expired Build A Boat For Treasure Codes (July 2025)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The below codes have unfortunately expired and will no longer work. We've included them here so you don't try to redeem them:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Squid Army</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Redeem Build A Boat For Treasure Codes</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/build-a-boat-for-treasure-redeem-codes-1752798881076.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Understanding how to redeem codes in Build A Boat For Treasure is important if you want to take advantage of those rewards. Follow these simple steps to learn how to get them:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Launch Build A Boat For Treasure on Roblox</li><li><strong>Press the Menu button</strong> on the right side of your screen that shows a green chest.</li><li>Then, press <strong>the button with two cogwheels</strong> at the top of this new window.</li><li>Scroll down until you see the big "Redeem Code" section. If you scroll too far, you'll end up in the credits section listing contributors.</li><li>Finally, type your code into the "Code" box and click the big green "Redeem" button.</li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Isn't My Build A Boat For Treasure Code Working?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're having trouble redeeming a code, there are two common reasons why it may not be working:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The code is expired</li><li>The code has been entered incorrectly</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Boat For Treasure doesn't give you a lot of information when codes don't work. This can make it difficult to understand if it's one you've already redeemed or simply an expired code. However, if there's a typo or any other reason the code isn't functioning, the big green "Redeem" button will switch to a red one that says "Invalid".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In order to avoid codes showing up as invalid, we recommend <strong>copying and pasting the code directly from this article</strong>. As long as you don't accidentally get an extra space in there when copying it, it should work if it's active. We make sure to check and test every Build A Boat For Treasure code before we add them to this article.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Find More Build A Boat For Treasure Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best ways to find more codes is by bookmarking our page here so you can check back for when new codes are added. However, if you want to try and find some codes yourself, you can take a look at the Build A Boat For Treasure <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ZTQEcX7UnU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated Discord server</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Build A Boat For Treasure in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Boat For Treasure focuses on almost exactly what the name of the game tells you. Your goal is to build a boat block by clock so you can travel farther down a river. While that may sound simple, it’s actually tougher than you'd think. This is because there are all sorts of obstacles that can get in your way and destroy your ship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll need to carefully sail around barriers or prepare to ram through them if you have enough ship to do so. Just be careful of flying baseballs and other projectiles that can bounce you into the air. As you get farther, you'll earn more gold that you can then buy more parts with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jeffrey Lerman is a freelance game journalist for IGN who has been covering games for over a decade.

He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Osbourne, also known as music’s Prince of Darkness, is known for shaping the metal world with his unique vocal and songwriting skills. He truly broke into the music scene as the lead vocalist in Black Sabbath, a pioneering ‘70s group known for projects like 1970’s Paranoid and 1971’s Masters of Reality. Even as the band remained through to the 2000s, Osbourne would go on to release his own solo projects, including 1980’s Blizzard of Ozz and 1991’s No More Tears.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to overstate Osbourne’s impact on rock, metal, and music in general, but he’s known for more than his legendary Crazy Train laugh. TV watchers were thrown for a loop in 2002 with The Osbournes, a reality show that featured Ozzy Osbourne, Sharon Osbourne, Kelly Osbourne, and Jack Osbourne. It ran for four seasons and 52 episodes before coming to an end in 2005.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning.

He’s lent his voice to South Park and, more recently, Trolls World Tour in the past, and he even made cameo appearances in films like Ghostbusters (2016), Austin Powers in Goldmember, and Little Nicky.

It was meant to serve as a farewell show dedicated to the mark Osbourne left on music as he continued to struggle with Parkinson’s disease and other health complications. All proceeds generated from the concert were donated equally between Cure Parkinson’s, Birmingham Children’s Hospital, and Acorn Children’s Hospice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans and fellow musicians from across the globe have already taken to social media to talk about what Osbourne’s music meant to them.
