            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-reportedly-making-both-a-steam-controller-2-and-a-new-vr-controller<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve is reportedly working on a sequel to its original Steam Controller, <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1858925211363553316" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to an insider report</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per YouTuber Brad Lynch, a Steam Controller 2 codenamed "Ibex" is in the works, and en route to mass production. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Codename for Steam Controller 2 is “Ibex”</p><p>Separate product from Deckard’s “Roy” controller(s)</p><p>Both are being tooled for a mass production goal in their factories right now. That’s why I know they’re in later stages of productization</p></div>— Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1858925211363553316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 19, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">We don't have too many details on controller specifics, but Lynch did say in replies on X/Twitter that it will look like a standard gamepad. The biggest change is reportedly the shape and size of the trackpads "to get into that gamepad-y form." It will also allegedly have symmetrical sticks.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/07/24/valve-steam-controller-redesign8000cinema12800jpg-8dd5b8.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Valve's Steam controller.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Lynch said Valve seems to be working on a new VR controller also for mass production, codenamed "Roy." Roy is apparently referenced in Valve's SteamVR code, and would supposedly be a wand-shaped companion to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-stream-deckard-standalone-vr-headset-rumor">rumored wireless "Deckard" headset</a> that's also reportedly in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roy would reportedly double as a Steam Controller gamepad when not being used with VR, including a D-pad, shoulder buttons, and a set of ABXY buttons for more traditional gameplay in addition to its motion and VR functionality.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Valve Roy controller(s) have at least: DPAD, Bumpers, Grip Buttons, Triggers, ABXY, system button, and some sort of strap</p><p>I am confident in this info based on datamining AND sources who wished not to be named</p><p>There is also an unreleased OpenXR extension for these controllers <a href="https://t.co/36WBtLvYZ5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/36WBtLvYZ5</a></p></div>— Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1857153531897131182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 14, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">While it's unclear when either of these products will be in our hands, Lynch alluded in one post that it's unlikely Deckard specifically is a holiday 2024 release. The headset has allegedly been in the works for some time and was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-stream-deckard-standalone-vr-headset-rumor">first reported on in 2021</a>. Though Valve already released one VR headset in 2019, the Index, it requires multiple base station sensors and connection to a PC. Deckard allegedly would be standalone, more akin to a Meta Quest headset, making it a more accessible (and theoretically more affordable) option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Steam Controller 2, while we're still short on details, fans are hopeful its control scheme and customizability will be reminiscent of the Steam Deck handheld, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-oled-review">got a fancier OLED model just last year</a>. IGN has reached out to Valve for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social.

But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have gone down the patent route. They want 5 million yen (approx $32,846) each plus late payment damages, as well as an injunction against Palworld that would block its release.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld vs. Pokémon Comparison</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld <em>does</em> include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, similar to the mechanic seen in the 2022 Nintendo Switch exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>.
