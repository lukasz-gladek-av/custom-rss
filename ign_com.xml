We’re still waiting for more information about what’s in each, but we’ll update this page as we hear more. <strong>Any you’ve got your eye on? Let us know in the comments!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are four Commander Decks for the Marvel Super Heroes set, following in the footsteps of other Universes Beyond sets like The Lord of the Rings, Warhammer 40,000, and last year’s Final Fantasy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the lineup, including the brief description on the box of each precon, as well as their color identity.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Avengers Assemble (Captain America and Nick Fury - Red/White/Blue)<ul data-cy="list"><li>‘Grow your ranks, equipment and counters’</li></ul></li><li>Wakanda Forever (Black Panther - Green/White)<ul data-cy="list"><li>‘Power up with artifacts, reign as the Monarch’</li></ul></li><li>The Fantastic Four (The titular team - Red/Green/White/Blue)<ul data-cy="list"><li>‘Noncreature spells, protection fields’</li></ul></li><li>Doom Prevails (Doctor Doom and Loki - Blue/Black/Red)<ul data-cy="list"><li>‘Connive for power, drain life’</li></ul></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Marvel’s Spider-Man, which launched in 2025, didn’t get the Commander Deck treatment. Given it’s Magic’s most popular format, we’re unsure if this is Wizards of the Coast correcting that oversight, or if it was always planned this way.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What's in the Collector's Edition Commander Decks?</h2><div id="234835"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234835" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Marvel Super Heroes - Collector's Edition Commander Deck Bundle</h3></p></div></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm glad you asked!
