            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/clair-obscur-expedition-33"><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></a> has officially been named Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2025, alongside multiple other wins. If that winning sweep has you jumping in for the first time (or returning for another playthrough), IGN has you covered with guides, explainers, and wikis to help you get started for your journey across The Continent.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Clair Obscur: Expedition 33? Should You Play It?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a turn-based RPG (it's kind of like Final Fantasy VII... <em>kind of</em>) set in the world of The Continent. It follows a group called Expedition 33 on a mission to destroy The Paintress, a mysterious figure who wipes out anyone over a certain age in a yearly ceremony called the "Gommage." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside extremely unique turn-based combat, which emphasizes various skills and parries to deal damage to bosses with "tells" and plenty of secret weak points, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/clair-obscur-expedition-33/Characters"><strong>you and your party</strong></a> explore various different areas, encountering enemies, finding treasure, and discovering what happened to other Expeditions that ventured out to beat the Paintress - and failed - before. You also can also build your team to deal ridiculous combo-based damage, something that hardcore players have come to love about Expedition 33. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're an RPG fan but don't have time to sink 100+ hours into them, Expedition 33 may be <em>perfect</em> for you. If you solely focus on the main story, you can expect to roll credits in around 28 hours. With side quests, this increases to 45 hours. If you're set on completing <em>everything</em>, it'll take roughly 65 hours. And if you want to beat a bunch of optional bosses with crazy builds, you can do that, too. Oh and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">we gave Expedition 33 a great score in our review </a>if you want a more in-depth take!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/23/doesnt-tell-you-site-1745450875713.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">How Combat Works in Expedition 33</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned previously, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 features turn-based combat, which means that everyone in battle, including enemies, attacks one at a time, rather than everyone at once - think classic Final Fantasy, Persona, or Baldur's Gate 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You don't just wait for enemy attacks to hit you, though. Here, one of the main selling points is the ability to parry, dodge, and jump to avoid and counter attacks. When an opponent uses a move, you're able to press a button that, when timed right, either dodges, jumps, or parries to avoid damage completely or deal damage back to them. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/expedition-33-combar-1765568222438.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to your own skills, these are powered by Pictos and Luminas. Pictos are special pieces of equipment that you equip to characters to grant special benefits and increase stats. Luminas, working hand-in-hand with Pictos, are special skills that unlock after you've won a battle with a Picto four times, and can be carried over and used with every member of your party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Builds are a crucial part of combat in Expedition 33, and you'll need to pay mind to not only your Pictos and Luminas, but weapons and attributes. No matter the character, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/clair-obscur-expedition-33/Expedition_33_Builds"><strong>we've got Build Guides</strong></a> to help you plan, so you're always suited up in the best gear and stats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If all this sounds confusing or overwhelming to you, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/clair-obscur-expedition-33/Combat_Guide"><strong>head to our Combat Guide</strong></a> that explains everything you need to know about Expedition 33's battle system in more detail, including the more intricate mechanics we haven't covered here.
