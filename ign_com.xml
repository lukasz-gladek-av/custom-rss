Things kicked off early in the year with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-2-black-review">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>, a new version of the beloved classic brought to modern platforms with enhanced visuals. Later on, we got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>, a 2D sidescroller from The Game Kitchen. However, perhaps nothing was more exciting than Ninja Gaiden 4, the long-awaited follow-up to Ninja Gaiden 3. If you haven't had a chance to check out this brand-new entry, you can pick up a copy for $49.99 today at Walmart.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ninja Gaiden 4 for $49.99 at Walmart</h2><div catalogid="7de6b1c9-b1ee-4cce-85de-f7d01c07f650" id="233872"><div id="233872" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>NINJA GAIDEN 4 – PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Gaiden 4 was developed by both Team Ninja and PlatinumGames, offering a wild and immensely satisfying action combat system. Instead of solely focusing on Ryu, a new protagonist, Yakumo, was introduced alongside him. With two characters to play as, there are all kinds of new abilities and mechanics to utilize as you trek across Tokyo to combat an evil threat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-review">In our 8/10 review</a>, we wrote, "When it comes to combat, there are few games I’d consider to even be in the same ballpark as Ninja Gaiden 4. It is quite simply the most fun I’ve had with a 3D action game since Devil May Cry 5. Its disappointing story, bland level design, and uneven boss battles certainly put a damper on the package as a whole, but they haven’t stopped me from continuously coming back for more all the same. Blemishes and all, this is the best pure action game since Hi-Fi Rush, and hopefully it doesn’t take another 13 years for the next one."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.
