            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It looks like Bethesda has begun teasing new content for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a>, after fans spotted a hidden message in a social media video released to celebrate the game‚Äôs two-year anniversary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video, below, starts off innocently enough, but soon the tone of the music shifts and the image becomes garbled. Clearly, there‚Äôs a tease in there somewhere!</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Celebrating two incredible years in the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Starfield?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Starfield</a>. üåå</p><p>Thank you to everyone who has explored the Settled Systems with us. We look forward to the adventures yet to come. <a href="https://t.co/AeWN8DVlO2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/AeWN8DVlO2</a></p></div>‚Äî Starfield (@StarfieldGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/StarfieldGame/status/1963980745728229522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">And indeed there is. It didn‚Äôt take long for Starfield fans to arrange the frames in such a way to form the words ‚ÄòTerran Armada,‚Äô which has sent the game‚Äôs community down a rabbit hole of speculation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for Starfield follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most obvious suggestion is Terran Armada is the name of Starfield‚Äôs long-awaited second expansion. If so, it suggests a DLC that revolves around Earth, people who left Earth, or people who still are on Earth. Some are speculating that Terran Armada, if this does in fact relate to DLC, will be about the return ships that left Earth at some point in the past, perhaps a fleet of generation ships. Another popular theory is that the Terrans are the name of a new enemy faction of survivors left on Earth after its destruction, which could evoke Mad Max vibes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Starfield, Earth became a barren, uninhabitable wasteland after its magnetosphere collapsed in 2203, leading to the dissipation of its atmosphere and the evacuation of humanity. The collapse was a direct consequence of the invention and widespread use of the Grav Drive, a technology enabling faster-than-light travel. The planet is now exposed to dangerous solar and cosmic radiation and is covered in toxic vents and impact craters, with no signs of life.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Or perhaps Terran Armada isn‚Äôt DLC 2 after all, and instead is a stop-gap update designed to tide fans over until the promised second expansion finally materializes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever this is, clearly Starfield fans who have stuck with the game since its launch in 2023 are chomping at the bit. Apart from vague words of reassurance, Bethesda has remained tight-lipped on the future of Starfield, only recently teasing improvements to space travel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe've waited 11 months for a three-second screen that changed colors and revealed a few letters of a broken up word (and we're probably gonna have to wait another 4-6 months for anything more),‚Äù <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1na14cn/comment/ncqt0fm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Elkupalos</a>. ‚ÄúWe're beyond starved at this point haha. Next trailer or update of actual substance is gonna hit us fans like a nuke.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/following-datamine-leak-bethesda-confirms-starfield-space-gameplay-revamp-to-make-the-travels-there-more-rewarding">Bethesda confirmed improvements to Starfield space gameplay ‚Äúto make the travels there more rewarding‚Äù</a> after datamined fragments of code suggested the developer had a more streamlined space travel experience in the works. Based on this datamine, while you may be able to travel between planets within the same system, you won‚Äôt be able to fly all the way between systems, nor fly directly from a planet's surface into orbit, like No Man's Sky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new video discussing his career, veteran Bethesda developer Tim Lamb confirmed that the studio had been working on Starfield‚Äôs space gameplay, and that a new DLC story was still coming at some point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúI think as it comes to Starfield, I'm really excited for players to see what the teams have been working on,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have some cool stuff coming, including free updates and features the players have been asking for, as well as a new DLC story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúI can't go into all the details just yet, but I will say part of the team has been focused on space gameplay to make the travels there more rewarding. We're also adding some new game systems, and a few other smaller delights. There's also some really interesting stuff coming down the pipe from our verified creators. There's some fun stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúI just want to say thanks. We really appreciate the support and the enthusiasm. We can't wait to get it into the hands of our players.‚Äù</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-reportedly-set-for-ps5-release-during-spring-2026-alongside-new-expansion"><u>Starfield's second expansion and much-anticipated PlayStation 5 port would now arrive in 2026</u></a>, following the poor reception to 2024 add-on Shattered Space. Bethesda boss Todd Howard had <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>previously talked of expansions arriving annually</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda‚Äôs first brand new IP in 25 years, but it was not as well received as the studio‚Äôs previous games in the Fallout and The Elder Scrolls franchises, and the Shattered Space expansion, released a year later in September 2024, has a ‚Äòmostly negative‚Äô user review rating on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield went on to reach 15 million players, but the question of whether Bethesda might walk away from the game to focus on its other franchises has been a running theme since release. In June 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2"><u>Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supporting Starfield</u></a>, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would come out following Shattered Space. And in an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Bethesda Game Studios‚Äô Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for ‚Äúhopefully a very long time.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

In addition to providing his perspective on the company‚Äôs early days, he took the time to recount how some of its biggest victories and hardest falls helped shape it into what it is today.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When it was working, it was magical.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hines started with Bethesda in October 1999, seeing it through everything from the launch of The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind in 2002, to Skyrim in 2011, to Fallout 76 in 2018. He also remained as a key figure at the gaming publisher throughout Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media, which was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-zenimax-acquisition-officially-complete-bethesda-now-a-part-of-xbox"><u>completed in 2021</u></a>, before going on to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesdas-pete-hines-announces-retirement"><u>announce his retirement in 2023</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hines brought his time at Bethesda to an end after 24 years. However, it seems it was the quieter moments working with ZeniMax founder and CEO Robert Altman, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robert-a-altman-zenimax-founder-and-ceo-dies"><u>passed away in 2021</u></a>, that he remembers most fondly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúIt was Robert Altman's company, and we were his employees, no question,‚Äù Hines said. ‚ÄúBut he treated us more like family, and we found a culture that really fit us. When it was working, it was magical. We were a small, private company. It's way easier to stay out of scrutiny when you're not having to put your earnings reports out for the whole world.‚Äù</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda, which now serves under the titan that is Microsoft, encompasses a variety of different game studios. This includes its development arm, Bethesda Game Studios, Doom developer id Software, Deathloop developer Arkane Studios, Wolfenstein studio MachineGames, and The Elder Scrolls Online studio ZeniMax Online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gamers have turned to the company for everything from giant, trend-setting RPGs to laser-focused first-person shooters, but in 2024, the Bethesda umbrella shrunk. Just three years after Microsoft completed its acquisition, the Xbox company announced it would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shock-and-anger-as-xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-more"><u>shutting down Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush studio Tango Gameworks</u></a> (Tango was later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/krafton-says-it-didnt-buy-tango-gameworks-from-microsoft-for-profit-we-dont-think-hi-fi-rush-2-is-going-to-make-us-money"><u>acquired by Krafton</u></a>).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's just no question that the company is not the same.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda has gone through major shifts both before and after the Microsoft acquisition. For better or worse, Hines says there‚Äôs no denying the company he started at in 1999 has changed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúThere's just no question that the company is not the same,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIt has been radically changed and altered from the company that we built. It is what it is. Things change. Things move on, but at its height, it was really a special thing to be a part of.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in the interview with Hines, the former Bethesda executive touched on how he <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pete-hines-comments-on-the-confusion-surrounding-how-bethesda-named-prey-2017-dont-even-get-me-started?_cache=pass"><u>fought to change the name of Arkane‚Äôs Prey</u></a>, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bethesda-exec-says-gaming-subscription-services-worth-jack-s-without-proper-support-for-game-developers"><u>his thoughts on gaming subscription services like Game Pass</u></a>. He also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-76-pete-hines-remembers-probably-the-dumbest-thing-he-did-at-bethesda"><u>remembered the controversy surrounding Fallout 76</u></a> and how it led to ‚Äúprobably the dumbest thing‚Äù he ever did at Bethesda.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, you can read about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-game-studios-microsoft-game-studios"><u>how Bethesda became the first Microsoft game studio to fully unionize</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines 2</a> publisher Paradox is now offering PlayStation Store pre-order refunds as it makes ‚Äúbig changes‚Äù after a backlash to its decision to lock clans behind DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The furore began with the confirmation that Bloodlines 2 would feature four clans: Brujah; Tremere; Banu Haqim; and Ventrue. While this selection provides four different starting options for how you build your protagonist, it‚Äôs a more limited offering compared to the cult classic original Bloodlines, which featured seven clans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer The Chinese Room added a further two clans to Bloodlines 2 (Lasombra and Toreador), but these were only available as part of the Shadows and Silk add-on pack, which costs $21.99 as DLC, or included as part of the $89.99 Premium Edition. The standard edition costs $59.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This DLC is available from day one, which has created the impression that the ‚Äúfull‚Äù roster has been carved up, with only those paying extra getting the complete launch experience. As you‚Äôd expect, fans were quick to express their dissatisfaction.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At gamescom 2025, a representative for publisher Paradox told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-has-two-clans-locked-behind-dlc-because-of-business"><u>the decision was a ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù informed choice</u></a>, prompting further outcry. Then, last month, a post on Discord from Paradox suggested a significant change would be coming ahead of launch, and now the publisher has gone one step further by issuing PlayStation Store pre-order refunds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúHi,‚Äù <a href="https://x.com/VtM_Bloodlines/status/1964016313958838399" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on social media on the official Bloodlines 2 account began</a>. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre making adjustments and will share the details on Sept 17. Big changes take time, and we want to do this right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúPS Store pre-orders will be refunded on Sept 8. You‚Äôll be able to pre-order again before launch on Oct 21.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúThanks for your patience; we‚Äôll share more soon!‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are now wondering whether Paradox will include Lasombra and Toreador by default and not as DLC at base game price. Certainly, the sentiment online is that‚Äôs the expectation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúHonestly nothing short of fully including them at base game price will turn me around on this,‚Äù <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bringdownthesky.bsky.social/post/3ly47xynyyk2z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said one social media user</a> in response to the announcement. ‚ÄúOtherwise I'm skipping.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúThe only way to salvage this and regain trust with the community is to sell the base game as-is with all clans available and rather sell DLC with new side stories and cosmetics on the side or just add the cosmetics/side stories as part of a higher tier eg deluxe edition/premium edition, as that won't mess with the main story/narrative etc,‚Äù <a href="https://x.com/SplashbangOW/status/1964040019204809157" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said another</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some expressed thanks for the reaction to the backlash. ‚ÄúI'm very excited and hopeful to see what you came up with for the two clans locked behind DLC issue,‚Äù <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kixieboo.bsky.social/post/3ly4xxtqfbc2g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said one fan</a>. ‚ÄúI'd like to thank you for listening to community feedback and working to fix the issue. I'm sure refunding store pre-orders was not an easy decision.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines 2 has suffered a difficult development and a number of high-profile delays, but it is a crucial release for Paradox. The publisher will be keen to give it the best chance possible to succeed, and backtracking on its DLC plans may be the only viable option at this stage.

It‚Äôs a way to expand TFT‚Äôs core mechanics while giving players new stories to create with every climb.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Teamfight Tactics: Ao Shin‚Äôs Ascent launches on September 24 at 10am Pacific Time, shortly after the release of patch 15.5. The mode will be available until the end of patch 15.6 on October 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Director Tetsuya Nomura has heard the cries for updates on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iv"><u>Kingdom Hearts 4</u></a>, and he‚Äôs happy to report that development is ‚Äúprogressing really smoothly.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs a largely inconsequential but still welcome update for two of Square Enix‚Äôs most anticipated games that arrived during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeOWfNAuVUk&amp;t=6796s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the recent Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis second anniversary broadcast</u></a>. As reported on and translated by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-three-and-kingdom-hearts-iv-development-progressing-smoothly-tetsuya-nomura-confirms" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Gematsu</u></a>, Nomura took the opportunity to address waves of comments from fans hoping to see the team make an announcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúApparently, [co-director Motomu] Toriyama mentioned in an interview that something might be released around the second anniversary [of <em>Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis</em>],‚Äù Nomura said when addressing comments specifically related to the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs probably where those expectations are coming from. Right, so things are progressing really smoothly. I can‚Äôt really say more ‚Äî if I suddenly went, ‚ÄòWell, actually...,‚Äô everyone would be really surprised! [Laughs.]‚Äù</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nomura goes as far as to say that the ‚Äúrelease timing has already been decided‚Äù but stops short of clarifying when exactly Square Enix will share more. For now, he asks fans to be patient, adding that work on Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 is ‚Äúmoving forward according to that schedule.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RPG fans have been on the hunt for news about the next entry in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series since its last installment, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a>, launched in early 2024. We know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-in-development"><u>development started as early as June 2022</u></a>, with Square Enix saying last year that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-hoping-to-release-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-finale-by-2027"><u>its goal is to see it launch by 2027</u></a>. Excitement for the third and final chapter in the trilogy grew even more when the team revealed that it had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-a-completed-story-at-square-enix"><u>completed its story earlier this year</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Development for Kingdom Hearts 4, meanwhile, is progressing in a similarly positive direction, though Nomura says even less about when any further updates may arrive on this front.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúAnd this has also come up in the comments here and there,‚Äù Nomura added, ‚Äúbut <em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em> is likewise steadily moving forward according to schedule, so please look forward to it.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingdom Hearts 4 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-and-kingdom-hearts-missing-link-announced-at-the-series-20th-anniversary-event"><u>announced in 2022</u></a>, and updates have been distressingly few and far between since. It wasn‚Äôt until May 2025, not even four months ago, that Square Enix was willing to share a substantial update, and even then, all fans had to hold onto was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-finally-breaks-silence-on-kingdom-hearts-4-shares-screenshots-says-its-dedicated-to-making-this-an-experience-that-lives-up-to-your-expectations"><u>a handful of new screenshots</u></a> and <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1922819231965696436" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a short message from the team</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Hearts 4 Screenshots May 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen how excited you are, and we are truly grateful from the bottom of our hearts," Square Enix said at the time. ‚ÄúWe are equally excited and can‚Äôt wait to share more about Kingdom Hearts IV when the time is right. Until then, we appreciate your patience.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There‚Äôs no telling when exactly we can expect to hear any additional updates on Kingdom Hearts 4 or Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3.
