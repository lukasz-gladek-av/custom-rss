Item boxes will now take slightly less time to refresh, also.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who do enjoy the game's open world, improvements have been made there, too. Nintendo has added the locations of previously-found P Switches and Peach Medallions to the map for easier tracking, and you can now warp to P Switches if you want to go replay them. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These latest changes to the frequency of lap-based courses follow an earlier U-turn by Nintendo after it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-upset-over-mario-kart-world-patch-that-makes-a-big-change-to-online-play-thanks-i-hate-it">initially made it harder to encounter traditional three-lap Mario Kart tracks</a>. The move was criticised by fans, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-u-turns-on-mario-kart-world-change-that-forced-more-open-world-driving-as-it-increases-chance-of-lap-type-races">later reversed in July's patch</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Sega began promoting its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-mocks-mario-kart-world-and-its-dull-open-world-in-sonic-racing-crossworlds-trailer">rival kart racer Sonic Racing: Crossworlds with a cheeky trailer</a> that poked fun at Mario Kart World's dull open world. Maybe Nintendo noticed?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other tweaks include the ability to join friends in Knockout Tour, and encounter UFOs more easily in Free Roam. Nintendo's full patch notes for the update, which brings the game to version 1.3.0, lie below:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mario Kart World Ver. 1.3.0 patch notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>General</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>You can now join friends playing "Knockout Tour" by selecting "Friends" from "Online Play" "1p."</li><li>Up to 2 players can now play "Free Roam" while waiting if the game was full when trying to join friends playing "Race," "Knockout Tour" or "Battle" in "Online Play."</li><li>The "Free Roam" map now displays the locations of P Switches you've run over and Peach Medallions you've obtained.<ul data-cy="list"><li>You can now select a P Switch from the map and move to a location near the P Switch.</li></ul></li><li>In "Free Roam", you can now transform into the character pulled into the UFO.<ul data-cy="list"><li>If "Dash Food" in "Settings/Controller" is set to "Doesn’t transform" then you will not transform.</li></ul></li><li>It is now easier to encounter UFOs in "Free Roam."</li><li>The conditions for the appearance of some Peach Medallions in "Free Roam" have been adjusted.</li><li>When spectating in "Knockout Tour" or "Balloon Battle" in "Online Play" or "Wireless Play", you can now choose who to watch, even if you are holding the Joy-Con 2 or Joy-Con horizontally.</li><li>Decreased the time between when an item box is taken by someone and the next time it is revived.</li><li>Increased the invincible time after spinning or crashing during a race.</li><li>Reduced the force of jumps when landing on a rival from above.</li><li>Decreased the amount of time between when you finish and when spectating begins in "Knockout Tour" or "Balloon Battle" in "Online Play" or "Wireless Play."</li><li>Decreased the amount of time between passing through the checkpoint and when the ranking is displayed in "Knockout Tour" in "Wireless Play" and "LAN Play."</li><li>Further increased the frequency of lap-type courses appearing in the selection when choosing the next course in "VS Race" and wireless races.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue in "Online Play" and "Wireless Play" where the ranking would sometimes become incorrect if a player went off course at the same time as reaching the finish line.</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Grand Prix", "Knockout Tour", and "VS Race", where the CPU's ranking would sometimes drop after reaching the finish line.</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Knockout Tour" in "Online Play" where other players' ratings would sometimes appear as "0" on the results screen.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a Spiny Shell would sometimes pass the first place player in "Wireless Play" or "Online Play."</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes be sent flying backwards a great distance when hit by a Spiny Shell.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the second item in an item slot would sometimes not disappear when hit by Lightning.</li><li>Fixed an issue where hitting the base of a pillar in mid-air would sometimes cause a large jump.</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused movement to become unstable when doing a wall ride on water.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes be swept away strongly after landing when doing a mini jump while going up a river.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes pass through the ground when hit by a car driving on the road.</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Free Roam" where players would sometimes be unable to enter pipes correctly after exiting a trailer.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the results screen would sometimes become distorted after spectating "Balloon Battle" in "Online Play."</li><li>Fixed an issue where the game would sometimes not proceed to the course selection screen after exiting a pipe during "Free Roam" in "Online Play."</li><li>Fixed an issue where Bullet Bill would sometimes slip through walls when used in "Sky-High Sundae."</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes get stuck on a wall at the start of the race heading from "Airship Fortress" to "Shy Guy Bazaar."</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes get stuck in walls when using a Bullet Bill in "Bowser’s Castle."</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Cheep Cheep Falls" where item boxes were sometimes difficult to pick up when Smart Steering was turned on.</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Knockout Tour" "Spiny Rally" where sometimes there was an item box buried in the ground.</li><li>Several other issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We do not take this decision lightly."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has delayed the Nintendo Switch 2 version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> indefinitely and cancelled all digital pre-orders just over a week from its release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The looter shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-will-launch-on-nintendo-switch-2-on-october-3">had been due out on Nintendo’s new console on October 3</a>. Gearbox failed to share an updated release date in its announcement. Here's Gearbox chief Randy Pitchford's Borderlands 4 Nintendo Switch 2 release date announcement video, released in July.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">An important message regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4: <a href="https://t.co/Wc5MwAU2bm" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Wc5MwAU2bm</a></p>— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1947702377185763768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The delay decision comes at a time when Gearbox is already working to fix performance issues with Borderlands 4 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. For example, last week the tech experts at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a> confirmed a gradual worsening of framerate with continuous playtime, even on the more powerful PlayStation 5 Pro and Xbox Series X. As revealed in <a href="https://youtu.be/kRWW6qwjFBA?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a video published to YouTube</u></a>, Digital Foundry found performance starts dipping after around 30 minutes to an hour, which it called "too intrusive on the overall experience, too regular an interruption." Even after a completely fresh boot, the game is still prone to framerate drops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Borderlands 4 is still on a mixed Steam review rating, with most of the negative comments revolving around PC performance. Digital Foundry has said its <a href="https://youtu.be/2v1ST5qMoaY?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>initial analysis of Borderlands 4 on PC</u></a> shows significant stutter problems, and have advised against running the game on its ‘Badass’ graphics setting, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-borderlands-4-on-pc-runs-worse-than-usual-for-an-unreal-engine-5-game-advise-against-badass-setting"><u>which suggests there are indeed problems with the Unreal Engine 5 title</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this in mind, it’s hard to imagine Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 running smoothly.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Greetings, Vault Hunters,” Gearbox’s statement began. “We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed. We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that. Our hope is to also better align this release with the addition of cross saves, which we are working on and recognize is very important. We will update you all on the new release timing once we’ve fully adjusted our plans.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio said that “in accordance with Nintendo’s policy,” all digital pre-orders to date will be cancelled. “We greatly appreciate the feedback, support and patience of our fans and community. It’s truly what keeps us going.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was a distinct lack of surprise at the announcement from fans. "The game has trouble on my 4080 super, I can’t imagine how the Switch version would fare," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1noywo2/comment/nfw57fm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Bitemarkz</a>. "I dont expect the Switch 2 version to ever run well, but I do respect the decision to delay it to avoid a complete disaster of a launch," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1noywo2/comment/nfvdaln/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commented jwhudexnls</a>. "BL4 brings top of the line desktop PCs to their knees, there's no way in hell whatever flavor of NVidia Tegra is inside the switch 2 can even launch the game," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1noywo2/comment/nfve8xk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added HoboG0blin</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a similar reaction over on social media. "Given how it performs now it would run at either 5 fps on the Switch 2 or turn into a Torgue device that explodes when attempting to run the game," said <a href="https://x.com/Raumentonus/status/1970625040996606256" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Raumentonus</a>. "Assumed as much, why did we push up the release date in general?" <a href="https://x.com/atomick/status/1970609381189525938" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wondered @atomick</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Greetings, Vault Hunters - We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Popular <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v"><u>Grand Theft Auto 5</u></a> roleplay server nopixel is collaborating with Rockstar Games for an official “evolution” of the RP service called nopixel V.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://x.com/nopixeltweets/status/1970518528932380749" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nopixel X/Twitter account</a> confirmed the news today with a trailer teasing Rockstar-backed roleplay support for GTA 5. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>Grand Theft Auto 6</u></a> on the horizon, Rockstar’s continued interest in the RP community has fans hoping for nopixel servers on console versions of past and future GTA games.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re excited to support the nopixel team as they create the future of GTA RP. <a href="https://t.co/pyb9SzfrfZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/pyb9SzfrfZ</a></p>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1970518900287721679?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Nopixel 1.0 launched in 2016, three years after GTA 5’s original release date, as a PC server where players can immerse themselves within the world of Los Santos by roleplaying as everything from taxi drivers and EMS to police officers. Various updates have arrived for the massively popular roleplay offshoot in the years since, but nopixel V marks the team’s first official collaboration with Rockstar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not quite clear what exactly nopixel V is. The announcement itself promises to bring its updated take on GTA 5 RP to the Rockstar Games Launcher and other PC platforms “soon,” pointing fans to <a href="https://www.nopixel.net/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>its website</u></a> for more news and to sign up for invitations.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A roster of content creators confirmed to be involved in nopixel V is also <a href="https://www.nopixel.net/roster" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available on its website</a> and includes names like Valkyrae and Pokimane. More names will be unveiled in the near future, with the next announcement tied to a countdown that ends in one week. While there's still much about nopixel V to be revealed, official presence on the Rockstar Games Launcher and other PC platforms is still a significant change.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, those eager to play GTA 6 had begun speculating about what Rockstar RP servers would look like when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-officially-working-with-gta-roleplay-server-team-sparking-fresh-excitement-about-gta-6"><u>the company announced it was working with the FiveM and RedM team at Cfx.re back in 2023</u></a>. That excitement then only increased when popular musician Faheem Rashad Najm a.k.a. T-Pain teased in 2024 that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/t-pain-confirms-hes-working-on-gta-6-gta-5-nopixel"><u>he was working on GTA 6</u></a> but had been asked by Rockstar to stop engaging with RP servers like nopixel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I used to be on nopixel, then I started working on GTA 6, and they told me I couldn't do RP anymore because it kind of goes against... they had this whole speech, like, 'What if somebody took your album and re-recorded it, and more people were listening to that,' and I'm like, 'Okay, I kind of get that, but I was having a good time. Alright that's fine,'" T-Pain said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with Rockstar doubling down on its support for fan-driven RP servers, some believe it’s only a matter of time before the company announces roleplay support in GTA 5 on consoles, or even for GTA 6. However, Rockstar has yet to announce plans for this kind of support.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">GTA 6 should have roleplay on Consoles 👀</p>— Synth Potato🥔 (@SynthPotato) <a href="https://twitter.com/SynthPotato/status/1970519280299991152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">it's for GTA 6 too but i can't prove it <a href="https://t.co/07k8ETC7HU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/07k8ETC7HU</a></p>— _Seven_🍀🌊🐊🐉 (@Seven97490) <a href="https://twitter.com/Seven97490/status/1970520834788991278?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll know more about Rockstar’s GTA RP plans when more information about nopixel V is revealed.
