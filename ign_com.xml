            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-reportedly-exits-bioware<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">With the studio focused on Mass Effect 5.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> director Corinne Busche is reportedly leaving EA-owned BioWare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-game-director-leaving-bioware" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> reported that Busche, who was game director on Dragon Age: The Veilguard from February 2022 to its launch last year, is set to leave the studio in the coming weeks. IGN has asked EA for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There have been questions over Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s success ever since its release in October last year. Eurogamer reported that while Busche is leaving the studio, it is otherwise unaffected by any other changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Busche joined BioWare in 2019 after a stint at Maxis, where she helped design the systems on various The Sims projects. As part of IGN’s article, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade">‘How BioWare Finally Got Dragon Age to the Finish Line After a Tumultuous Decade,’</a> we detailed the game’s near decade-long development, which included a major reset that saw it shift from the skeleton of a multiplayer game with repeatable quests, a tech base, and the outline of a story, to a full-blown single-player RPG. Busche, as director, helped get Dragon Age: The Veilguard over the line during its final few years of development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eurogamer reports that Busche's exit from BioWare is unrelated to Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s commercial performance. EA has yet to say whether sales and revenue met or exceeded expectations. The company is expected to report its Q3 2025 financial results on February 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5">BioWare has confirmed it has no plans for Dragon Age: The Veilguard DLC</a>. Rather it has turned its attention to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-next-chapter">Mass Effect 5</a>, which the studio has teased at various points over the years but is yet to properly reveal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In August 2023, coincidentally the same month that Larian’s all-conquering Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPG Baldur’s Gate 3 released, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs"><u>BioWare laid off around 50 workers</u></a>, including longtime veterans like narrative designer Mary Kirby, who had been with BioWare since Dragon Age’s inception.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At a higher level, the layoffs came amid an internal shakeup at EA that effectively resulted in it being split into sports and everything else. That summer, rumors spread within BioWare that it was about to be acquired. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-old-republic-development-third-party-bioware"><u>Star Wars: The Old Republic was allowed to go third-party</u></a>, ostensibly so that BioWare could focus on Mass Effect and Dragon Age.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioWare’s rollercoaster ride continued through Dragon Age’s reveal in 2024. Reactions to the initial reveal trailer were negative, sending the studio scrambling to release an early gameplay tease just days later to placate fans. The name change from Dreadwolf to The Veilguard wasn’t particularly well-received either. After that, though, impressions were generally positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Age fans are now left wondering, will BioWare be given the chance to follow up The Veilguard with another Dragon Age sequel?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

"We said this place would be full again," it began. "Thanks to our players, athletes, and fans for filling the house with us. Let’s keep that kick off energy going ‘til College Football 26 drops this summer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA Sports didn't reveal the cover stars, a specific release date, or any other details, though as College Football 25 arrived in July last year, it likely won't be long before fans find out more.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We said this place would be full again – thanks to our players, athletes, and fans for filling the house with us.</p><p>Let’s keep that kick off energy going ‘til College Football 26 drops this summer 😉 <a href="https://t.co/6lbfS1zAsd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6lbfS1zAsd</a></p></div>— EASPORTSCollege (@EASPORTSCollege) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSCollege/status/1879951843591438446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It arrived as the first franchise entry in 11 years and was immediately successful, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-is-off-to-a-strong-start-ahead-of-its-official-release">pulling in as many as 700,000 players in its first day of early access</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/22-million-people-were-willing-to-pay-100-to-play-college-football-25-3-days-early">a staggering 2.2 million by the end</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It later closed 2024 as the best selling sports video game in U.S. history in terms of dollar sales, putting it above even the professional league Madden NFL franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-review">In our 7/10 review</a>, IGN said: "College Football 25 nails the on-field action with a dynamic feel, stellar graphics, and tons of smart gameplay tweaks. However, so much of what's off the field feels unfinished, with UI issues and barebones modes that seem like they are waiting for a rebuild next season."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

I am grateful to the development team for their cooperation in optimizing the game until the very last moment. I hope many people will experience Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Steam Deck.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth doesn’t have its own PlayStation 4 port, it’s surprising to see it gain the coveted Steam Deck Verified badge, a feat that mainline <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-review"><u>Final Fantasy 16</u></a> couldn’t manage to achieve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, to celebrate, Square-Enix created three “specially crafted” Steam Deck units; but these are no simple custom case or repaint job, they're full-on Chocobo makeovers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Flocked with the Chocobo’s iconic yellow fluffy fur, feathers, and beak, one of these custom Steam Deck units was shown off in an official video, below. However, Square Enix warned: "we don’t advise trying to wrap high-tech gaming gear in fur at home."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Three of the furry Steam Decks were created, and on further inspection, they appear to be built on a Steam Deck OLED model (you can tell from the color of each analog stick). But you can’t help but question how practical it would be to game on the Chocobo Steam Deck, given that all of the feathers and flocking might get in the way. However, Square Enix has left the fan intake open at the rear, so the system can breathe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If your mouth waters at the prospect of playing a 100-hour RPG on a furry Steam Deck, Square-Enix has teased on social media that it will run some kind of giveaway or competition so a few lucky fans can get their hands on one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth's Steam Deck verification reinforced the idea the game will eventually make its way to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name">the just-announced Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Indeed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-games-reportedly-set-for-release-on-nintendo-switch-2">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is reportedly set for Nintendo Switch in 2026</a>, after Final Fantasy 7 Remake hits the console this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth launches on PC on January 23.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sayem is a freelancer based in the UK, covering tech &amp; hardware.
