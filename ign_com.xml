A new set drops, you wait maybe 30 minutes too long to buy it, and suddenly every scalper on eBay is selling it for double MSRP with no remorse. But this week? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things are different. Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart have restocked some of the most in-demand Pokémon TCG sets at retail price. No fighting over the last box at Costco, no sketchy third-party Amazon sellers charging a premium, just pure, untainted Pokémon goodness straight from the source.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Best Pokémon Day Deals 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the big catches here is <a href="https://zdcs.link/aM6nyL?object_uuid=15746ef9-2245-4476-8f91-9b32c4188e09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pokémon TCG 151 Booster Bundle</a>, which comes with six booster packs from the Scarlet and Violet 151 set. I'm dying to fill my binder with some of the best cards from 151, like the gorgeous Special Illustration Rare Charizard or Venusaur ex, an absolute tank and playable. It's been one of the hardest sets to find sealed at MSRP, and I don't expect it to stay in stock long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another solid investment right now is Shrouded Fable. <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEjB6M?object_uuid=15746ef9-2245-4476-8f91-9b32c4188e09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Elite Trainer Box</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aX2wnZ?object_uuid=15746ef9-2245-4476-8f91-9b32c4188e09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Booster bundle</a> are in stock at the time of writing and are both set to climb in value before the year is out. It's overlooked by the community right now, but with it being a mini set much like 151, it's a good idea to snap Shrouded Fable packs and boxes up now whilst it's still available.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon: TCG Scarlet and Violet - 151 Booster Bundle</h2><div catalogid="7b596ecb-7318-4bac-ba7d-920162ac376a" id="215877"><div id="215877" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon: TCG Scarlet and Violet - 151 Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This set includes six booster packs from the Scarlet and Violet 151 expansion.
