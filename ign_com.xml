            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-and-assassins-creed-shadows-sale</link>
            <guid>1380178</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Guns and blades.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditionally, the great holiday shopping deals would end after Cyber Monday. That is apparently no longer true. Case in point: today only, Best Buy is offering the console versions of Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 for under $40 each. Specifically, <strong>you can get the PS5 or Xbox</strong> version of <strong>AC Shadows </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/QPVL6j?object_uuid=5cde1036-b3aa-4021-86f6-ad86ad038773&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>for $34.99</strong></a>, and <strong>Black Ops 7 </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/zEJLpo?object_uuid=5cde1036-b3aa-4021-86f6-ad86ad038773&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>for $39.99</strong></a>. Both deals go away at midnight, so grab them fast if you want them.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Today's Best Game Deals</h2><div id="233605" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="c826a57c-825a-4266-a8c1-bfbe6ffbfce2"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 SteelBook Cross-Gen Bundle Edition</h3></p></div><div catalogid="c826a57c-825a-4266-a8c1-bfbe6ffbfce2" id="233606"><div id="233606" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Black Ops 7 deal is particularly good, because it’s on the steelbook cross-gen bundle editions of the game. That means you get a free steelbook case for the game with your purchase. And regardless of whether you buy the PS4 or PS5 version, it’ll work on both systems natively. The same is true of the Xbox version, with the Xbox One and Xbox Series X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike most similar sales we’ve seen recently, no other retailer is matching the prices, meaning they’re exclusive to Best Buy. These are by far the best deals we’ve seen so far on both of these 2025 games. In other words, I wouldn’t expect to see either game drop to a lower price this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real question, of course, is whether the games are any good. If we’re talking about Assassin’s Cree Shadows, the answer is yes, absolutely. In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-review">8/10 review</a>, critic Jarrett Green wrote, “Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes a flashing blade to the series’ established norms, trimming them to a more precise form in lieu of chopping them down outright. Combat is aggressive and requires more intentional parrying and skill management than in the past, and exploring the gorgeous provinces of Sengoku-period Japan is encouraged thanks to the revamped map that deemphasizes collecting icons and checking off lists.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, the answer is a little more complicated. While the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">campaign</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-zombies-review">Zombies</a> modes are a little lackluster, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review">multiplayer</a> remains strong. In our review of the latter mode, critic Seth Macy wrote, “Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s multiplayer is a great time. The first crop of maps are excellent, taking into consideration the new wall run and wall jump mechanics and how that extra dimension of movement adds so much to the fun. The weapons are all solid with the exception of the SMGs, and even though none have really captured my imagination, they're fun to use and fun to grind.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both of these deals are absolutely killer for games this new, as emphasized by the fact that even Amazon isn’t price matching them. But the sale ends at midnight, so pick up whichever one you want (or both) before the deep discount goes away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN. He also runs IGN's board game and LEGO coverage.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios have issued a lengthy statement after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">the <u>Battlefield 6</u></a> Winter Offensive 1.1.3.0 update saw players reporting widespread issues related to the main menu UI, gameplay stuttering, Breakthrough, and much, much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The message, posted both to Battlefield <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1999147496069628313?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>social media accounts</u></a> and the FPS franchise’s <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-winter-offensive-launch-and-player-feedback" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>website</u></a>, functions both as an explanation and a game plan. BF Studios says hotfixes and updates will now roll out in the coming days as it attempts to iron out the numerous kinks that started making waves in the Battlefield 6 community earlier this week.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Surprise Attack</h2><blockquote data-theme="light">— CAMIKAZE78 (@CAMIKAZE78) <a href="https://twitter.com/CAMIKAZE78/status/1998371829963280511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Winter Offensive was originally positioned to bring wintery new content hand-in-hand with audio fixes, more reliable hit registration, and balance tweaks as BF Studios continues to flesh out the new Battlefield game’s first season. However, as update 1.1.3.0 made its way to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S Tuesday, players were instead met with an army of technical hurdles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clunky main menu navigation and trouble registering hits on firing range targets were two of the more annoying issues being shared around online. One problem that actually impacted moment-to-moment multiplayer gameplay for many, though, involved micro stuttering that saw players freezing in place as they ran into battle. Another, more bizarre result of the new update had to do with what <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1pikb79/stealth_movement_nerf_with_todays_patch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many believed was a stealth nerf to movement</a>, which, despite being applauded by some, has since been reverted and labeled as “<a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1998788825456226525?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>unexpected behavior</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It kind of feels like there's an absolute deadline schedule by which point stuff comes out no matter what," one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1piepe5/comment/nt5mx3f/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user commented</a> shortly after the update went live. "I know DICE always had this 'fix X, break Y' modus operandi that's amusingly consistent amongst generations of people who worked there but so far every update has been literally that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The occasional hiccup aside, BF Studios has been steadily moving through Battlefield 6 Season 1, but it feels like that momentum has come to a halt with Winter Offensive. Even if the stop is only temporary, the update’s launch marks a moment of uncertainty for fans as they await Season 2 and as the holidays rush in. Winter Offensive has proven to be so problematic, in fact, that Battlefield REDSEC, the Battlefield 6 battle royale offshoot experience, had its Elite Series <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1998882936569905156?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">postponed</a> due to “unforeseen technical issues.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to be upfront: this is on us,” the Battlefield team said yesterday.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 is absolutely unplayable after the patch<br>Well done <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@battlefield</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/EA_DICE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@EA_DICE</a> <a href="https://t.co/U5rF4gaDWt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/U5rF4gaDWt</a></p>— DANNYonPC (@DANNYonPC) <a href="https://twitter.com/DANNYonPC/status/1998441358604865699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <h2 data-cy="title2">Calling for Backup</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios wants Battlefield 6 players to rest easy knowing that, if these issues haven’t already been fixed, they will be fixed soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to give you a clear status update on the issues we are tracking, the work already completed, and our near-term and future plans,” today’s statement says. “The team has been reviewing all reports since the update, including items related to Breakthrough, the Firing Range, Portal, the Main Menu, and performance topics such as micro-stuttering on PC, along with several other issues raised by the community.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Technical difficulties related to incorrect ticket sizes for Conquest, daily challenge rewards, infantry momentum, and battle pass tier skipping have already been resolved. More thorough hotfixes are now scheduled to begin tomorrow, December 12, starting with fixes for micro stuttering, main menu navigation, and the firing range for PC via Steam players. PS5 and Xbox players will benefit from their own update come December 15, which should bring an end to issues for the main menu and firing range.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stat tracking, especially pertaining to bot kills, is another issue that’s persisted through recent weeks that BF Studios plans to address soon, with rubber banding related to minimum spec PCs also set to be addressed. Perhaps the most heavily criticized aspects of Winter Offensive, though, were the changes to Breakthrough and vehicle placements announced via the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-1130-patch-notes-detail-audio-improvements-and-map-changes-coming-with-season-1-winter-offensive"><u>update 1.1.3.0 patch notes</u></a> last week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios says it’s heard the complaints related to how the update may have made victory too easy for the attacking team, specifically calling attention to concerns about objective placement, vehicle spawns, and attacker momentum. The developers explain that some fixes in this regard, specifically pertaining to vehicle spawning, have already been published, but stops short of walking players through how or when it plans to address these concerns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Your feedback continues to guide the direction of our Breakthrough improvements, and we will share more as future adjustments take shape,” the message adds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More tweaks to vehicles should help the overall Battlefield 6 experience, too, with BF Studios saying it’s implemented updated vehicle damage zones, fixed hit registration for vehicle-mounted machine guns, and adjusted some maps for better pacing during matches. Finally, those who enjoy flying jets should know that air-to-air combat is set to receive some adjustments, including reduced jet canon damage, early next year, with a dedicated air radar planned to launch after Season 1.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We will continue validating the resolutions already in development, gathering additional data from your reports, and prioritizing remaining issues based on severity and player impact,” BF Studios adds. “Several items have already been resolved, or will be through our upcoming hotfixes. More improvements are planned in upcoming updates.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched October 10 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X | S. It’s been on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-leave-wicked-grin-skin-almost-unrecognizable-after-community-calls-out-bright-colors">a bit of a rollercoaster</a> ever since, as players have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-just-had-the-best-month-of-sales-in-the-us-of-any-game-in-the-last-three-years">logged on</a> to both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-won-battlefield-6-fans-rejoice-as-ea-tones-down-bright-colors-on-monster-energy-skin">praise</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rascals-battlefield-6-players-torn-as-323-pack-puts-a-high-price-on-grounded-skins">criticize</a> everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-map-debate-reaches-new-level-as-players-meticulously-measure-70-maps-from-bf3-bf2042-and-more">map sizes</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-quickly-fixes-defibrillators-after-support-players-report-strict-revive-requirements">balance changes</a>.
