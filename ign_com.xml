            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has asked a judge to grant the fired GTA 6 developers interim relief at a preliminary employment tribunal hearing held in the UK this week. Rockstar Games, which also attended the hearing, has issued a response to the claims, denying a number of points made by the union.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has insisted the employees it fired late last year were dismissed because they leaked game features for upcoming and unannounced titles in Discord, not because they were trying to unionize. 34 members of staff at Rockstar were dismissed, 31 in the UK and three in Canada, sparking protests outside the office of GTA 6 developer Rockstar North in Edinburgh, Scotland, and outside parent company Take-Two’s office in London.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Rockstar North and Take-Two Office Protest Photos Nov 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The IWGB, which is representing the affected staff in the UK, has refuted Rockstar’s claim, saying that the workers "only communicated in private and legally-protected trade union channels."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Monday, January 5, a preliminary hearing at the Glasgow Tribunals Centre in Scotland saw the IWGB represent the fired Rockstar workers and make a case for why they should be granted interim relief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interim relief is a legal mechanism that can provide workers with support while they wait for a full hearing. This week’s tribunal will decide whether or not the workers will receive the interim relief while awaiting a date for a full trial. If the interim relief is granted, the workers will be put back on Rockstar’s payroll and have their work visas reinstated where necessary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The IWGB told IGN today that it is hopeful the judge will see it their way, but insisted that if the interim relief is not granted, that doesn’t mean Rockstar will not be found guilty of breaking the law if and when the case goes to trial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We hope this week’s tribunal will grant urgently needed relief to the workers whose lives were turned upside down by Rockstar’s brutal union-busting, leaving them and their families without incomes, without secure futures, and in some cases without even the right to remain in the country they have made their home,” the IWGB said in a statement issued to IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“However, no matter the outcome of this interim hearing, we remain confident in the strength of  the case we have brought against Rockstar Games. We reiterate our firm belief that Rockstar broke the law when it summarily dismissed 31 of our members, and we look forward now to the day we face them in court for a full and substantive tribunal hearing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rockstar hoped to quickly and quietly wipe out a group of workers who were organising for better conditions. Instead, their dismissal of 31 union members captured the world’s attention and ignited an unprecedented uprising of global solidarity. This case is not just about the suffering of the 31 people who lost their livelihoods in the blink of an eye. This is about the arrogance of a company like Rockstar thinking that its size and profitability grant it an unlimited licence to abuse its workers, and to do so with impunity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Whether or not interim relief is granted this week, we will continue fighting in the courts and on the streets until we see justice, for the fired Rockstar workers and for workers everywhere fighting for a fairer future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Rockstar Games spokesperson issued IGN with the following statement on this week’s hearing. In it, the company addressed many of the union’s claims, and claimed the organization lacks any evidence to justify emergency interim relief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rockstar categorically denies the claim being heard in today’s hearing,” the Rockstar spokesperson said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have consistently made clear that we took necessary action against a group of individuals across the UK and Canada who discussed highly confidential information, including relating to game features from upcoming and unannounced titles, in an insecure and public social channel. This was a breach of long-standing and well-understood confidentiality policies. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This channel contained at least 25 non-Rockstar employees, including employees of competitor game developers, a video games industry journalist, as well as dozens of anonymous, unidentifiable members. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Meanwhile, employees who posted union-supportive messages, but who did not breach confidentiality policies, were not dismissed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We regret that these dismissals were necessary; however, confidentiality is fundamental to everything Rockstar Games does. Global interest in our games is unparalleled. Even the smallest leak of any information relating to our products and practices can cause major commercial and creative damage — as we have seen in the past — and damage the experience of our loyal players and dedicated team. This was never about union membership. We have always taken a zero-tolerance approach to unauthorized releases of information — and we always will.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has indicated to IGN that it believes the IWGB’s claim of “union-busting” is baseless, and that the union has no evidence to support its statements. Rockstar has also denied having a “blacklist” of union members, stressing that at the time of the dismissals, the company did not know whether the claimants were union members, so could not have targeted them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize">as it has said before</a>, Rockstar employees themselves raised concerns to the company and granted representatives access to the “social” channel, not the Discord channel used for official union organizing. It maintains that this social Discord channel was not private or for employees only, and indeed contained hundreds of users, including employees of competitor game developers, a video games industry journalist, and dozens of anonymous, unidentifiable members. As IGN has also reported, Rockstar has claimed that the union channel mods didn’t know who was in the channel, and that it posed a leak risk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What about this alleged leaked information? Rockstar believes it to be significant and related to game features around GTA 6. This includes specific game features, comments on the progress of GTA 6 development, and timelines to launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar believes that if the comments in question were leaked they would have been big gaming news and might even have affected Take-Two’s share price. When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">Rockstar officially announced that GTA 6 would be delayed by six months</a> to November 19, 2026, the market value of Take-Two plummeted $3.75 billion in a single day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And Rockstar has pointed to its well-established zero tolerance approach to leaks, highlighting that it dismissed a Rockstar employee in Lincoln, UK in April 2025, who it alleged disclosed confidential information about GTA 6 to a third party who published the information to social media, and dismissed an employee in the U.S. in November 2023 and another in India in November 2025 for two separate acts of information leaking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hearing comes after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-prime-minister-sir-keir-starmer-says-rockstar-firing-31-gta-6-developers-over-alleged-union-busting-is-deeply-concerning-and-pledges-that-ministers-will-now-investigate"><u>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the case “deeply concerning,"</u></a> and pledged that ministers would investigate. The layoffs were raised by Rockstar North's local MP Chris Murray in the UK's Parliament during a session of Prime Minister's Questions that took place late last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The video games company Rockstar in my constituency last month fired 31 employees without providing evidence or union representation," Murray told the Prime Minister. "The [Independent Workers Union of Great Britain] IWGB alleges union busting. Having met Rockstar they failed to reassure me they are following employment law and I share concerns about union busting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Given this government is responsible for the biggest increase in workers rights in a generation," Murray continued, "does the Prime Minister agree all companies regardless of profit size must follow UK employment law and all workers have the right to join a union?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a deeply concerning case," Starmer replied. "Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Our ministers will look into the particular case that he [Murray] raises and will keep him updated."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Union busting has consequences!

I was not assured their process paid robust attention to UK employment law, I was not convinced that this course of action was necessary, and alarmingly, I did not leave informed on exactly what these 31 people had done to warrant their immediate dismissal."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN recently questioned Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick on the matter, who answered by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-our-culture-is-extraordinary-amid-accusations-of-union-busting-at-gta-6-dev-rockstar-games"><u>defending the company's culture</u></a> and saying that Take-Two was "incredibly proud of our labor relations."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Lesley Martin/PA Images via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

And we're kicking off a month of very orky IGN First coverage with their opening cinematic (watch it above), setting the stage for a load of krumpin'. You gotta respect the boyz for knowing what they're about and living their truth, even if their truth is largely mayhem and murder. They never pretend to be anything they're not, you know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The action starts with an Ork assault on one of the last battle barges of the Blood Ravens chapter of Space Marines. The long-time protagonists of the Dawn of War series, the red-clad Astartes are in a bad spot at this point in the 42nd Millennium, with the chapter barely clinging to life. And their return to Kronus hasn't gone unnoticed, with their perennial rival in the warboss Gorgutz meeting them head-on. It's the biggest and meanest we've ever seen him, trivially snapping a Primaris marine in half with his Mega Armor exoskeleton.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As the surviving Blood Ravens try to escape their doomed ship – led by returning heroes Commander Cyrus and Chief Librarian Jonah Orion – Gorgutz orders his Ork Rok (basically just a big asteroid full of orks with rockets built in) to crash on the planet and pursue the beakies. But the Ork campaign won't just be about his story, as there's a native warboss on Kronus already who isn't eager to bend the knee to this Nob from the sky.You'll get to learn a lot more about him, and the Ork campaign and battle mechanics, all month long as part of IGN First. So keep an eye out for our interviews with the creative director for Dawn of War 4, a demonstration of the new synced melee animation system, and a hands-on preview of the first several campaign missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, don't miss our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4-first-impressions-from-a-series-veteran">first preview</a> of the upcoming RTS sequel, and stay tuned for our exclusive new coverage all January long!

But this was something Clair Obscur's team hadn't expected, Nohra explained, as they weren't sure if players would enjoy the game to the extent that they did.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The only thing I regret is not making it clearer that if you want the intended difficulty for the boss, you have to go beat it now," Nohra said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content. And that's something I underestimated, which made people that wanted a challenging end boss fight feel a bit disappointed. I don't regret doing it the way we did it, but [we could have] had more explanation about your choice [in Act 3]."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By way of an explanation, lead programmer Tom Guillermin said it had been "a surprise for us [that] people were doing every single thing there is to do in the game before going to the final dungeon," having previously been unsure how long players would stick around in the game's world once the ability to go beat the final boss became available. "We're happy about that," Guillermin added, "but we didn't see it coming."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For players seeking even tougher challenges, the game's final DLC added a fresh area full of the hardest fights in the game — and players have been having fun with their own creative ways to make these even harder. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fan-wins-ridiculous-8-hour-boss-battle-with-10545-successful-parries-and-no-dodges">one intrepid expeditioner spent eight hours notching up 10,000 parries against one of the DLC's toughest new bosses</a> in frankly ridiculous conditions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's huge popularity and success, its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-storms-the-game-awards-2025-wins-coveted-game-of-the-year">recent sweep at The Game Awards 2025 speaks for itself</a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/cairn-preview-face-beauty-and-danger-atop-the-worlds-most-dangerous-mountain</link>
            <guid>1399603</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked why he wanted to climb Mt. Everest, famed British mountaineer George Mallory famously offered the simple reply, "Because it’s there.” After several hours playing through an exclusive, hands-on demo of Cairn, the upcoming climbing-survival sim from The Game Bakers, I’m beginning to understand what ol’ George was on about. My time on the mountain was filled with arduous climbs punctuated with periods of quiet reflection, life-or-death battles against the elements, and a combined sense of victory and wonder as I reached higher and higher. Tape those fingers, chalk your hands, and get ready to dig in; this climb will be a test of wits and endurance. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Get a Grip</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I stand at the base of a stone wall as small cracks and ledges pockmark the surface. I tentatively reach up a hand to grab a chest-high hold, and begin to slowly hoist myself up the face of the cliff. I’m working slowly and cautiously through the day and into the night, fearful to make a wrong move and plunge to my death. There are a few tense moments as my arms begin to shake, a telltale-sign that they are ready to give out, but, with a carefully placed belay for safety, I make it to the top. There, under a canopy of stars, I see Mt. Kami in the distance, a towering and ferocious summit as yet untamed by mountaineers, and our goal on this climb. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cairn Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The deliberate, highly-manual control of climbing reminds me a bit of Manual Samuel, or even QWOP, where the challenge lies in your ability to precisely control each limb. However, while games like that ratchet up the struggle as you fight with your intentionally obtuse and flailing character, in Cairn, Aava is your partner, and a highly skilled one. While the majority of control is in the player's hand, she makes the connection to the cliff itself, and seems to be smart about her grips.  Place one of her hands on an outcropping and she will grab on, slide a leg towards a narrow crack and she will wedge her foot in as best she can. It feels like a 90-10 sharing of responsibility, and as I ascended up the face of Mount Kami, I couldn’t help but feel a level of trust with Aava that grew with each leg of the climb. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Maybe you can buy time by shaking out an exhausted hand or leg, but you will ultimately need to get to a firm and sustainable position, or risk losing hold entirely, and joining the untold number of climbers that never made it back from their attempt to scale Mount Kami.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s an ebb and flow to the climbing. Sometimes, clear hand and footholds make for a fast and controlled ascent. Often, though, the path isn’t so clear or friendly, and I have to make due with wedging a foot against a flat surface, or gripping around the outside corner of a rock, taking advantage of Aava’s crushing grip strength when there’s no edge to take hold of. These work temporarily, but exertion quickly expends energy. Small shakes in limbs giving way to tremors and audible sounds of distress indicate these grips are about to break. Maybe you can buy time by shaking out an exhausted hand or leg, but you will ultimately need to get to a firm and sustainable position, or risk losing hold entirely, and joining the untold number of climbers that never made it back from their attempt to scale Mount Kami. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A core promise of Cairn is that you can essentially climb anywhere, that all of the rock face is your playground. However, you don’t just stick to surfaces like a tree frog the way Link does in Breath of the Wild; picking your route is essential to ensure you have the cracks and other holds necessary to make headway. Calling the climbing a puzzle would be reductive, it’s more like a toybox filled with puzzles for you to choose from. There’s no yellow paint to mark the path, but you can pull the camera out for a wide view to help with the decision making (and enjoy the gorgeous vista while you are at it.) Sometimes it’s a straightforward choice, like a slower, but easier route, or a faster, but more challenging course. But often it’s more complex than that, with options that mix tough segments in different orders, or appear easy overall save for a section that doesn't have a clear path, and you’ll just need to figure it out when you get there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, Aava has more than just her physical prowess to assist with her climb. Climbot is her trusty robot companion, following close behind and carrying an end of Aava’s climbing rope. By driving a piton into the rock, she can build a belay, loop the rope through the piton to the bot, catching her if she falls, and allowing her to lean off the cliff to rest, or rappel down. There’s a limited supply, but once you reach a flat section, Climbot can collect the piton to use again. These are really handy for saving progress on long climbs, and can be literal life savers, especially if used before heading into particularly tricky sections. They do take a bit of time to set properly, though, which I learned the hard way when I realized too late that I was going to lose my grip and hadn’t secured myself to the mountain. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Live to Climb Another Day</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve reached the top of a few cliff faces now, and am growing more confident. I’m climbing faster, and reading the surface of the mountain more clearly, making better choices about which routes to take. As I near the top of another climb, I spot some scribbles on the wall, a drawing and  message from a young climber who came this way. I pull myself up and prepare to make camp when another Climbot, similar to mine but badly damaged, drags itself into view before breaking down entirely. Its solo descent from some untold altitude, with no sign of its owner, tells the grim story of what likely transpired. A short while later, I come around a bend near a waterfall, and find the remains of a climber. Aava kneels down over her fallen comrade, telling them gently, “Sometimes you come for the mountain. Sometimes the mountain comes for you.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mt. Kami is a dangerous place, particularly for a solo climber. As you climb you face the ever-present threat of a deadly fall, but that’s not all the mountain has to throw at you. Cold weather can sap your strength and health, rain can erode your grip, while storms and nightfall rob you of visibility. You’ll also need to stay fed and hydrated to survive, and tend to physical wear and tear of Aava’s hands. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, this mountain isn’t all sheer walls and rocky outcroppings. Long climbs are punctuated with terraces, flat areas part way up the mountain, and caves offering a respite from the ascent. Here, temporary campsites called Bivouacs offer a place to save and pitch your tent. Nestled in her shelter, Aava is protected from the elements, and can cook meals on her stove, sort through her pack, and catch up on some much-needed rest to restore her health. This is also a good time to prepare for what’s next by taping up bloody fingers and preparing warm food and drink to better endure dropping temperatures. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a long climb, and will take more resources than can fit in a single backpack. While you can occasionally grab edible plants mid-climb, it’s these terraces and caves where scavenging opportunities really present themselves. Streams, waterfalls, and ponds can refill your canteen, while local flora and fauna, like dandelions and fish, afford a chance to gather things to cook or eat. Bear-proof boxes or abandoned supplies might be right in front of you, other times you need to stray off the beaten path and explore.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Call of the Mountain</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m now four days into this ascent, and I feel like I must be thousands of feet above where I started. I’m climbing extremely well now, finding narrow footholds and recognizing more ways to maintain my grip, but there’s something going on with Aava. I can’t quite put my finger on what, but there’s more to it than just trying to be the first to tame Mount Kami. Her agent has called a few times via Climbot, but she’s ignored him enough times that it seems less funny, more intentional. She was cheery enough following a message from friends with some well wishes, but when the smile faded, she looked more pained than pleased. I keep thinking back to a moment after Climbot plays back a message from Aava’s partner, some innocent updates about the going-ons back home. The way she turns to her mechanical companion, no offer of thanks or a smile, instead rebuking it with, “Happy now robot? You’ve ruined everything.” Something isn’t right, and I don’t know what.<strong> </strong></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We might see some other climbers on our ascent...</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While Cairn seems to be about the journey and struggle of the climb, don’t take that to mean that story takes a back seat. The Game Bakers have been<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/cairn-official-developer-overview-trailer-women-led-games-x-sgf-2025"><u> clear that we might see some other climbers on our ascent</u></a>, and, while what I’ve seen has mostly been the focused solitude of one person’s fight against gravity, the bits of dialogue from Aava and audio playback from Climbot have contributed enough pieces to the narrative mosaic in my three hours or so that I’m starting to get a better sense of who Aava is, and that whatever is driving this death-defying climb is something she’s willing to risk her life for. But I don’t know why, and every time I pull myself farther up the mountain it’s with the hope that it’s pulling me a bit closer to finding out. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The same can be said for Mount Kami itself. These often sheer, jagged cliffs give off an unmistakable hostility, but the waterways and greenery give it an undeniable serenity at times too. There’s a complex identity and history to this mountain, one that’s uncovering the further I climb. At one point in my demo I came across cave-dwellings that had been carefully sculpted into multiple homes and common areas, with a few abandoned writings that helped understand the people who lived there, and a bit of their relationships with the adventurers who came through. Later, a covered shelf acting as a platform for some abandoned tents, with journals wondering about the presence of bears, gives me a sense of dread about why they are abandoned and what might be waiting ahead. A broken cable car and toppled-over vending machine (with some convenient snacks) help fill in the story told of a place that was once more accessible and open to the world, but has since become more closed off. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As my time with the Cairn demo comes to an end I find myself thinking more about Mount Kami, about how I could approach every area I climbed differently the next time, and what awaits farther up. I’m invested in the story, but just as intrigued in the idea of talking to friends about their routes and watching others take on the mountain, especially those brave enough to challenge the piton-less, permadeath Free-Solo difficulty. Fortunately, I won’t need to wait much longer to test the mountain again, Cairn plants its flag on PS5 and PC on January 29th. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/cairn-preview-face-beauty-and-danger-atop-the-worlds-most-dangerous-mountain]]></content:encoded>
