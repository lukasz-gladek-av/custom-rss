The developers will have a long list of cuts and changes — some incidental, some significant — under their belts. Perhaps the decision to cut Ava was in response to a realization that fans might not have responded well to her inclusion. Or perhaps there was another reason — or multiple reasons — for making the change.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that outspoken Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1840461497371402481" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked his Twitter followers</a> what they thought of Ava in September 2024, just a year before Borderlands 4 came out. Most of the responses were negative, with some even pleading with Pitchford not to include her in Borderlands 4. Did this social media response have something to do with the decision?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Gearbox continues to update Borderlands 4 with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-patch-makes-big-balance-changes-with-all-vault-hunters-getting-buffs">performance improvements and balance changes</a>.

Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Activision hasn’t come out and said this trial is a direct attack on EA’s Battlefield 6 launch, fans are under no illusion about the optics here. It’s worth noting that Black Ops 6 is already playable via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, but the trial will benefit Essential and Premium users on Xbox and of course players on PlayStation and Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the latest salvo in what has become a popcorn-worthy back-and-forth between Activision and EA, with each mega publisher’s big budget FPS vying for the hearts and minds of the gaming community this holiday season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In August, Activision shocked the Call of Duty community when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-battlefield-6s-commitment-to-gritty-realism-activision-makes-shock-call-of-duty-change-for-black-ops-7-we-hear-the-feedback"><u>it confirmed that Operators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from Black Ops 6 would no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7</u></a>. This came as a big surprise to players who had expected content they’d bought for Black Ops 6 to carry forward, as it has done with previous entries. Explaining the decision, Activision said Black Ops 7 “needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The feeling was that Activision felt the heat from Battlefield 6, which is going for a more grounded aesthetic. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-call-of-dutys-obsession-with-goofy-skins-firmly-entrenched-battlefield-6-dev-commits-to-gritty-realism-i-dont-think-it-needs-nicki-minaj"><u>Developer DICE has indicated it has no plans to release crossover skins that would break the aesthetic Battlefield 6 is going for</u></a>, and promised the developers were listening to fan feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DBLTAP</u></a>, Battlefield 6 design director Shashank Uchil doubled down on EA's commitment to grounded realism, and even pointed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-call-of-duty-season-5-snoop-dogg"><u>Call of Duty's infamous Nicki Minaj skin</u></a> as something Battlefield 6 doesn't need.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It has to be grounded," he said. "That is what BF3 and BF4 was — it was all soldiers, on the ground. It’s going to be like this,” Uchil said, pointing at the key art featuring soldiers in soldier gear looking out over a wartorn New York City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: “I don’t think it needs Nicki Minaj. Let’s keep it real, keep it grounded.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, last month, EA ramped up its Battlefield 6 marketing, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-love-how-we-all-know-exactly-what-this-was-a-middle-finger-to-battlefield-6-live-action-trailer-takes-aim-at-call-of-duty">taking a direct jab at Call of Duty with a new live-action trailer</a>. More recently, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-extended-by-24-hours-ends-just-a-day-before-the-battlefield-6-release-date">Activision extended the Black Ops 7 open beta</a> to run an additional 24 hours to October 9, taking it right up to Battlefield 6's release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both games are crucial releases for their publishers. Battlefield 6 leads the charge, releasing October 10 before Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 counter-attacks on November 14. It will be interesting to see which of the two mega publishers is happiest when the dust settles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The long wait for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> is nearly over, but that isn’t stopping fans from arguing about whether multiplayer is better with Open or Closed Weapon classes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and the four-company team at Battlefield Studios will let loose their new entry in the large-scale military shooter series this Friday, October 10, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-global-release-times-confirmed">find out when, exactly, here</a>). Along with a new campaign, guns, gadgets, and maps, the developers behind Battlefield 6 have told fans to look forward to a return to form following the disappointment that was Battlefield 2042.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beta and Battlefield Labs players have largely come away excited for what Battlefield 6 promises, but the debate surrounding Open and Closed Weapons is the main thing on fans’ minds just two days out from launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The conversation picked up when players went hands-on during the August Battlefield 6 beta tests. While many past Battlefield games feature Closed Weapons – a design decision that locks classes to a specific set of guns – many were surprised to see the new Battlefield game add and prioritize an option for Open Weapons, which largely removes gun restrictions between classes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Open style is similar to the system used in Battlefield 2042, but it’s not the bad taste in players’ mouths that has them bickering. Closed Weapons defenders argue these restrictions encourage players to not only think on their feet but also rely on teamwork, a key element for many longtime fans of the series. The system could also pour cold water on meta gameplay strategies that could result in an unbalanced number of players relying on one particularly powerful gun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those on the other side of the fence feel Open Weapons offer players of all skill levels more freedom to craft a loadout that fits their playstyles while rewarding those who choose specific loadouts. Though perhaps not quite as vocal, there are plenty of players who feel Open loadouts are the way to go – and BF Studios agrees.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield Studios Says Players Prefer Open Weapons</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Debate continued up to earlier this week, when BF Studios offered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-day-one-patch-includes-changes-to-movement-weapon-recoil-rush-and-more"><u>a pre-release breakdown for its Battlefield 6 launch day plans</u></a>, previewing the contents of its day one patch for those looking forward to in-game changes following post-beta feedback. It came hand-in-hand with confirmation that data pointed to “a vast majority of players” preferring the Open system more than the Closed system after trying both options between different playlists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This reinforces our belief that Open Weapons is the right path forward for Battlefield 6,” the message from BF Studios says. “At the same time, we recognize that some players prefer the Closed Weapons experience. To support them, official Closed Weapons playlists will be available at launch.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter how loud fans of the Closed method are, BF Studios is adamant that players mostly gravitate toward an Open system, even if Battlefield 6 will continue to support both options. Meanwhile, many have used this latest update only as fuel to continue their mission to see this week’s new Battlefield game shift its focus to the Closed system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Their argument revolves around the notion that open beta players only favored Open Weapons because relevant playlist options are the first to appear on the Battlefield 6 multiplayer menu screen. So, the idea is, if your average player, who is unfamiliar with the discourse, boots up the game, they’ll need to dig for a Closed option, resulting in skewed data.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a criticism many are leaning on that EA and BF Studios have already stepped in to stomp out. Lead Battlefield producer at DICE David Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1975264910285459695" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>took to X/Twitter</u></a> to explain how the team came to their conclusion. He addresses the argument that Closed playlist options were hidden from players, reminding displeased fans that playlist and mode tiles often moved around, and their data accounted for that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yes they moved around alot, as you may have noticed,” Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1975266470260273583" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said in response</u></a> to a fan asking for clarification. “We did this to all tiles, [Conquest] vs [Breakthrough] etc. See how much tile placement impact pick rates and how single mode vs playlist with multiple modes differed, etc.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sirland’s explanation still hasn’t quite quelled the uproar, as one third of the Battlefield 6 community demands more answers while another third is voicing their support for Open playlists more than ever. That final third mostly just wants the fighting to come to an end.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Brutal truth:</p><p>Casuals won’t care about Closed Weapons. Or Open Weapons. Or even what weapon they’re using most of the time.</p><p>They just wanna play Battlefield 👍 <a href="https://t.co/3x2CQYxgXl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/3x2CQYxgXl</a></p></div>— Westie (@MrProWestie) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrProWestie/status/1975283650351800824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <h2 data-cy="title2">Preparing for Launch</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As BF Studios and EA barrel toward the launch of Battlefield 6, disgruntled fans continue to take to comment sections across social media to ask the developers to give Closed playlists more time in the spotlight. Complaints and memes poking fun at the situation have flooded Reddit, in particular, with many replies from users calling out debaters as simply being a vocal minority.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would be surprised if the open vs closed weapon debate represents more than 10% of players,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nztemf/comment/ni4jbd3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>popular comment said</u></a>. “I think 10% is being very generous lol,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nztemf/comment/ni4qvr5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Battlefield 6, Open vs Closed <a href="https://t.co/hffyEz2npw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/hffyEz2npw</a></p>— IT'S REAL.

At the time, senior console combat designer Matthew Nickerson said the team didn’t want to “make a decision or really pigeonhole” how players experience Battlefield 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it’s ongoing, and I think it’ll continually evolve, but again, from a design side, we don’t want to make a decision for the player base at the end of the day,” Nickerson added. “We want to support both moving forward, and again, a key mantra for Battlefield 6 is, ‘Play Battlefield how you want to,’ so we’re making sure we support both open and closed systems. We just don’t want to make the decision for the player.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear if EA and BF Studios have any plans to address the Open vs. Closed Weapons debate further ahead of the launch of Battlefield 6. With the recent acknowledgment reaffirming its commitment to the Open system while reassuring players that Closed options will remain available, it seems unlikely BF Studios will change course anytime soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on our time with the Battlefield 6 beta, we’ve got a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/Battlefield_6_Beta_Beginner%27s_Guide_and_Tips">BF6 Beginner’s Guide and Tips</a>, plus the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/Best_BF6_Loadouts">best Battlefield 6 Loadouts</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/BF6_Range_Finder_Explained">how to use the Range Finder</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/How_to_Deploy_Bipod">deploy the Bipod</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/How_to_Turn_Off_Haptic_Feedback">how to turn off Haptic Feedback in Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.
