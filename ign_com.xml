            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is the first game to use its upgraded PSSR upscaler on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company made it official in a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/27/upgraded-pssr-upscaler-is-coming-to-ps5-pro/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, where Mark Cerny, Lead Architect, PS5 and PS5 Pro, said the upgraded version of PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) is rolling out globally to PS5 Pro players in the coming weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PSSR is an AI library that analyzes game images pixel by pixel as it upscales them, and it’s been used to boost the effective resolution of over 50 titles on PS5 Pro to date, Cerny explained.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve been hard at work on a new version of PSSR, which takes a very different approach to not only the neural network but also the overall algorithm,” he added. “We are happy to share that Resident Evil Requiem — shipping today — is the first title to use this more advanced PSSR, which is helping to keep both frame rate and image quality high.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom’s Masaru Ijuin, Senior Manager Engine Development Support Section R&amp;D Foundational Technology Department, commented: “With Resident Evil Requiem, we focused on enhancing the presentation quality of the protagonist through an upgraded version of RE Engine to deepen the player’s immersion in horror. For example, each individual strand of hair and beard is rendered as a polygon, allowing it to move realistically in response to body motion and wind. The way light passes through his hair changes depending on how the strands of hair are overlapped as well. This detailed expression of texture is one of the many details that we would especially love for our fans to see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The upgraded PSSR has allowed us to elevate our expressiveness by successfully processing these details and textural particularities, which are traditionally difficult to upscale because of their intricacy. We hope you will experience this unprecedented level of horror and visual fidelity, and the new gameplay feel it delivers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To illustrate the point, Sony published one screenshot of Resident Evil Requiem featuring original PSSR upscaling alongside the same image featuring the new PSSR upscaling. The strands of hair do look slightly more defined in the second screenshot.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil Requiem Upgraded PSSR Upscaler PS5 Pro Comparison Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cerny said the algorithm and neural network used in the new PSSR stems from Sony’s Project Amethyst partnership with AMD. “Through AMD’s FSR 4 upscaling technology, PC gamers have already seen the benefits of our collaboration,” he said. “With the updated PSSR, we’re delivering the very latest of this co-developed technology with a further six months of refinement for PS5 Pro players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony said multiple existing games will be upgraded to the improved PSSR in March, but there’s no word yet on which games will be included. There will also be a system software update at that time; selecting “Enhance PSSR Image Quality” in Settings on PS5 Pro will allow you to experience the new PSSR with any PS5 Pro games that currently support PSSR.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Once the system update releases next month, try it and see, some games may have noticeably crisper graphics,” Cerny said.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/972bb427abf83263cbd620377e02a6284602da82-1772199338255.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the game has only been available a few hours, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-launches-big-on-steam-breaks-series-record">Requiem is already Steam's biggest ever launch for a Resident Evil title</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The battle of the extraction shooters is on, but developers Bungie and Embark are presenting a united front on social media — even after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> temporarily censored <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> in chat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After the Marathon Server Slam event went live yesterday (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-server-slam-gets-big-player-numbers-on-steam-bungie-acknowledges-ui-and-pvp-frequency-complaints">and hit impressive Steam concurrent player numbers</a>), players noticed that Embark’s hugely successful Arc Raiders was censored in chat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A clip showing Tyler 'Ninja' Blevins of Fortnite fame finding this out for himself went viral on social media after Jake Lucky posted it to Twitter / X, below. Other competitive shooters, such as Halo, Counter-Strike, and Apex Legends, were not censored.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">ARC Raiders is censored in Marathon's chat in game LOL <a href="https://t.co/W2XUiYfJ3S" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/W2XUiYfJ3S</a></p>— Jake Lucky 🔜 GDC (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/2027112371601408438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 26, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">This censorship didn’t last long, and Arc Raiders is now allowed in Marathon chat. But the odd situation did spark a wholesome follow-up as the official Marathon account replied to the viral tweet to declare “Arc Raiders is awesome,” in an in-game chat screenshot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, the official Arc Raiders account has replied to Marathon with a similarly loving statement: “No matter if you're a Runner or a Raider, loot is loot. We’ll save you a seat in the shuttle 🫶”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">No matter if you're a Runner or a Raider, loot is loot.<br>We’ll save you a seat in the shuttle 🫶</p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2027333076351688808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 27, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">So, all smiles on social media for now. But of course there’s huge pressure on Marathon to do well for Bungie, especially after Destiny 2’s downturn and the significant internal struggles at the legendary studio. In November, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-bungie-hasnt-brought-in-as-much-money-as-it-thought-it-would-when-it-bought-the-developer-as-destiny-2-falls-off-a-cliff">Bungie parent company Sony said the studio had failed to meet its sales and user engagement expectations</a>, and recorded a 31.5 billion yen (approx. $204.2 million) impairment charge as a result. That was significant enough to drag down profits at Sony’s Game &amp; Network Services Segment, which includes Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony chief financial officer (CFO) Lin Tao said at the time: “Regarding Destiny 2, partially due to the changes in the competitive environment, the level of sales and user engagement have not reached the expectations we had at the time of the acquisition of Bungie. While we will continue to make improvements, we downwardly revised the business projection for the time being, and recorded an impairment loss against a portion of the assets at Bungie.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A few months before Sony's financial report, in August last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pete-parsons-is-leaving-bungie"><u>Bungie CEO Pete Parsons left the company after 23 years and nearly 10 as CEO</u></a>. He was succeeded by Justin Truman, previously chief development officer and fellow Bungie veteran. Parsons oversaw Bungie during many turbulent years, first taking over as CEO in 2016 from Harold Ryan and overseeing its break from Activision in 2019. He was at the helm throughout many of the events catalogued in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch"><u>2021 report on Bungie's internal work culture</u></a>. Just months after our report, Bungie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-has-completed-its-37-billion-deal-to-acquire-bungie-and-welcome-it-into-the-playstation-family"><u>was acquired by Sony for $3.7 billion</u></a>, ending the studio's flirtation with independence.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As the acquisition settled in, concerns began to arise about the studio's future. Destiny 2 was struggling, and Marathon was still years away. Then the layoffs came. In 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-hit-with-lay-offs-as-destiny-2-the-final-shape-and-marathon-are-reportedly-delayed"><u>Bungie laid off roughly 100 individuals</u></a> and delayed Destiny 2's The Final Shape DLC, with Parsons taking responsibility for the cuts. Developers told IGN at the time that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover"><u>atmosphere at Bungie was "soul-crushing"</u></a> as fears grew of a total Sony takeover of the company. In 2024, this was followed up with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio"><u>even more layoffs</u></a>, impacting 220 people despite The Final Shape's success. 155 people were also integrated from Bungie into Sony at this time. In the wake of those layoffs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bungie-worker-claims-studio-faced-insolvency-without-sony-acquisition-report"><u>former workers claimed Bungie misrepresented its finances and had significantly overextended itself when Sony acquired the studio</u></a>. It was apparently bad enough that at least one source described as a "well-connected former worker" went so far as to claim that Bungie faced dire consequences if the acquisition hadn't happened, saying that the "alternate history is insolvency."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Troubles continued to rock the studio through the rest of 2024 and into 2025, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-delayed-as-bungie-promises-to-reveal-new-release-date-this-fall"><u>Marathon seeing a delay out of its previous September 2025</u></a> release window. Most recently, Sony confirmed Bungie would be integrated into PlayStation Studios so the company could have more control over the developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in June last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026"><u>Sony said it remained committed to live service video games</u></a> despite high-profile failures such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord"><u>Concord</u></a>, and insisted Marathon would be out before April 2026 despite the mixed alpha feedback and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-developer-bungie-launches-thorough-review-after-once-again-being-found-to-have-used-work-from-an-uncredited-artist"><u>damaging accusations of plagiarism against Bungie</u></a>. Since then Bungie has worked to improve not only Marathon, but the sentiment among gamers around it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week"><u>Sony will be keen to avoid another catastrophic launch like Concord, which was pulled offline just two weeks after launch</u></a>, with one estimate suggesting it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"><u>sold just 25,000 copies</u></a>. It has proved a costly failure for Sony, with hundreds of millions of dollars wasted amid the closure of its developer, Firewalk Studios. Bungie now faces concern over its own future, with the pressure on Marathon to deliver. Marathon launches proper across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S next week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <guid>1448434</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>’s long-awaited patch 12.0 launched this week, and with it came the new playable class, the Techmarine (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-techmarine-update-out-now-check-out-patch-120">check out the patch notes here if you want to know what's included</a>). And while fans are having fun getting to grips with this new Astartes, Space Marine 2’s first ever voice pack has sparked a backlash.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The $4.99 Chapter Voice Pack 1 includes 450 re-recorded voicelines and a unique Space Marine Head cosmetic for each of the following Space Marine Chapters: Blood Angels, Space Wolves and Black Templars. It’s only available as a standalone purchase, and is not included in either the Season Pass 1 or Season Pass 2 (much to the annoyance of some fans). But it’s the way these new voice lines are incorporated into the game that has caused a “mostly negative” Steam user review rating for the DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out that equipping a DLC voiceline will revert to the class’ default voice when interacting with objectives, like when searching a Cadian’s body for codes in Inferno. This was unexpected and, in gameplay, a jarring switch. It means the Ultramarine standard voice lines still play for all the dialogue related to interactive elements within missions, so your Space Marine’s voice will flip flop back and forth, which feels awkward and janky.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, some players feel misled by the 450 re-recorded voicelines number on the Steam page. Most believe this number includes re-recorded voicelines across all languages, not just one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have no idea where they got the 450 voicelines from, it mixes with the standard voice lines when doing operations and it sounds dead silent during the mission because there is no banter,” reads one negative review. “So far the only the difference that is noticeable is that emotes are different. The description seems very deceptive, I am very curious to find out where they got 450 number from.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I am insanely DISAPPOINTED!” reads another. “I've tested the Blood angels voice and I was disappointed that his lines were 80-90% what Vespasius [Vespasius is a Jump Pack Assault Intercessor of the Ultramarines Second Company and leader of Combat Squad Talasa] is just saying besides a few lines. FINE, maybe the writers aren't there anymore. But WHY IN THE EMPEROR'S NAME are the Ops voices not changed???? Check for the Inferno missions, on the part where your obtaining codes for the dead guardsmen, THE BLOOD ANGEL VOICE BECOMES LITERALLY VESPASIUS AGAIN WHEN HE DOESN'T GET THE CODE OR WHEN HE OBTAINS THE CODES!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Not to mention there are no voices for the helmet versions yet! I'm wearing a helmet and my Blood Angel voice sounds like he doesn't got one! MAN I'm disappointed!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another disgruntled fan said: “Such a low-effort underwhelming DLC. Each of these voices lock you out of character banters, objective dialogues are spoken by the original character's voice actor through the vox instead the one you spent $5 on. Adding to the laziness, some voice lines are the same as their vanilla counterparts (ex. the Space Wolf sharing almost all of his reload alerts with Decimus) to the point where you're even questioning if you changed voices altogether. Something that Saber doesn't mention is also how after selecting a voice for a character, you can't revert that decision unless you spend 400 accolades to buy it back. Another complaint is how every single one of the faces presented in this DLC is the most unfazed depiction of stoicism in the galaxy, no expressions or lip sync whatsoever, just pure unadulterated void in each of their eyes. On a positive note however, each voice has different lines for every special ability, showcasing yet again how class locking is a moronic idea in PvE games.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - Chapter Voice Pack 1 Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a similar situation on the Space Marine subreddit, which is currently littered with complaints. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1rfkid1/im_just_sad/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One redditor posted a screenshot of a successful refund on the DLC</a>, saying: “The voice pack is just not a worth the money. Not only was it underwhelming but I almost feel like it was just straight up false advertising. No mission dialogue? No banter between brothers or even not finding data on a Guardsmen? They gave us the option to equip the voice pack and keep our helmets on, but there is no helmet filter for the voices either. I’m a Black Templar fan and to my dismay, it seems like a lot of the voice lines are reused ones from Assault.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know they’d have to add voice lines to every new and existing mission, but that’s what you should be paying them to do. Why would they not go all the way and just release the pack at a higher price ? I’m not trying to be hateful, this game introduced me to the 40k universe and got me hooked. I love this game, I have sunk so many hours into it. That being said I’m just sad this didn’t meet the expectations that a lot of the community had.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Waiting to see if Steam will refund mine right now,” said another customer. “I did earlier. I hope Saber is getting slammed with refund fees for this nonsense,” another said. “From day one I've been telling people: it’s 700 lines in seven languages for three characters. So around 30 lines per character,” another said. “Saber did an abysmal job managing expectations. Telling people the amount of lines including all language versions is like measuring your dick and including the length of your spine.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of all this is that what should have been a positive time for Space Marine 2, with all the cool new additions that came with patch 12.0, is instead perhaps the first meaningful community uproar the game has faced since its record-breaking launch in 2024. Space Marine 2 has been a huge success for Focus, developer Saber, and Warhammer owner Games Workshop, and is credited with leading an army of new fans to the hobby. It's so successful that Games Workshop has made Titus, the game's protagonist, the poster boy of the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-iii">Space Marine 3</a> was announced as in development soon after Space Marine 2 came out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So this DLC backlash is a rare misstep for Saber and Focus when it comes to Space Marine 2, but it will no doubt fuel concern some already have that the priority for both now is the development of Space Marine 3. IGN has asked publisher Focus Entertainment for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Plus, Legends Z-A isn't the only game up for grabs at a discount either, as you can also score Scarlet for just $35.99, which is one of the best prices I've ever seen on the Gen 9 game. Violet is also available at a discount, if just a slight bit more expensive at $37.59. Both of these run incredibly on Switch 2, so I'd highly recommend playing them on the new console if you can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also Legends Arceus, Sword, and Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee, all available at a reduced price today. But, and this is a big but, these are <strong>certified Pokémon Day deals</strong> that <em>will </em>expire by the end of today (February 27, 11:59 PM CT, to be exact). I wouldn't be surprised is several sell out even before then, so act fast to avoid disappointment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is IGN's Senior Commerce Editor and resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.
