But, according to the publisher of Clair Obscur, not only did Oblivion <em>not</em> harm Clair Obscur, Clair Obscur actually benefitted from Oblivion’s release because it boosted excitement for the RPG genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So says Kepler Interactive’s senior portfolio manager Matt Handrahan, who told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/expedition-33-publisher-elder-scrolls" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a> all about Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s launch success against the odds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, some background. RPG fans were faced with the difficult choice between spending hundreds of hours in Oblivion’s Cyrodiil, or embarking on an expedition to take down the Paintress in Clair Obscur. The launch of the two games in the same week provoked both joyful and frustrated reactions from RPG fans, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-publisher-acknowledges-the-barbenheimer-energy-of-releasing-the-same-week-as-oblivion-remastered">a cheeky comment from Kepler Interactive itself</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an X/Twitter post, Kepler shared an edited image of the characters from Clair Obscur walking into an Oblivion Gate, with the text "omg its like barbenheimer" in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/internet-embraces-barbenheimer-memes-mashups-more"><u>humorous nod to the simultaneous release of the films Barbie and Oppenheimer in theatres on the same day in 2023</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">omg its like barbenheimer <a href="https://t.co/TN1AFzdggc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/TN1AFzdggc</a></p>— Kepler Interactive (@Kepler_Interact) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kepler_Interact/status/1914703225652945047?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft, which owns Oblivion developer Bethesda and which had heavily backed Clair Obscur since its reveal at an Xbox Showcase last year, also came under fire for shadow-dropping Oblivion on top of Clair Obscur, with both games being Game Pass day-one titles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, according to Handrahan, there was nothing to worry about. “We always knew that Expedition 33 had a very specific identity,” Handrahan said. “When I was in the press, I saw the Western-style RPG and the Japanese-style RPG as having quite different appeals and audiences. I knew plenty of people that would play an Elder Scrolls game that wouldn't necessarily play Final Fantasy and vice versa.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Also, by the time that we rolled around, we had momentum of our own and we felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Pass… so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game. We were confident in that. And it went as well as it possibly could have done in our eyes. And, actually, proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur has become a big hit for Keplar and its French developer, Sandfall Interactive, selling over 1 million copies in just three days and posting impressive concurrent player numbers on Steam. It’s done so well that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/french-president-macron-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-for-creating-one-of-the-best-rated-games-in-history">French President Macron has praised the development team</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda has announced Oblivion Remastered has seen over 4 million players since launch, but hasn’t announced a sales figure. It too has seen big Steam concurrent player numbers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Business quoted data from Ampere that shows 35% of Clair Obscur players also played Oblivion remastered, which means there was significant overlap. A lot of that has to do with both games launching in Game Pass, with the overlap percentage dropping for Steam and PlayStation 5 players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Oblivion Remastered, including a report on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-player-escapes-the-confines-of-cyrodiil-to-explore-valenwood-skyrim-and-even-hammerfell-the-rumored-setting-of-the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>a player who managed to escape the confines of Cyrodiil to explore Valenwood, Skyrim, and even Hammerfell, the rumored setting of The Elder Scrolls VI</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've also got a comprehensive guide to everything you'll find in Oblivion Remastered, including an expansive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/cyrodiil"><u>Interactive Map</u></a>, complete Walkthroughs for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Main_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>Main Questline</u></a> and every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Guilds"><u>Guild Quest</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Character_Building_Guide"><u>How to Build the Perfect Character</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Things_to_Do_First_in_Oblivion"><u>Things to Do First</u></a>, every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/PC_Cheats_and_Console_Commands"><u>PC Cheat Code</u></a>, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Clair Obscur, be sure to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/clair-obscur-expedition-33/Tips_-_Things_Clair_Obscur_Doesn't_Tell_You"><u>check out our tips for the important things to know before </u></a>heading into the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-glory-of-team-rocket-single-prices-crashed-japanese<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-destined-rivals-preorder-guide-2025">Destined Rivals to land in the US on May 30</a>, collectors are already snapping up singles from the Japanese Glory of Team Rocket sets, and now’s the perfect time to join them. The initial hype has peaked, and bloated prices are falling fast. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t just the usual post-release cooldown, it's a mix of wider stock availability and Pokébro investors moving on, making it far more affordable to pick up cards individually rather than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-may-1-2025">gambling on overpriced sealed boxes</a> (no matter how appealing that is!). Here's why buying singles could be the smart move for collectors in the US right now.</p><p id="tldr-japanese-single-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TL;DR: Japanese Single Cards">TL;DR: Single Card Prices Are Crashing</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just look at the current value of Japanese booster boxes for The Glory of Team Rocket set, more than double the shelf price right now. We haven't seen overpricing like this since 151, but I think we're looking at the light at the end of the tunnel for stock <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-booster-bundle-shining-fates-amazon-restock-latest">shortages of Pokémon TCG</a> worldwide. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take Team Rocket's <a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3m5W?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mewtwo ex SIR for example</a>; sold listing were at the $500 mark starting 20th April, which has nose dived down to around $370.77 over the past couple of days. A strong start when it comes to market correction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there's <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGlk8?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Moltres ex SIR</a>, going from a few sales at around $250 to $163. Granted, it's not a dramatic drop, but that's a $87 drop in the space of a week or so. Not bad. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-april-30-2025">These price drops</a> happening sooner shows us that more scalpers are leaving our hobby, which means <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-april-25-2025">artificial bloating on release is down.</a></p><p id="most-affordable"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Most Affordable">Most Affordable Team Rocket Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not all about the ridiculously expensive chase cards however, with Glory of Team Rocket's Super Rare ex and Hyper Rare ex variants looking stunning. These cards are usually over looked in each set, which is great for trainers like me and you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, we can see that it's not just us thinking this with certain cards like <a href="https://zdcs.link/98LwDL?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Mewtwo Super Rare ex</a>, which has climbed in value by $6 and change since release to $38.75. Following Journey Together's artstyle of the full color Pokémon with an outline of their trainer in the background, these cards are worth snapping up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe it's just a Mewtwo thing? <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEjZ0y?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Nidoking Super Rare ex</a> is performing as expected, dropping from $26 with some stability at $12.94. it's an iconic card for generation one fans and watchers of the first season of the Pokémon anime, not to mention it looks more menacing than Brock with a frying pan. This is one of those cards to buy now and watch it climb down the road, the same goes for Moltres and Crowbat.</p><p id="best-trainer-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Trainer Cards">Best Team Rocket Trainer Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-game-sale-switch-2-woot">peak nostalgia here from generation one</a> and two here, specifically Giovanni and Ariana. The former being the don of Team Rocket who players take down in Kanto, and Ariana serving as the second interim boss of Team Rocket in Johto. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's not much data on <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoXZqA?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Giovanni 129/098 right now</a>, but it features Team Rocket's leadership alongside the boss himself. It's likely to hold it's value at around the $17 mark, so if it comes up cheaper, grab it. A rule of thumb with this set; if it's Giovanni or Mewtwo, expect to pay out of your nose for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aN4vWV?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Ariana 128/098</a> is a stunning artwork variant of the standard trainer art, sporting prices between $17 and $18 and rightly so. Again, the set hasn't been out long enough to judge the value of this card properly, but any listing for under $18 is a good deal right now.</p><p id="best-art-rares"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Art Rares">Best Team Rocket Art Rares</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the best artwork in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/youll-save-more-buying-single-paldean-fates-pokmon-cards">Scarlet and Violet era</a> belongs to illustration rares and art rares. They're cheap and look amazing, easily some of the most slept on cards in the TCG. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">If you're looking for your collection to span binders</a>, grow in value and look good whilst doing it? This is the way forward for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming in higher than most right now is Team Rocket's Meowth 109/098, sitting at around $19.25 at the time of writing. That's a fall of nearly $20 from the launch of The Glory of Team Rocket, which is to be expected so close to launch. But the link to this Pokémon and Team Rocket is iconic to say the least (Where the hell is Jesse and James in this set?). It looks like this card is still crashing, so anything below the $20 mark is an awesome deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some reason, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmXrE3?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blaziken 101/098</a> is crashing card right now. This artwork is incredible, showing off exactly why this generation three starter Pokémon is a fan favorite. These are usually all traits that go into a Pokémon card having a nice climb, which tells me this is a card to snap up rigt now. It's even playable thanks to it's Infernal Legs attacks, dealing 120 damage to your opponents active Pokémon and another 120 damage to a benched Pokémon. This card could literally snag a trainer two prize cards in one move, which is another reason why it should be worth more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you really want to open boosters of The Glory of Team Rocket despite the price tags and five card count of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-japanese-pokmon-tcg">Japanese packs</a>, go for it. But there's some serious bargains to be had on single cards. Just to note, pricing mentioned in this article are correct at the time of writing. Also, stock may go in and out due to TCG Player being a live secondary marketplace. But that's what makes it fun, right? If you missed the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/score-60-off-a-sams-club-membership-today-only-and-secure-sold-out-pokemon-tcg-sets-at-a-discount">Charizard Sam's club deal</a>, this it might be worth checking back in to see if it's still available.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Pokémon TCG Deals</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

But their latest breakthrough is perhaps the greatest yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tom, aka <a href="https://ko-fi.com/warhammerworkshop" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Workshop</a>, the modder behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/massive-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-mod-adds-lore-accurate-classes-a-weapon-previously-locked-to-campaign-and-even-new-operations"><u>Space Marine 2’s excellent Astartes Overhaul</u></a>, signaled the release of 12-player co-op this week and it looks fantastic. Gameplay footage shows multiple players taking on a Tyranid Trygon Prime in a battle reminiscent of an MMO boss fight.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is not something players thought possible, given vanilla Space Marine 2 supports up to three-player co-op only. But the modding team has not only broken through that barrier to hit 12-player co-op — with the support of developer Saber Interactive itself — but has a grand ambition to turn Space Marine 2 into something even better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Honestly, I’m just kind of in awe of Saber’s support for the modding community,” Tom told IGN. “None of us expected 12-player PvE sessions to be possible this soon — but somehow, here we are. Thanks to their generosity and trust, this huge leap forward is finally here, and it completely changes what we can do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth pointing out that the mod available right now is just a test — a test that works well, but a test nonetheless. 12-player co-op makes a mockery of Space Marine 2's PvE balance, which you'd expect given there are nine more players taking on the Tyranids and the Thousand Sons than Saber designed the encounters for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But with 12-player now unlocked, modders are building add-ons to make the most of it. Tom told IGN the team is working on modes such as prop hunt, PvP inside operations, “massive” horde mode updates for when the official horde mode finally launches, and, perhaps most exciting of all, raid-style missions “with bosses that hit like trucks, take proper teamwork to bring down, as well as some other completely new mechanics.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 modding has grown into a significant community, with some 20,000 tinkerers in the main Discord server.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As both a modder and a player, it’s hard not to be excited,” Tom continued. “Huge credit as always to the Saber team for not just making all this possible, but continuing to drop amazing content of their own too, without any of the usual predatory battle-pass nonsense we take for granted in modern titles.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/01/sm2-1746137803550.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Could this 12-player Space Marine 2 mod give us an idea of what to expect from Space Marine 3?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an exciting time for Space Marine 2 generally, with the aforementioned horde mode coming soon, a new class in the works, and of course more Operations maps and weapons. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-patch-8-detailed-horde-mode-mechanics-and-map-revealed">Saber recently detailed Patch 8</a>, confirmed some horde mode mechanics, and revealed the map it’s set on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive"><u>Space Marine 3 is officially in development, too,</u></a> which is no surprise given just how well Space Marine 2 has done. And I'm left wondering whether this 12-player co-op mod might give us an indication of what to expect from the sequel. When Space Marine 3 was announced, we were told to expect "large-scale battles that are even more spectacular." That sounds a lot like upping the co-op player count limit to me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until we find out, modders will be around to keep things fresh and interesting, and this latest effort is a perfect example of just that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-keeps-its-fans-in-the-loop-with-overwatch-2-stadium-summer-roadmap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard Entertainment has unveiled its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2"><u>Overwatch 2</u></a> Stadium roadmap for 2025, teasing some of the heroes and features it plans to add in Season 17, Season 18, Season 19, and beyond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team behind the pioneering hero shooter dived into the details of its new mode’s past, present, and future with <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24198087/directors-take-past-present-and-future-of-stadium" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Director’s Take blog post</a> from game director Aaron Keller. It comes with a surprise summer roadmap now that the mode has been available for a little longer than a week, while also clarifying how the mode got its start and how it’s performed so far.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Stadium Gets 7 New Heroes This Summer</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Stadium rollout will press forward when new Damage hero Freja joins its limited roster with a mid-season patch for Season 16, but it’s Season 17 in June that will really kick things up a notch. Junkrat, Sigma, and Zenyatta will be added to the strategic multiplayer mode’s list of playable heroes at this time, bringing along the Esperança Push map and Samoa Control map with them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard will also use this time to further flesh out how Stadium works by adding in things like Unranked Crossplay, new all-star rewards, custom games, additional example builds, and an option to save and share builds. It’s unclear if all heroes and features will arrive at the start of Season 17 or if they will be released throughout the season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 18 sends in Overwatch’s gorilla icon, Winston, as a playable character, with Sojourn and Brigitte set to join, too. Route 66 and London maps will also join the pool at this time, as will a Payload Race game mode, which comes with two new maps, a Stadium trials feature, and, finally, the freedom to Endorse your teammates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard’s transparency regarding Stadium’s development comes with the assurance that “multiple new heroes,” both from Overwatch 2’s existing roster and characters that have yet to be revealed, will be added to the mode every season. For Season 19 and beyond, a new China map is on the way, with a Draft Mode feature, consumables, item system tweaks, and more also in the works.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/01/ow2-2025-stadium-roadmap-1920x1080-sa04-1746118213808.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Overwatch 2 Stadium summer 2025 roadmap. Image courtesy of Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2">How has Stadium Performed so Far?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Overwatch 2 team also shared Stadium stats that reveal how players have decided to spend their time with Blizzard’s new mode. It’s currently “eclipsing” Quick Play and Competitive, making it Overwatch 2’s most played mode with 2.3 million matches played across 7.8 million hours during launch week alone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It secures the lengthy game mode’s stats at more than double what was seen with Overwatch Classic’s launch week. Other interesting stats crown Lucio as both the hero with the highest win rate and the lowest pick rate, while players have managed to spend 900 billion Stadium Cash when choosing 206 million items for their builds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keller’s Director’s Take touches on a few important details related to the development of Stadium, too. One important note saw the game director confirming the mode has been in development before Overwatch 2 launched. Though the team has touched on this timeline in the past, his comment should help squash prevailing fan theories that Stadium was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-dev-blizzard-welcomes-marvel-rivals-competition-says-its-never-faced-another-game-so-similar-to-the-one-weve-created"><u>born out of Blizzard’s desire to compete with Marvel Rivals</u></a>, which launched December 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keller says Blizzard will keep up the communication going forward, promising to release more insight into Stadium next week with an additional Director’s take. Meanwhile, he also confirms that, while Stadium has entered the discussion as a massively popular addition to Overwatch 2, Blizzard remains committed to maintaining other core experiences such as standard Quick Play and Competitive options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Before signing off, I'd like to reiterate the team’s commitment to the Core modes of Overwatch," Keller clarified. "We’re still pouring as much time, energy and passion into these as we always have. Stadium isn't competing for those resources: it’s giving us more opportunities to deliver Overwatch in a new, exciting way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We can't wait for you to see what's coming there, especially Season 18. It's going to be a banger! Have fun with Stadium and, as always, let’s make a great game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch 2 brought Stadium to players when Season 16 launched last week. It’s part of Blizzard’s ongoing initiative to reinvigorate its player base, which began with an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reveals-radical-overhaul-of-overwatch-2-including-return-of-loot-boxes-perks-and-third-person-mode"><u>all-encompassing Spotlight presentation</u></a> in February. It’s led to the return of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-overwatch-fans-are-thrilled-loot-boxes-are-coming-back-some-not-so-much"><u>loot boxes</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-becoming-the-worst-user-reviewed-game-ever-on-steam-overwatch-2s-recent-reviews-jump-to-mixed"><u>an improved Steam rating</u></a> as players celebrate <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-years-of-struggle-blizzard-has-found-itself-in-uncharted-territory-overwatch-players-are-having-fun-again"><u>what some feel is the best Overwatch experience fans have seen in years</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for more udpates, you can check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/overwatch-2/Overwatch_2_Stadium_Details">our guide to learn more about how Stadium works</a>.
