That's just $1 off its best price ever ($139.98), and a brilliant offer to kick off the year with.</p><div id="226402"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="226402" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Edge of Eternities - Play Booster Box (30 Packs)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon Has Big Discounts on Magic: The Gathering Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">However, that's not all. You can also find some of the most recent 2025 Universes Beyond sets, like Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Marvel's Spider-Man, at low, low prices right now as well. That includes Spidey's Play Booster Box, which is available for just over $110. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's a pretty big discount compared to the almost $210 asking price back when preorders kicked off last year, just about $100, in fact. Avatar only came out in November, and you can already pick up its Play Boosters for even less than Edge of Eternities, and now just $134.99 at Amazon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also score the Collectors versions of these Universes Beyond sets as well, both of which have seen tidy price drops since last year, and are your best bet of finding the rarest cards from each set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l3ejx?object_uuid=909374ef-0098-4816-a3af-1eaaf3327728&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Play Boosters</a> are now the standard way to crack open Magic packs, having replaced both Set and Draft Boosters. But if you're on the hunt for rare cards, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7A2Y?object_uuid=909374ef-0098-4816-a3af-1eaaf3327728&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Collector Boosters</a> are the best option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These packs are more expensive, but are much more likely to include various foil treatments, extended arts, and all sorts. There are usually 5 Commons, 4 Uncommons, 5 Rare or Mythic Rare cards, a Land and a Token, but the rub here is that 6 of the included cards have a 'booster Fun frame' and 12-13 of them are foil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of 2026 sets, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game"><u>Magic's</u></a> highly anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-where-to-buy-2026"><u>Lorwyn Eclipsed set</u></a> is getting closer as well, but we can already expect another trip to New York not long after in March. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On that note, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-just-discounted-magics-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-set-to-its-lowest-price-ever">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Booster Box preorders</a> are also discounted right now at Amazon (out March 23), down to the lowest price so far at $148.20 (and down from $209.70).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other TCG news, there are also some great deals on Pokémon cards right now at Amazon and TCGplayer, including a great deal on the most recent expansion's ETB, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-phantasmal-flames-elite-trainer-box">Mega Evolution - Phantasmal Flames</a>. It's down to its lowest price ever at Amazon after its market price took a mighty tumble over the New Year, dropping almost 50% in a matter of weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unsurprisingly, stock is still running low on Amazon for a lot of Pokémon cards, even from last year, and even upcoming MTG sets like Lorwyn and TMNT. That said, sites like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-where-to-buy">TCGplayer</a> still have a solid supply, and in some cases, better prices too, so are definitely worth checking out while on your hunt for cheap boosters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.
