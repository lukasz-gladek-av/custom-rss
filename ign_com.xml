I either go on a second scuba dive or I go to the gym and work out. Then I work. I live on a boat, so I just hang out with everybody on the boat."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I work seven days a week," he added. "I'm working from my bedroom, as you can tell. I like working. It's fun. To me, it doesn't feel like work. The kinds of things that I get to do every day are super awesome. I've said it before, but when you retire, you want to stop doing your horrible job and then go do what is most fun and entertaining. And so in that sense, I've been retired for a long time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expanding on the types of work that keep him busy these days, Newell said: "Getting to work with Drew and Jeremy on AI stuff or Chris on Steam stuff... In one of the companies, we're working on an aerosol pathogen detection device so you can see all the pathogens that are in the air. Brain computer interfaces are incredibly cool, and all of the associated neuroscience is incredibly cool. So, I just work all the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But it's not like, 'Oh my God, I'm up late at night slaving away on stuff.' It's more like I can't go to sleep because I'm having fun, you know?"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve, the studio behind seminal hits like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life"><u>Half-Life</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/left-4-dead"><u>Left 4 Dead</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dota-2"><u>Dota 2</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/counter-strike"><u>Counter-Strike</u></a>, is also the company behind the industry-leading Steam online game platform, plus the acclaimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/steam-deck"><u>Steam Deck</u></a> handheld system.

The launch of this higher age restriction, following the earlier introduction of localised age ratings in 2016, has helped smooth GTA 5's belated path to release — alongside a bit of help from Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive to grease the wheels. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A recently-agreed partnership between Take-Two and a Saudi firm, the Advanced Initiative Company, will see the latter now act as the local distributor for all Take-Two titles, including GTA 5, WWE 2K, NBA 2K and Red Dead Redemption. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The countries, with a combined population of around 44 million, will presumably now also become a market in which Rockstar can sell GTA 6, when it finally arrives. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After more than a decade in development and a recent major delay, GTA 6 is currently set to launch on May 9, 2026, pending any further hold-ups.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Connelly was also found to have "deliberately inflated" his company's financial position during the first few months of the pandemic in 2020, reporting a turnover of $201,500 (£150,00) in 2019 when it was, in fact, $77,900 (£58,00).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In interviews with the Insolvency Service, Connelly stated that he had been given the opportunity to reimagine the music for the Tomb Raider soundtrack, describing it as a "significant project which had the potential to be very lucrative." He reportedly took out personal loans and sold his car to finance the work, but that "stalled" at the start of the pandemic. By August 2021, Connelly's company, Peter Connelly Limited, had gone into liquidation.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-104937-1752832212394.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Peter Connelly is best known for his work on the Tomb Raider series at Core Design.
