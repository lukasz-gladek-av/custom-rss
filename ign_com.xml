            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-are-out-now-and-its-already-exploding-on-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Don't forget — beware of spoilers!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deltarune-full-release">Deltarune</a>, the multi-chapter sequel to 2015's indie smash hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/undertale">Undertale</a>, is currently blowing up on Steam thanks to the release of Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 this morning after years of anticipation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game itself has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/31/undertale-creator-announces-and-releases-mysterious-new-project">out in some format since 2018</a>, when creator Toby Fox posted a series of cryptic tweets before dropping an innocuous download entitled "SURVEY PROGRAM." That download turned out to be the first chapter of a new game, Deltarune, the name of which is an anagram for Undertale. After a cryptic introduction, the player controls a teenager named Kris who, with their school bully Susie, is dropped into a mysterious Dark World and tasked with saving its citizens by a goat-child named Ralsei.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapter-2-release-date-this-week-pc-mac">second chapter manifested in 2021</a>, revealing something like an adventure-of-the-week format where Kris and Susie repeatedly visit the Dark World in each chapter, meet a new villain, defeat them alongside Ralsei, and return home. In total, the game is expected to have at least seven total chapters, and we've known three and four were coming today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-are-launching-alongside-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-june">since Fox announced it in April.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune, like Undertale, is a turn-based RPG with bullet hell mechanics, and features a cast of both new and returning characters from its predecessor. However, its connection to Undertale itself is mysterious — the characters themselves have key differences from their Undertale versions, no one seems aware of the events of Undertale, and yet the game frequently winks and nods to Undertale's events in a way that players of both will recognize, even if its in-universe cast doesn't.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the game itself is beloved for its zany humor, lovable characters, unique combat, and fantastic soundtrack, much of what fuels the nearly-rabid online interest is related to the mystery of what, precisely, Deltarune <em>is</em>, and how it will ultimately connect with or solve some of the latent mysteries of Undertale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of this writing, Deltarune already has over 100,000 players on Steam and is the 10th most-played game on Valve's platform. It's already surpassed the peak Steam player count of the free Deltarune Chapter 1 and 2 demo, despite costing $25. It's the top-selling game on Steam right now by revenue, ahead of the likes of Counter-Strike 2, Elden Ring: Nightreign, and Dune: Awakening. But its true popularity will be much bigger, given Deltarune is also out on PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox Series consoles now, and its Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 versions launch tonight at midnight when the Switch 2 officially releases.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The game's original Save the World portion will still not be available, however, as it has never been sold on Nintendo platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next main Fortnite update, version 37.00, will add mouse controls when Epic makes it available to download this Saturday, June 7. As you'd expect, by default your mouse will replace the right analog stick and allow you to look using the Joy-Con 2's optical sensor instead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mouse controls will be unlocked for all major Fortnite modes (Battle Royale, Zero Build, Team Rumble, Reload, Reload - Zero Build, Fortnite OG and Fortnite OG Zero Build). You'll also be able to use mouse controls in menus.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/04/fortnite-festival-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080-20f075c3fc48-1749049852625.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite: Switch 2 Edition.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/04/fortnite-festival-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080-20f075c3fc48-1749049852625.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite: Switch 2 Edition.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/04/fortnite-festival-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080-20f075c3fc48-1749049852625.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite: Switch 2 Edition.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/04/fortnite-festival-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080-20f075c3fc48-1749049852625.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite: Switch 2 Edition.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a welcome to Switch 2, anyone playing Fortnite on Nintendo's new console from now until March 31, 2026 will unlock an exclusive emote, Wishing Star, which Epic Games describes thus: <strong>"</strong>Grab a shooting star, make a wish, and throw it back! You can’t go on an air ride with it, but it’s the next best thing." Nice Kirby reference there! One day, maybe, we'll get Nintendo characters properly in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite is available right now on Switch 2, as the console launches around the world. Currently, the game is in the closing stages of its Star Wars season Galactic Battle, which is set to wrap up this Saturday with a one-time live event where players get to sneak aboard the Death Star. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a busy week for Epic Games, which has been talking about the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ai-prompts-will-soon-let-a-10-person-team-build-a-game-like-breath-of-the-wild-where-the-ai-is-doing-all-the-dialogue-and-you-just-write-character-synopsis-tim-sweeney-predicts">future of AI in its Unreal Engine and in Fortnite</a> following the recent release of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-has-only-been-live-for-an-hour-and-already-epic-has-patched-out-him-saying-fk">very chatty AI-powered Darth Vader</a>.

However, the higher cost comes with “improved performance with higher frame rate and resolution”, as stated on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Switch-2/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-games-2785636.html?srsltid=AfmBOornJness6tz-vY0ULsPhlblXyfVcGwlennGOl2fvFmXb86DfegR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Nintendo’s list of upgraded Switch 2 games</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violets-switch-2-upgrade-is-massive-and-it-bodes-well-for-legends-z-a"><u>Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet Switch vs Switch 2 comparison</u></a> is anything to go by, following our first look at the older game’s free update, the new console’s upgraded hardware will make the higher price tag worthwhile. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some older Switch games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"><u>Breath of the Wild</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom"><u>Tears of the Kingdom</u></a> have the option to buy an upgrade pack for the Switch 2, those two being for £7.99 each, it’s currently unconfirmed as to whether Pokemon Legends: Z-A will have the same option. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on that pricing, though, it’s possible the Legends: Z-A upgrade pack will cost even more since it will be a brand-new game. While still in stock at The Game Collection, we’d recommend jumping on this lower price for the Switch 2 edition now, so you won’t have to worry about potentially paying more in the future. </p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 4, 2025 2:28 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
