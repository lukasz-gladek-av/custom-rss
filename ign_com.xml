            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"It would be a disaster if everyone tried to match them."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As the debate over the price of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> rages on, one developer of the original Saints Row — itself heavily inspired by GTA — has said he hopes Rockstar charges $100 for it, insisting it’s the only game in the world that can get away with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Strauss Zelnick, boss of Rockstar parent company Take-Two, is often asked how much Rockstar will charge for what is expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time. And each time he’s asked, Zelnick dances around the question, pointing to delivering value for customers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adding fuel to the scrutiny is the industry's recent jump from $70 to $80 for some games. If Nintendo is charging $80 for Nintendo Switch 2 games like Mario Kart World, and Microsoft, as many expect, jumps to $80 for its games from next year after backtracking on doing just that this year, then it's hard to see GTA 6 priced any cheaper.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans often baulk at the idea of forking out $100 for GTA 6. But according to Chris Stockman, the design director of the first Saints Row game, GTA 6 “deserves” to be $100.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/10/saints-row-creator-interview-gta-vi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esports Insider</a>, Stockman responded to the suggestion that GTA 6 will be the first $100 video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They’re the only ones that can get away with it, Stockman said. “I don’t think it’s a rising tide that floats all boats. I think that there’ll be a tremendous amount of backlash if everyone switched to $100. Not all games are created equal. I think GTA is the only one that can get away with it, and I hope they do. I really hope it’s $100. I think it deserves to be $100.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The scope and magnitude of this production deserves that price tag, but not everything is treated equally. It would be a disaster if everyone tried to match them.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Stockman here is saying the sheer scope of GTA 6 will be of a magnitude higher than any video game before it. Certainly it’s rumored to have the largest development budget of all time. Rockstar has barely shown any of the game, so it’s unclear exactly how big and varied an experience it will be. But it seems like a safe bet that barring the worst disaster in video game history, GTA 6 will rewrite the record books when it comes to critical and commercial acclaim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But is the world ready for the jump to $100? Earlier this year, a $100 GTA 6 was mooted by Epyllion CEO and analyst Matthew Ball in a <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>lengthy presentation on the state of gaming in 2025</u></a>. Near <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-price-many-in-the-video-game-industry-hope-for-80-if-not-100-analyst-says"><u>the end of the presentation</u></a>, Ball said that “some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80 to $100, breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to do $70, $70 to $80 etc."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Packaged game prices have never been lower in real terms than they are today — even though budgets are at all-time highs and player growth is stalled,” Ball wrote. “GTA 6 could re-establish packed video game prices after decades of deflation despite rampant cost growth.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-at-100-would-be-a-bridge-too-far-even-for-grand-theft-auto"><u>Other analysts have poured cold water on the $100 suggestion though</u></a>, saying that such is the huge excitement around GTA 6 that there’s simply no need to limit the game’s potential audience by pricing some out of the experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, recently published research claimed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-will-gta-6-cost-new-research-claims-100-price-point-would-actually-leave-money-on-the-table">if Rockstar were to go with $100 for GTA 6, it would actually cost the company money</a>, with the revenue “sweet spot” remaining $70.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Price is just one of the many unanswered questions swirling around GTA 6. Another is what Rockstar plans to do with GTA Online. Could the company charge more for access to GTA Online? Will it be a standalone free download? Could Rockstar sell a subscription? Will Rockstar and Take-Two really keep GTA Online available at no additional cost, as before?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopefully it won’t be long before we get answers. GTA 6 is due out May 26, 2026, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-a-finally-introduces-unique-nurse-joys-to-pokmon-centers</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-finally-introduces-unique-nurse-joys-to-pok%C3%A9mon-centers.1326361/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">You, too, can be Nurse Joy!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pokémon world can feel a bit idyllic at times to imagine, especially when you think of the free universal healthcare via magic healing machines provided to all Pokémon at any Pokémon Center. Since the very first games, these Pokémon Centers have been staffed by a roster of completely identical women (skin, hair, eyes, expression, everything!), all known in the anime as Nurse Joy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, for the first time, working Nurse Joys can be a little different.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/20251014074504-01k7h8gfppvwt1x8pcq13w39ep-1760445962517.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends: Z-A introduces unique Nurse Joys at every Pokémon Center for the first time in a Pokémon game. While the first one you're likely to encounter looks like a fairly standard Joy, every woman staffing a Center has slightly different features: different skin tones, different eyes, different mouths, and different eyebrows. They're all still in the same uniform and still sporting the same red loopy pigtails, but they now are giving a lot less pre-1980s Rockette.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/20251014074510-01k7h8kvje3ty85f9mg0h8f4gt-1760445973448.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This is in keeping with one of the features I've really enjoyed about Z-A so far: its character diversity. In past Pokemon games, towns could start to look a little samey, as every character of a single trainer class would have the exact same features copy-pasted. That has started to change in more recent games, but Scarlet and Violet took a bit of a step backward by dressing most of its cast in samey uniforms, again creating the illusion that every character looked the same.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/20251014074506-01k7h8haxt6zfk1n7n6s1zb79w-1760445984566.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Z-A, though, not only do NPCs all have different facial features, their outfits can change things up a bit too. You still might see a couple of matching characters here or there, but I've spotted athletes sprinting through town in different colored workout gear, and artists with different colored aprons. It's a small touch, but it adds a lot to the feeling that Lumiose City is actually populated by real people and not a lot of weird clones.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/20251014074509-01k7h8jbfn3de0vymx10rezge0-1760445998106.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">So congrats to every woman who didn't look exactly like the original Nurse Joy in Pokémon Red and Blue (read: every woman), the job is now open to you, if you want it! Sorry to the gents though, as I still haven't seen any men in the profession. Hopefully next game we can move into the 21st century on that front.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">review-in-progress of Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is now live, if you want to check out my impressions of the first 24 hours, with a full review coming next week.

Here's a video from 17 years ago where I interviewed him about Ninja Gaiden II for Xbox 360. <a href="https://t.co/Wqgzo6cFad" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Wqgzo6cFad</a></p>— Danny Peña (@godfree) <a href="https://twitter.com/godfree/status/1978747848750714957?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Born in 1967, Itagaki joined Tecmo in 1992, originally to handle the graphics for Tecmo Super Bowl. Itagaki's brash nature wasn't fully seen until he started on his own Dead or Alive series in 1998, which featured female characters with strategically-placed "bounce" physics and more than a passing resemblance to SEGA's Virtua Fighter, a series he has mentioned being a fan of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Dead or Alive 2 arrived for the Dreamcast, the graphical leap shone a light on Itagaki and Team Ninja, and the outspoken developer — who became well known for wearing shades at all times — never shied away from commenting on industry trends. Itagaki's Ninja Gaiden launched as an Xbox exclusive in 2004, breathing new life into the hardcore action game franchise. He went on to release Ninja Gaiden Black, considered by some to be one of the greatest action games of all time. Nintendo DS game Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword, and Xbox 360 exclusive Ninja Gaiden 2 followed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/06/03/itagaki-resigns">Itagaki split from Tecmo</a> as part of a heated and very public breakup on June 2, 2008.
