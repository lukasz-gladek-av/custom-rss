            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who has loved dragons for longer than I can remember, including rocking dragon button-up shirts in high school as my “style” and theming my son’s bedroom around the scaled creatures, I was happy as a wyrm and his hoard when Wizards revealed they were releasing Dragon Delves: Adventure Anthology for Dungeons &amp; Dragons. This collection puts front and center one of the namesakes of the TTRPG, featuring 10 adventures, while also highlighting the legacy of the creatures in this long-running franchise. After peeling back the pages and seeing what it has to offer, I find this book to be a fine addition to my shelf, but I wish it went further to really give these mythical creatures the celebration they deserve.</p><div catalogid="95c08acb-b2b8-42d6-9e49-69e7fa2c79c4" id="225650"><div id="225650" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dragon Delves (D&amp;D Adventure Anthology)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Delves is a collection of 10 short adventures, each one focused around chromatic (Green, Red, Blue, White, Black) or Metallic (Gold, Silver, Brass, Bronze, Copper) dragons that can be dropped into your existing campaigns or played back-to-back in a campaign that takes players from novice level 1 heroes up to level 12. It would have been nice if the designers offered some manner or tips, or recommendations for GMs to adjust the included quests for higher levels, but worst case, you could always just choose higher level enemies of a similar style, young dragons instead of wyrmlings, for example, to raise the challenge.  There is a good variety of quests in this anthology, from solving mysteries behind corruption, sentient bags of holding, or uncovering forgotten verses of a song, but all of them will, at some point, have you and your party cross paths with a dragon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All but one really hit for me. The one that didn't is the Gold Dragon’s adventure, “Baker’s Doesn't,” which involves a golden dragon named Briochebane that bakes bread, and has the party dealing with animated candy creations and visiting places like Candied Apple Orchards and Taffy Factories. Outlandish and silly in TTRPGs isn’t an automatic turn-off for me. Hell, in my own homebrew campaign, the party encountered an island of sentient vegetables and took a cauliflower puppy back with them. But in the scheme of Dragon Delves, this quest just doesn’t feel like it belongs among quests like “Death at Sunset” or “Shivering Death”. That said, its whimsical nature could be perfect for a little jaunt in the Feywild or to add a bit of levity to your campaign after an emotionally-packed couple of sessions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This book's real strength is how easy it makes it to drop the adventures into a campaign. Each of the 10 stories has been designed to last only one or two sessions, with the first page of each one providing simple and clear directions on where these can be dropped in, the level of characters it is for, the general plot points, how to prepare, and what state blocks you will need.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This book's real strength is how easy it makes it to drop the adventures into a campaign.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, the Silver Dragon’s “The Will of Orcus” adventure states, “It can take place anywhere there are mountains and settlements,” and is for level 4 characters. All of those important bits of information you need can be gleaned from just a quick glance. As a GM, the faster I can get the info, the better, and I think the layout and design are wonderfully done here in Dragon Delves (and honestly, all of the updated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-dungeons-and-dragons-books">2025 5th edition books</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing of note, while this anthology contains the details of the adventures, it does <em>not</em> have any stat blocks for the creatures, so whoever is running these will also need the Monster Manual (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QObWlM?object_uuid=450dc3bd-3d44-47f6-b69a-cf14e99c5ce7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>) – either 5th Edition book will suffice. The fact that this book doesn’t contain any unique stat blocks is a bit of a bummer. I would have loved to have blocks for each of the 10 dragons that are the focus of each one, which would give them something slightly unique or tweaked from their stock counterparts in the Monster Manual. Also, where are my updated gem dragons at, Wizards?!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the quests, this book also showcases how the visuals and designs of each dragon have evolved over the course of Dungeons &amp; Dragons' nearly five-decade-long lifespan. I appreciate the two-page spread of artwork, but when I heard that this book would also showcase the history of the dragon types, I expected more. I would have loved to see blurbs from Wizards’ designers on how, if any, the approach and gameplay design of the various types have shifted or changed over the years. How has Wizards approached its stat blocks, or despite “dragons” being in the franchise's name, why is the team as reserved in showcasing or highlighting them? Much of this art I could obtain simply by searching Google; give me the information or material that has been hoarded away in the Wizards’ vaults. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether they are spewing acid, lightning, or breathing the more traditional fire, dragons have been, and always will be, really, really cool. There is a reason that these scaled creatures have become so closely ingrained and intertwined with the fantasy genre. Dragon Delves: Adventure Anthology gives players some relatively quick outings to enjoy and drop into their story whenever parties have a hankering for some dragon goodness. That said, this book never reached the heights of excitement I had imagined when I first heard about it. The fact that it relies solely on the basic stat blocks from the Monster Manual and there aren’t any fun adventures for higher-level parties is a bit disappointing. The fact that Tiamat, arguably the most recognizable dragon in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, is absent is also a strange omission.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Devles comes off more as a great introductory package for dragons, and for newer or younger players just <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-dungeons-and-dragons">learning how to play D&amp;D</a>, it's a fun collection of quick stories. But for more experienced players, or those hoping for setups for big confrontations with some ancient dragons, you may want to look elsewhere. Personally, I was hoping for and expecting more, but hopefully this anthology just marks the beginning of more dragon-centric books and campaigns to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Unfortunately, it also soft locks your game.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has been out for a week now, and speedrunners are already figuring out incredibly fast ways to beat the game in as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcjkdLofDYg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">little as an hour and a half</a>. While they're sure to find ways to cut that time down even more in the coming weeks and months, one really interesting trick has been discovered with a strange side effect: it skips getting Pauline as DK's companion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning! </strong></em><em>Spoilers for the ending of Donkey Kong Bananza's Lagoon Layer follow. Read on at your own risk!</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a normal playthrough, Pauline bursts out of Odd Rock near the end of the Lagoon Layer when she and DK play music together and activate DK's Kong Bananza transformation. It's a critical story moment both in that it actually introduces Pauline into the story proper, but also because the cutscene is required to get Kong Elder to open the door to the next layer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, speedrunners have found a trick that lets them skip the whole thing. The drop to the next layer is hidden in a building that DK can actually clip into under the right circumstances. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIvPjCDwvLU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This video</a> shows the trick in action, but it essentially involves hanging from a pipe close to a barred window into the building, and rapidly entering and exiting Photo Mode to get DK to clip through the bars and into the room with the hole. This works regardless of whether DK has Pauline or not, which means DK and Odd Rock can journey to the next layer together without progressing the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately for Odd Rock lovers out there, you can't actually progress the game much farther this way. The next sublayer is a boss fight arena, and while you can collect a few Banandium Gems in there with Odd Rock's support, the boss won't actually spawn if you don't have Pauline with you. Weirdly, you will hear a bit of Pauline's (not Odd Rock's) dialogue as you approach the arena, but with no boss to fight there's also no way to manifest the big hole in the ground that leads to the next main layer. So you're soft locked until you go back and properly get Pauline.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, knowing how fast speedrunners work at breaking these things, I wouldn't be surprised if we hear about them solving this new problem sometime soon and doing something that results in some crazy no-Pauline tricks, or maybe even ways to skip Odd Rock entirely. After all, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom runners <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-speedrunner-finds-a-way-to-play-as-link">figured out how to play as Link instead of Zelda</a>. Video games are just wacky like that sometimes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza is out now, and we love it, having <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">given the game a 10/10 in our review</a>. As our reviewer said, "Donkey Kong Bananza is a truly groundbreaking 3D platformer, with satisfying movement, powerful abilities, impressive destructible environments, and clever challenges that all come together in complete harmony to create Nintendo’s first Switch 2 masterpiece."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you, like us, can't get enough of Bananza, we have plenty of walkthroughs to aid your journey underground, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/donkey-kong-bananza/Banandium_Gems_(Banana_Locations)">Banandium Gem locations</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/donkey-kong-bananza/Essential_Tips_to_Get_Started">starter tips and tricks</a>, and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/donkey-kong-bananza/Walkthrough">full walkthrough</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Instead, today's look simply ended with word of a <em>further </em>reveal next week — this time of the game's multiplayer modes — on July 31.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, for Battlefield fans, today's big reveal provided some welcome reassurance that series staples such as large-scale destruction and vehicle-based combat featuring planes, trucks and tanks would once again return. We also got to see at least three helicopters crash in under three minutes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But today's trailer did not include confirmation of the game's now-leaked release date.

Picking up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-teaser-shows-nato-under-attack-and-includes-the-return-of-the-series-classic-theme">yesterday's tease of a new global mercenary group, Pax Armata</a>, which has threatened the world and targeted NATO, this fresh trailer saw the US fighting back amid attacks on its own soil. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For the Pax Armata mercenaries who are watching now, I have a message," the US president states, after nervously stepping up to the White House podium. "It's over."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a lengthy development and an array of development studios working on the project, it was intriguing to see Battlefield 6's first proper trailer begin with a nervous-sounding US leader behind the microphone.

He looks grizzled, angry, and holds a knife. I think he's a bad guy?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In recent months, footage of Battlefield 6 from various closed playtests has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-early-battlefield-6-footage-seems-to-have-leaked-online">started leaking online,</a> showing the game's modern setting, various firefights, destructible environments, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-improvements-and-features-revealed-by-the-battlefield-6-gameplay-leaks">quality of life improvements</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-battlefield-leak-reveals-extremely-brief-look-at-the-start-of-a-battle-royale-match-as-ea-issues-takedowns">start of a battle royale match</a>.

That’s some of the best pricing we’ve seen outside of limited restocks, and probably your best shot at avoiding inflated third-party listings (although it's still way over MSRP).</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in today’s deals, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is $799.99 at Best Buy, which is $500 off its usual price and a great buy for an unlocked flagship. ROG Ally is also down to $499.99 with the Z1 Extreme chip and 512GB storage, which makes it one of the better portable gaming options if you want full Windows access. Soundcore P20i earbuds are just $19.98, the Anker 332 Power Strip is $15.99, and the upgraded 100W Anker Nano Charging Station is $35.99.

Legends Z-A switches things up with real-time battles, an urban setting in Lumiose City, and the full return of Mega Evolutions, including 27 new forms like Mega Dragonite. The starter picks are a nice throwback, but what really caught my attention is the Z-A Royale system and Alpha Pokémon lurking across the city at night. Add in deep trainer customization and the Switch 2 upgrade option, and it’s clear the developers are trying to evolve more than just the Pokémon this time. If it plays as good as it sounds, this could be the next real shift for the series.</p></div><p id="black-bolt-elite-trainer-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box">Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225517"><div id="225517" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The fluxuations on this Elite Trainer Box has been crazy this week, but TCG Player finally has listings cheaper than Amazon starting at $91.50, around $20 cheaper than the big box giant.

The LED display is a nice bonus since you don’t have to guess how much battery life is left, and the bladeless design means no hair tangles. Five speed settings and up to 15 hours of runtime for under twenty bucks? That’s a win.</p></div><p id="fourth-wing-wing-and-claw-collectio"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fourth Wing (Wing and Claw Collectio">Fourth Wing (Wing and Claw Collection) (The Empyrean, 1)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225670"><div id="225670" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fourth Wing (Wing and Claw Collection) (The Empyrean, 1)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're collecting The Empyrean series, this new edition of Fourth Wing is worth a look.

The narration from Rebecca Soler adds a solid layer to the story, and this sequel dives straight into the brutality and politics of Basgiath without slowing down. Things are darker, the stakes are higher, and Violet’s got even more to lose.

Nolan’s trilogy still holds up as some of the best superhero filmmaking, and if you're going to own it this is the version to get.</p></div><p id="funko-pop-plus-the-lord-of-the-rin"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Funko Pop!
