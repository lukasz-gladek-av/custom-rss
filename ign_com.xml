            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plus, massive discounts on the PlayStation Store. </h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re coming up on Labor Day weekend, which closes out the summer and tends to be a popular occasion to drop prices. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/labor-day-sales-2025">Labor Day sales</a> have already gone live at most major retailers, with deals worth checking out on everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/target-lego-deals-labor-day-sale-2025">LEGO sets</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-gaming-pc-labor-day-sale-2025">gaming PCs</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the first thing I’m looking for in any of these sales is discounts on physical games. Surprisingly enough, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-labor-day-sale-2025">Amazon's Labor Day sale</a> has listed first-time discounts on some of the latest and greatest PS5 games, while the PlayStation Store has launched its own sale on digital editions. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon Drops Prices on the Latest PS5 Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The physical games I’ve listed above are all at or close to their lowest-ever prices. The discounts aren’t mind-blowing, I know, but they are the first price drops we’ve seen on recent releases like Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 and College Football 26, both of which just came out in July. The Tony Hawk remake has been especially popular here at IGN, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review">Luke Reilly’s review</a> saying it "proves yet again the series’ over-the-top skateboarding formula is totally timeless." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another personal recommendation is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">Split Fiction</a>, the latest two-person adventure from It Takes Two developer Hazelight Studios. This discount is made all the better by the fact that the co-op game only requires one person to buy it, while the other can download the game through Friend’s Pass. You could go 50/50 with a friend and grab the GOTY contender for $20 each. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Split Fiction - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">SEGA is generally going hard on the discounts right now, with an ongoing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/SEGAPublisherSale2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publisher sale on Steam</a> and price cuts on those games at pretty much every retailer. Last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> is the highlight I've included here, but you can also find discounts on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">Persona games</a> as well as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-games-in-order">Yakuza series</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Playstation’s Ready, Set, Play! Sale: Up to 75% Off Digital Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While not branded as having anything to do with Labor Day, the Playstation Store has launched its Ready, Set, Play! sale at the same time as the holiday weekend. The promotion mainly applies to digital games and features separate discounts from what you’ll find on physical games at retailers like Amazon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You won’t find as many discounts on new releases (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-2025">PlayStation Plus</a> is the way to go for those), but the deals you will find are pretty massive. I’d take it as a good opportunity to do some homework before the big sequels we have coming up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A bundle of the two most recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-games-in-order">Resident Evil games</a> (outside of remakes) has dropped to just $19.99, giving you a solid gateway to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, while The Witcher 3 drops below $8 as we get ready for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv">The Witcher 4</a>. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">What About PS5 Console Deals? </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, I haven’t seen any discounts on PS5 consoles, which isn’t too surprising in light of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-5-price-rises-for-us">recent price hikes</a>. If you're desperate for the console, I highly recommend checking out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/certified-refurbished-ps5-deals-at-playstation">PlayStation's Certified Refurbished options</a>. Otherwise, here's to hoping we miraculously see some deals around Black Friday. <br>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">In the deep of the night.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring: Nightreign's previously-rumored ultra-hard difficulty mode is real and official, according to Bandai Namco, and it's coming to the game on September 11.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-high-difficulty-expedition-mode-deep-of-night-has-appeared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As announced in an official post</a>, the new mode is called "Deep of Night" and is essentially a challenge mode of the base game. While previously, Nightreign's ongoing challenging endgame content has been limited to more difficult bosses, Deep of Night will impact an entire run, from start to finish.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For one, enemies will just be stronger than normal across the board. You also won't get a heads up about which Nightlord you'll be fighting, nor will you know if you're getting a Shifting Earth event in advance, so you won't be able to prep a build for any specific type of run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, to counterbalance this, players will be able to collect new types of weapons and relics with even more powerful effects...though they may also have some new drawbacks attached as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you play and win Deep of Night you will descend to deeper depth levels, going at least as far as Depth 5. Each new Depth gets even more challenging, though losses will push you back up to easier Depths.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-dataminers-say-theyve-uncovered-an-entirely-new-ultra-hard-game-mode">This mode was previously datamined</a>, with dataminers getting all the announced details correct. Not announced but suggested by the datamine is that Deep of Night will feature skill-based matchmaking, and that some enemies will get special additional effects, such as being "magmafied," or covered in magma. The datamine also suggests that players can unlock access to three additional relic slots for Deep of Night only, giving them up to a total of six.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign a 7/10</a>, saying "when Elden Ring Nightreign is played exactly as it was designed to be played, it’s one of the finest examples of a three-player co-op game around – but that's harder to do than it should be, and playing solo is poorly balanced." The game recently got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-finally-gets-duos-mode-with-patch-102-game-balance-adjusts-to-the-current-number-of-players">a much-requested duos mode</a>, and currently has two Everdark Sovereign bosses available for players wanting a challenge before Deep of Night: Libra, and Caligo.
