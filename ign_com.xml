            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/snowbreak-containment-zone-update-adds-new-events-and-gameplay-enhancements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The free-to-play 3D waifu sci-fi RPG shooter Snowbreak: Containment Zone just dropped its latest update, and it adds lots of new content. There are new characters, skins, gameplay modes, and even more on the horizon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not familiar with Snowbreak, it’s a third-person RPG shooter on PC and mobile that takes place in a world where giant beings known as Titans suddenly appear in heavily populated areas. They cause untold destruction and leave a toxic substance known as Titagen in their wake. Leaders joined together to form the Heimdall Force, a paramilitary unit whose mission is to fight back against these Titans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as the Adjutant of the Heimdall Force, and your job is to recruit and lead a squad of female super soldiers. Known as Manifestations, these soldiers awakened to their powers after the first arrival of the Titans, and the strongest among them are even able to use Titagen in combat without the ill effects normally associated with it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/fight-1744401193210.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The story is told in chapters, with each chapter further broken down into stages. In each combat stage, you form a squad of three characters, each of whom have their own unique skills. You only control one character on the battlefield at a time, and using their skills drains energy, which slowly refills over time. So you need to strategically swap between each of your characters to make the best use of their abilities without fully draining their energy. As you progress, you can build relationships with members of your squad by giving them gifts or deploying them in combat. As their affinity for you grows, you’ll get to know them better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest update adds a new story scenario called Abyssal Dawn, which will have you investigating an incident with the two characters who are also new additions in the update: Nerida and Nita - Pulse.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/nerida-1744401232522.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nerida is self-demanding, often solitary, and can be stern with others but not to you. She likes sweet snacks, plushies, and ancient marine life models, and she’s obsessed with deep-sea documentaries and jellyfish care. She’s equipped with a Chaos-type assault rifle, and her role is the primary damage dealer of your squad. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">She excels with both single-target and area-of-effect attacks and can build up the Internal Injury effect on enemies with both her Standard Skill and Ultimate, which summons a jellyfish that provides AoE damage buffs and stays on the field even if you switch to another character. You can then switch back to her to use her Standard Skill, which deals big burst damage by consuming the Internal Injury effect you’ve built up.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/nita-pulse-1744401268347.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nita - Pulse is casual yet perceptive, driven by money but protective of the vulnerable. While she’s on the battlefield, she keeps her eyes peeled for items of value and likes to pocket them, like Titagen objects. She wields a Thermal-type shotgun and brings a new QTE combat mechanic with her. Successfully chain QTE inputs together during her Standard Skill to deal increased damage, and if you fully complete the chain, she unleashes a final powerful strike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nita - Pulse is free to acquire for all players, available now by completing the Pulse Puzzles event. She’ll also be available for free as a login reward during the Nita’s Invitation event that starts May 1. If you participate in that event, you’ll also be able to earn Nita’s fully modified exclusive weapon, maxed Auctus Drive (her version of a Manifestation), and signature fixed-talent Logistics squad. So in one event, you can max out her full build at no cost.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/nitas-invitation-event-1744401305118.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re wondering what the Pulse Puzzles event is, that’s another new addition with the latest update. As the name implies, it’ll have you solve puzzles across various parts of the game. It’s a chance to relax and better understand Nita, and it will be permanently available, so you can do it at your own pace. To get to know Nita even more, there’s also a new interactable scene with her called Grove of Secrets that’s available from now until May 29.<br>
</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/nita-sylvan-spirit-1744401345665.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nita - Pulse and Nerida were both introduced alongside additional skins. Nita’s transforms her into a white-haired forest nymph, and Nerida’s features interchangeable parts, including footwear and stockings, similar to the customization options available for Vidya. But they’re not the only ones getting new looks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The update added new outfits for Katya, Fenny, and Bubu. Katya was introduced a year ago and is known for her unique appearance and characteristics. Fenny has been in the game since launch and become a fan favorite, and Bubu is a character from last year’s traditional-themed event.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/katya-1744401375399.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a new hide-and-seek gameplay mode called Let’s Go, Heimdall! for 15 players at a time, where three seekers try to find 12 hiders. On the horizon is the much-anticipated Emotional Purge mode, which adds cover-based shooting gameplay. It’ll first be available on April 28 and will be further refined in future updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in addition to her new costume, Bubu is also getting a new dorm room at your home base. That also adds new interactable furniture in the form of her Tranquil Desk Set.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/tranquil-desk-set-1744401487995.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Those are the highlights of this update, but there’s even more that’s been added. You’ll just have to play it to see it all. Snowbreak: Containment Zone is available to download for free right now on Steam, iOS, and Android, and it’s cross-platform, so your progress is shared across all platforms.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-fans-are-worried-tears-of-the-kingdoms-switch-2-version-wont-support-cloud-saves<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The cloud situation is a bit foggy.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 is set to get special enhanced versions of several Switch 1 games, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. A newly spotted disclaimer has fans worrying some games, or at least one game, won't support Nintendo's cloud save functionality as they'd hope.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the last day or so, users have been noticing that Nintendo's pages for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787249.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s Switch 2 edition carries the following disclaimer: "Please note: this software does not support the Nintendo Switch Online paid membership’s Save Data Cloud backup feature."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-switch-2-editions-of-the-legend-of-zelda-botw-totk-do-not-support-cloud-saves-saves-can-still-be-transferred-however.1166340/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>, the page for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787250.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Switch 2 Edition</a> also apparently carried this disclaimer at one point, as did <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Super-Mario-Party-Jamboree-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Jamboree-TV-2785806.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though it's since disappeared from those pages, the Tears of the Kingdom still has the disclaimer as of this writing. The Japanese page though, per <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-edition-zelda-games-wont-support-cloud-saves-to-backup-your-data" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> via machine translation, does not carry the same disclaimer; only the US and EU pages seem to be showing it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has reached out to Nintendo for clarification on the matter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If this holds true, this could create some confusing scenarios for players. Nintendo's cloud save option for NSO members is handy, for one. It makes carrying games across systems, or juggling storage space for games without losing your saved progress, a little less stres-inducing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Actually importing a save file from the original Switch to the Switch 2 Edition of Tears of the Kingdom does seem to still work. The Nintendo page noted an additional save slot for the Switch 2 Edition, where one can start a brand-new journey or "continue a previous one with your existing save data." Nintendo does note that save data created in the second save data slot cannot be trasnferred to the Nintendo Switch 1 version of Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a confusing situation that can possibly lead to some stress, as players would likely not want to lose a save file they've dumped many, many hours into when upgrading versions. Hopefully, this gets cleared up soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 Edition does have a few reasons for prospective Switch 2 owners to upgrade, including the Zelda Notes app, which comes packed with helpful guiding content, lore, and even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-zelda-ports-will-let-players-repair-equipment-with-the-zelda-notes-app-if-theyre-lucky">some potential equipment repair options</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
