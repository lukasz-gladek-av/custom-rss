That’s a staggering 122% markup, and with demand still outpacing supply, even Amazon has hiked its prices well above retail.</p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="218089"><div id="218089" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The availability is still good, as you’re not fighting bots or hoping your local store remembered to stock anything. This is probably your best shot today that doesn’t involve rolling the dice with potential scams through third-party sellers. Still, if you do decide to buy, do it with a fair warning that this is a heavily increased price. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">My Favorite Prismatic Evolutions Single Cards</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review">Prismatic Evolutions</a> is stacked. This is an Eeveelution collector’s dream (and a wallet’s nightmare). The Special Illustration Rare cards in this set are already climbing to jaw-dropping prices on resale sites.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The single card market, however, is a different story. Prices are slowly coming down, with Dragapult ex coming right down from over $100 to around $45 alongside Roaring Moon ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umbreon ex (161/131) is the crown jewel, going for a laughable $1,298 in lightly played condition. It’s absurd, but it’s exactly the kind of pull that justifies ripping packs like a gremlin. Sylveon ex (156/131) isn’t far behind, selling around $450 depending on condition, and Espeon ex (155/131) continues the psychic-type price madness with listings near $300. Some sellers are offering copies in the $90 range, but blink and those are gone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jolteon ex (153/131) brings the lightning with prices hovering around $265 for near mint, although listings under $100 do pop up — briefly. And then there's the rest of the Eevee family: Vaporeon, Flareon, Glaceon, and Leafeon ex are all pulling serious numbers, with some copies going well over $250, and even the “low” end listings still sitting in the $75–$100 range.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it’s not just about the Eeveelutions. Pikachu ex (179/131) might be one of the few heavy hitters in this set that’s still hovering under $100, currently around $70, but Pikachu is never a bad pull recently. Roaring Moon ex and Dragapult ex round out the list of top chase cards. Both are popular picks, with prices ranging from $45 to $200 depending on the condition and the whims of the secondary market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
