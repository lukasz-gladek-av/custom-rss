Normally this game is listed for $49.99, but it's currently down to $39.99 so you can save $10 on it. Keep in mind though that this version is probably not the North American version with ESRB rating, but it’ll play just fine on your Switch since the plarform is region-free.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Sonic X Shadow Generations for $39.99</h2><div catalogid="50677685-e540-462f-bcb7-e55f4c2d88b4" id="209687"><div id="209687" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic X Shadow Generations - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This title comes with a remaster of Sonic Generations and a new campaign for Shadow.

It's a game that "hopefully will be the gold standard Sega holds itself to when it decides to bring back other Sonic games from the past."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for even more Nintendo Switch games on sale, you're in luck.
