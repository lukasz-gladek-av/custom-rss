Some of my favorite games are included here, most notably <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXveP?object_uuid=1400d27b-fb11-40fe-886d-013dcab0ab3b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legends: Arceus</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m currently playing through it again to calm my hype for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Legends: Z-A</a> when it drops for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide">Switch 2</a>. In my opinion, Legends: Arceus still holds up incredibly well, especially when you lean into the exploration and catching mechanics that set it apart from the usual formula.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Mainline Pokémon Game Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Performance updates for older games like these are possible once Switch 2 releases, although nothing is guaranteed yet. Some games might require specific patches or paid upgrades to fully take advantage of the new hardware. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, based on how Nintendo has handled generational shifts in the past, it is likely that most titles will at least see smoother frame rates, better resolutions, and stronger stability even without official patches. In my opinion, it is a smart time to grab a few favorites while they are discounted.</p><p id="pokmon-legends-arceus"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Legends: Arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</h2></p><div catalogid="252c07cb-0977-4973-b680-164f7818c39e" id="219594"><div id="219594" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-arceus-review">Legends: Arceus</a> threw out the traditional gym system and gave us something a lot more interesting: open-world (kind of) exploration and real-time catching mechanics. You're not just battling wild Pokémon, you're sneaking up on them, throwing Poké Balls by hand, and dodging attacks yourself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is a refreshing change of pace, and it still feels ahead of its time compared to some other entries. If you are like me and counting down the days until Legends: Z-A on Switch 2, playing Arceus again is honestly the best way to pass the time.</p></div><p id="pokmon-sword"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Sword">Pokémon Sword</h2></p><div catalogid="252c07cb-0977-4973-b680-164f7818c39e" id="219595"><div id="219595" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Sword</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sword was one half of Pokémon's first fully 3D mainline entries on Switch (Yes, we know it was Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee, but this is the first fully-ledged new generation game).<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/13/pokemon-sword-and-shield-review"> Sword and Shield</a> introduces the Galar region, Dynamax battles, and the Wild Area. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latter is a semi-open world filled with high-level monsters and weather changes. Sword-specific content includes exclusive Pokémon like Zacian (the sword-wielding legendary) and gym leaders like Bea. In my opinion, Sword leans a little more into offense-focused exclusives, making it a solid choice if you like fast, aggressive teams.</p></div><p id="pokmon-shield"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Shield">Pokémon Shield</h2></p><div catalogid="252c07cb-0977-4973-b680-164f7818c39e" id="219596"><div id="219596" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Shield</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Shield is the companion to Sword, but it is not just a reskin. You get different gym leaders like Allister, exclusive Pokémon like Zamazenta (who basically turns into a shield), and a slightly different emphasis on defensive strategies. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also think Shield players tend to get access to a few more bulkier, tankier monsters earlier on. Otherwise, it is the same story and exploration structure. Choosing between Sword and Shield is really just about what kind of team you want to build.</p></div><p id="pokmon-brilliant-diamond"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Brilliant Diamond">Pokémon Brilliant Diamond</h2></p><div catalogid="252c07cb-0977-4973-b680-164f7818c39e" id="219597"><div id="219597" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-brilliant-diamond-shining-pearl-review">Brilliant Diamond</a> is a modern remake of the 2006 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-ds-games">Nintendo DS</a> game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-diamond-version">Pokémon Diamond</a>. It sticks very closely to the original's map layout and story beats but gives everything a 3D polish with the “chibi” art style. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Grand Underground is the real upgrade here, offering a massive labyrinth of caves where you can find rare Pokémon and new biomes. Brilliant Diamond's exclusive Pokémon include Dialga, Cranidos, and Honchkrow, so if you are a fan of those, this is the version you want.</p></div><p id="pokmon-shining-pearl"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Shining Pearl ">Pokémon Shining Pearl </h2></p><div catalogid="252c07cb-0977-4973-b680-164f7818c39e" id="219598"><div id="219598" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Shining Pearl </h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Shining Pearl is the sister version to Brilliant Diamond, also remaking the original DS adventure with the same faithful approach. The main difference comes down to which Pokémon you can catch. Palkia, Shieldon, and Mismagius headline the version exclusives here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, Shining Pearl tends to get overlooked compared to Diamond, but it is every bit as good, especially if you want a slightly different roster of monsters without changing the core experience.
</p></div><p id="pokmon-lets-go-eevee"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!">Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!</h2></p><div catalogid="252c07cb-0977-4973-b680-164f7818c39e" id="219600"><div id="219600" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/12/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-and-eevee-review">Let’s Go, Eevee!</a> is a reimagining of Pokémon Yellow, simplified and streamlined for newcomers but still charming for longtime fans. It uses Pokémon GO-style motion controls for catching wild Pokémon, and instead of random encounters, you see everything in the overworld. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eevee becomes your starter here, and it can learn unique moves like Bouncy Bubble and Sizzly Slide that are not available anywhere else. If you want a more relaxed, almost cozy Pokémon experience, this is it.</p></div><p id="pokmon-lets-go-pikachu"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!">Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!</h2></p><div catalogid="252c07cb-0977-4973-b680-164f7818c39e" id="219599"><div id="219599" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s Go, Pikachu! is the twin to Let’s Go, Eevee! but obviously, you are starting with Pikachu instead. Gameplay is identical, but Pikachu gets its own special moves, like Zippy Zap and Splishy Splash, that are ridiculously OP. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are a lifelong Pikachu fan or just want the classic mascot front and center, this version makes more sense. Otherwise, it really comes down to which starter you want riding around on your shoulder the whole game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
