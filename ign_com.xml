Operation: Infinite’s free, 100-tier Operation Pass and 100-tier Premium Pass have no planned expiration date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the new Halo games Halo Studios is working on is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, which is due out at some point in 2026 across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 5. Halo Studios did not say what the other upcoming Halo games are.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Halo Games in Chronological Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“As we look back on four years of evolution and updates in Halo Infinite, we’d like to thank our community for your steadfast support,” Halo Studios said. “Without your feedback and enthusiasm, Halo Infinite multiplayer would not be the special place it is today: a robust arena for slaying and playing, with something for every Spartan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With multiple Halo titles in development, we’ll need our whole team's combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us. While we remain committed to supporting Halo Infinite on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo Studios, once called 343 Industries, leaves Halo Infinite behind four years after its delayed launch across Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, and PC in December 2021. Microsoft had intended for it to be an Xbox Series X and S launch title and come out a year earlier, but pushed it back following negative feedback to a hotly anticipated gameplay reveal in July 2020.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo Infinite went through significant changes in the years following its release, including the rebranding of its developer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-halo-games-moving-to-unreal-engine-as-developer-343-industries-officially-changes-its-name"><u>343 Industries, to Halo Studios</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-hit-by-layoffs-on-anniversary-of-activision-blizzard-announcement">multiple rounds of layoffs</a>. This came after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-infinite-steam-player-count-doubles-following-season-5-launch"><u>player numbers for Halo Infinite dropped off dramatically after launch</u></a> as fans expressed frustration over a lack of content, poor progression systems, and aggressive monetization. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-infinite-battle-royale-was-real-and-could-have-been-a-game-changer-dev-says"><u>A "game changer" battle royale mode was scrapped</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gamers are already pointing out that Halo Infinite hasn’t even managed to reach the halfway point of Microsoft’s well-documented 10-year plan for the game (it wasn’t called Halo: Infinite for nothing). In July 2020, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-infinite-2-wont-be-happening-says-343-industries">IGN spoke with now former Halo Infinite Studio Head Chris Lee</a>, who described Halo Infinite as “the start of our platform for the future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want Infinite to grow over time, versus going to those numbered titles and having all that segmentation that we had before,” he continued. “It’s really about creating Halo Infinite as the start of the next 10 years for Halo and then building that as we go with our fans and community.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While continued updates have significantly improved the experience, Halo Infinite never quite managed to realize its potential. The focus now is on Halo: Campaign Evolved, although this, too, has suffered a bumpy ride since it was announced, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-made-it-right-and-they-are-breaking-it-for-no-reason-one-of-the-key-members-of-the-original-halo-dev-team-doesnt-sound-thrilled-with-microsofts-halo-campaign-evolved">one of the key members of the original Halo development team at Bungie expressing concern about some of the changes made</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
