If you've had your eye on it, now is a great time to add it to your virtual shopping cart. It's one we certainly think is worth the investment, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound (PS5) for $31.12</h2><div catalogid="cf9d7410-97e2-4565-b4a8-4b1fdd202b22" id="234359"><div id="234359" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound - Playstation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Writer Will Borger had very high praise for Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound in his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review">review</a>. He explains that it, "looks and sounds incredible, and the fast but thoughtful combat is so damn satisfying that I had a hard time putting it down long enough to write this review." He even exclaims that, "Ninja Gaiden fans, we were lost in the desert for a long time, but Ragebound is like running across an oasis; trust me when I tell you we’ve never been so back."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not the only praise this game received, either. Ragebound even secured a runner-up spot in our nominees list for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-action-game-of-2025">best action game of 2025</a>, thanks to how it "reimagines and modernizes the classic stylings of old-school, 2D Ninja Gaiden with a unique hypercharge mechanic that encourages you to think not just about the order in which you dispatch your enemies, but the tool they use as well." If that's sold you on it, it's worth noting that the game above also sets you up with the soundtrack and a booklet, which is a fun bonus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game deals don't end there, though. We've found a couple more 2025 releases that have received some nice discounts over at Amazon, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-for-ps5-is-back-to-its-lowest-price-yet-at-amazon">Assassin’s Creed Shadows for PS5</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-gets-a-7-discount-at-both-amazon-and-walmart">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. Walmart's also offering some nice deals at the moment, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-dropped-to-just-40-in-the-new-year-sales">Battlefield 6 among them and marked down to $40</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 12, 2026 3:20 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-ps5-hits-a-new-low-price-at-amazon]]></content:encoded>
