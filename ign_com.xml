And alongside arriving in the Switch 2 launch window, Agent 47 will also be donning some new, appropriately Nintendo-themed duds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On <a href="https://ioi.dk/?panel=hitman%2Fnews%2F2025%2Fsignature-edition-launching-on-nintendo-switch-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IO Interactive's site</a>, the developer confirmed Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition will go up for pre-order soon, for both digital and physical editions. A pre-order of the digital edition will get you the Signature Pack, which includes two red-and-white outfits for Agent 47, a golden wrench, and a mushroom. Mushroom effects unknown at this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Physical pre-orders, meanwhile, offer both the Signature Pack and the Quack Pack, which offers a Luigi-themed green-and-grey suit and a green rubber duck. Much like a bald guy in a red tie and suit at a Paris fashion show, nothing unusual to see here.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/02/unnamed-1-1743612341462.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/02/unnamed-1743612341462.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Less-than-subtle references aside, it's fun to see Agent 47 get some Nintendo attire. Other games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/31/heres-how-the-bayonettanintendo-costumes-were-designed">Bayonetta</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/12/e3-2017-skyrim-for-switch-includes-zelda-items-amiibo-compatibility">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a> got their own Nintendo crossover cosmetics, and Agent 47 certainly has earned a bit of Nintendo theming of his own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The World of Assassination spans a trilogy of games, as Agent 47 undertakes a number of missions to assassinate targets and complete contracts for his clientele. Starting with 2016's Hitman, the WoA trilogy runs up through Hitman III, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-3-review">IGN gave a 9</a>, saying: "Rich, rewarding, and highly replayable, Hitman 3 is one of the barcoded butcher's best appearances."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition combines all of it together into one package. This includes the main campaign, contracts mode, escalations, Elusive Target arcades, and featured live content for Hitman, Hitman 2, and Hitman 3. Also included is the Freelancer game mode, a roguelike option for those who want even more variety and options in their Hitman experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition is due to arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in June 2025. Its also available now on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, the original Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation PS VR2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
