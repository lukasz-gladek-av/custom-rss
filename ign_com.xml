            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The long-leaked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> battle royale experience will seemingly shadow-drop across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S soon, with a full gameplay reveal for Battlefield REDSEC now set to premiere tomorrow morning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios (finally) confirmed plans to pull back the curtain on its new free-to-play Battlefield mode <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1982824837849760155" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via social media</a> today. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn8k1g3vMDU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Battlefield REDSEC official gameplay trailer</a> is now scheduled for premiere at 8 a.m. PT / 11 a.m. ET tomorrow, October 28, with its description teasing a surprise launch. The news follows months of rumors and leaks, suggesting that Battlefield 6 battle royale was nearly here.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Battlefield (@Battlefield) <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1982824837849760155?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Those who have enjoyed Battlefield 6 since it first landed for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 10 expected to hear news of a proper, complimentary battle royale experience when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-trailer-highlights-blackwell-fields-and-eastwood-maps-ahead-of-next-weeks-launch"><u>Season 1 was properly unveiled last week</u></a>. As first details of EA and BF Studios’ latest came and went, however, there was no sign of what many had expected to be a substantial new game mode to drop into.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was strange, especially as hints of a Battlefield 6 battle royale game mode <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-battlefield-leak-reveals-extremely-brief-look-at-the-start-of-a-battle-royale-match-as-ea-issues-takedowns"><u>began to leak as early as July 2025</u></a>. The popular, last-squad-standing experience is nothing new for the franchise and remains popular among shooter fans, so with Battlefield promising a return to its roots with destructible environments and gritty gameplay, another stab at battle royale felt like a no-brainer at the time. Community manager Kevin Johnson then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-is-getting-battle-royale-releases-chaotic-teaser-trailer"><u>confirmed BF Studios had indeed begun work on such a mode in August</u></a>, adding that only those involved in the Battlefield 6 closed test program, Battlefield Labs, would get to play at first.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Official updates have been quiet since, but that didn’t stop Labs testers from drumming up hype. Battlefield battle royale <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6s-battle-royale-footage-has-leaked-heres-what-it-shows-us"><u>gameplay snuck its way online in September</u></a>, confirming that things like swimming, combat, and destruction had been translated over to this new experience. Just as quickly as EA stamped out leaks, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-gameplay-highlights-multiplayer-combat-in-latest-bf-labs-leak"><u>more soon popped up on social media</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A battle royale game mode for Battlefield 6 Season 1 was all but confirmed, even as news of the first major content drop passed without confirmation from BF Studios. Things then really heated up last Friday, when <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1981741907387523203" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ModernWarzone</u></a> reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-official-name-and-release-date-reportedly-leak-online"><u>battle royale would shadow-drop alongside the first Battlefield 6 season with the title Battlefield REDSEC</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with so little in terms of official word from the developers, a Battlefield 6 battle royale shadow-drop seems all but confirmed for tomorrow morning. Labs leaks date back months ago, so there’s no telling what content made it into the Battlefield REDSEC launch build.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll know more about the new Battlefield 6 game mode when the trailer premieres in less than 24 hours. Until then, you can read about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-will-leak-everything-battlefield-6-devs-insist-they-didnt-want-the-game-to-suffer-from-leaks-but-getting-player-feedback-had-to-come-at-any-cost">how EA and BF Studios did their best to combat leakers – even if they knew it was an uphill battle</a>.

You can play solo or in a group of up to 6 people, but for each zombie you take down, you'll be closer to leveling up and gaining mastery of special weapons, perks, and more. Complete quests, roll spins for perks, and customize your character to be the ultimate zombie-slaying machine. So, whether you're jumping into specific maps like the school or sewer, taking on a raid, or completing campaign mode, here are codes for Hunty Zombie that will give you a boost when tackling the undead.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Working Hunty Zombie Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You need to be Level 5 before you can use codes. But once you've hit that level, here are the codes you can redeem:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Reaper</strong> - 15x Lucky Weapon Spin </li><li><strong>RIP67</strong> - 200,000 Coins</li><li><strong>ScytheRP</strong> - 10x Traits</li><li><strong>NEWBOSSRAID123</strong> - 15x Lucky Perk Spin</li><li><strong>HZ4EVER</strong> - 300,000 Coins</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Use Hunty Zombie Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">To redeem codes, launch the Hunty Zombie Roblox experience. When you're in the main lobby, follow these steps to get your goodies:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Locate the codes menu on the right side of the screen. It's the icon of the open book at the top of the submenus. </li><li>Copy the code from this article and then paste it into the bar that says "enter code here..."</li><li>Click confirm and receive your rewards!</li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">Expired Hunty ZombieCodes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">These codes are no longer valid:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Halloween</strong> -  300,000 Coins </li><li><strong>SpinalBlade</strong> - 10 Weapon Lucky Spins</li><li><strong>NewSwordHW</strong> - 10x Traits</li><li><strong>SIRJACKY</strong> - 10x Perk Lucky Spins</li><li><strong>SpookyPet</strong> - 150,000 Coin </li><li><strong>hwticket</strong> - 5x Halloween Tickets</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Isn't My Hunty Zombie Code Working?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Codes for Roblox experiences are usually case-sensitive, so the best way to ensure you've got a working code is to directly copy it from this article. We check all codes before we upload them, so you can guarantee they're working. Just double-check that you haven't copied over an extra space!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When Is the Next Hunty Zombie Update?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Hunty Zombie's neweest update launched on Friday, 24th October. A new Grim Repear raid was introduced, along with new weapons that you can get via the Grim Repear raid shop, a new pet that only has a 2% chance of dropping from the boss, and plenty of balance changes and bug fixes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lauren Harper is an Associate Guides Editor.
