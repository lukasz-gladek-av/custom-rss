            <guid>1420714</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve seen Crimson Desert’s impressive 15-minute gameplay video, you might be wincing at the thought of it running smoothly on your console or PC. Well, right now, the developers at Pearl Abyss are focusing on optimization to help ensure a “smooth” experience when the game comes out in March.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crimson Desert is set in a huge and seamless open world packed with enemies, NPCs, and all sorts of things to do. It’s dense with detail, and you can zip around quickly on the back of a dragon. Based on the video, below, Crimson Desert will be a demanding beast — it will be interesting in particular to see how it runs on the Xbox Series S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Will Powers, director of public relations at Pearl Abyss America, the developers are doubling down on the "optimization phase” as we speak, telling former IGN video extraordinaire Destin Legarie in <a href="https://youtu.be/5hPXEVG-X5g?si=4A95xvuCARBCLl1f" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new interview</a> that this is the focus ahead of Crimson Desert’s March 19 release date.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have gone gold. Now comes further, further optimization to make the game run as good as it possibly can,” Powers said. “And that’s as important of a part. So that's the phase we're currently in between now and launch to make sure that the experience when players eventually get their hands on the game, is as smooth as possible.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Powers wouldn’t go into specifics on the graphics settings that will be available on consoles, but did confirm Crimson Desert has PS5 Pro enhancement. You can also turn off the particle effects in settings, although Powers said they do convey important information during fights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pearl Abyss built a new engine for Crimson Desert, and Powers explained that it’s capable of providing a 4K60 native presentation, complete with ray tracing, without the aid of graphics technology such as DLSS or FSR. But of course you’ll need powerful hardware to enable it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, we'll show 4K 60 native, sure, with ray tracing on, that's not done through DLSS or FSR, that's done natively in-engine,” Powers said. “And then if you want to further optimize then you can tweak all the settings and do all the things, but we want to show that you don't have to… like the game itself should be able to stand on its own.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Crimson Desert Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And on that decision to go with a proprietary engine:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not going to say that the game is absolutely perfectly optimized, but within the engine it's using every single thing. So it's as optimized as it can be within that space. That's not possible otherwise. And so rendering thousands of trees within draw distance, it does those things better than an off-the-shelf engine could because of that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Off-the-shelf engines weren't able to deliver the uncompromised vision that the developers set forth to create with this game. So, they needed to create their own engine in order to deliver on that vision.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crimson Desert’s huge open world has been a topic of debate recently. Pywel is divided into five distinct regions: Hernand; Pailune; Demeniss; Delesyia; and the Crimson Desert itself. The main quest revolves around protagonist Kliff’s journey, but you’re free to explore the world in any order, taking faction-driven quests, large-scale battles, fortress sieges and smaller, character-focused missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pearl Abyss confirmed that as the story progresses, two additional playable characters become available, each with unique combat styles, skills and weapons. Exploration is a big part of the game — you travel on horseback, climb terrain, glide across distances, and later access advanced traversal options such as a missile-firing mech and a dragon. Pearl Abyss said the world is filled with hidden treasures, ancient mechanisms, puzzles and points of interest “designed to reward curiosity and discovery.” As for combat, expect to face enemy soldiers, sorcerers, beasts and machines.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-deserts-open-world-is-at-least-twice-as-big-as-skyrims-and-larger-than-the-red-dead-redemption-2-map"><u>Powers called Crimson Desert’s open world “absolutely massive,”</u></a> bigger even than that of Bethesda’s Skyrim and Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on <a href="https://youtu.be/aEX6hjTSlOk?si=Ei_PQfEUiBEH5A6F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the Gaming Interviews YouTube channel</u></a>, Powers said that describing the size of Crimson Desert’s world in terms of numbers doesn’t do it justice, because doing so fails to capture the scope and scale of the game. But he did go as far as to compare it to two of the biggest open-world games around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think numbers really do it justice because, how big is that in terms of scope and scale?” he said. “But what we can say is that the world's at least twice as big as the open world, the playable area, of Skyrim. It's larger than the map of Red Dead Redemption 2."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Powers went on to insist that the size of Crimson Desert’s open world wouldn't determine its quality. Rather, what you actually do in it is the key factor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The continent of Pywel is absolutely massive, but size doesn't really matter if there's nothing to do,” he said. “Open-world games are about doing things, having activities, having distractions. So we wanted to create a world that's not only massive, but is also incredibly interactive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Pearl Abyss.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[NCR Power Armor From the Fallout TV Show Makes Its Way Into Fallout 76 — but You'll Need to Spend $30 to Use It]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/ncr-power-armor-from-the-fallout-tv-show-makes-its-way-into-fallout-76-but-youll-need-to-spend-30-to-use-it</link>
            <guid>1420708</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Inevitably, the New California Republic Power Armor that made such a dramatic appearance in the latest episode of the Fallout TV show is now in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>. But rather than sell it via the in-game shop and thus allow players to buy it with Atoms, Fallout 76’s virtual currency, it is only available as part of a standalone DLC bundle priced $30.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In lieu of a brand new Fallout video game, Bethesda has leaned heavily on Fallout 76 to capitalize on boosted interest in all things Fallout following the breakout success of the Prime Video TV show. Fallout 76 has Walton Goggins’ character The Ghoul dishing out quests, for example. There is a New Vegas-style expansion (Season 2 is set in New Vegas — or what’s left of it). And now Fallout 76 has the NCR Power Armor that Maximus uses to fight a pack of Deathclaws in Episode 7.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Never underestimate the power of brand recognition. <a href="https://t.co/vuHbfcQ6EB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/vuHbfcQ6EB</a></p>— FALLOUT⚡️ (@falloutonprime) <a href="https://twitter.com/falloutonprime/status/2016573413502906575?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 28, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That NCR Power Armor is a big talking point among Fallout fans for a number of reasons. It’s brand new — we’ve not seen its type in the video games before — and it sparks all sorts of questions about the Fallout lore and what we thought the NCR was capable of. Setting aside the fact that an NCR Power Armor appearance in Fallout 76, which is set <em>before</em> all the other Fallout video games, makes little sense lore wise because the NCR didn’t exist yet, its price has become the big talking point.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The NCR Power Armor is available in Fallout 76 via the Mojave Bundle, which includes the following:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Ranger Power Armor Paint</li><li>NCR Flag</li><li>New Vegas Neon Sign</li><li>Ad Victoriam (Super Sledge)</li><li>Legion Legate Outfit</li><li>Player Title Prefix – “Advictoriam”</li><li>Player Title Prefix &amp; Suffix – “Tribune”</li></ul><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/f76-1769766158551.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Fallout 76 Mojave Bundle costs $30. Image credit: Bethesda.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The long and the short of it is that if you want the NCR Power Armor, you need to hand over $30 for this entire bundle — a standard practice these days really, where DLC bundles often cost more than entire video games, and items you might not necessarily want are thrown in to improve “value.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans have said the bundle is overpriced at $30, and accused Bethesda of “cashing in” on the show by not making it available to buy for Atoms, which most players will have stashed away for DLC like this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, the price of the Mojave bundle is ridiculous,” one fan said. “It’s exhausting to watch a studio that once had credibility reduce everything to cash grabs. I guess a lot of people will pay for it anyway. Good luck.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a sentiment shared by many across the various Fallout subreddits, Steam’s own forum, and social media. “Yeah this is a hard pass for me. Put it in the Atom shop,” said a disgruntled fan. “£26.99 for eight items, two of which are just words!!!” added another. “Then you've got two C.A.M.P items, a Power Armor paint, a weapon, plus an outfit with a helmet.... Not even a cheeky few hundred Atoms thrown in! That's actually peak lmao, but whilst people keep buying it, Bethesda are going to keep selling it!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This DLC includes a set of armor that I'm never going to wear because the Legate armor doesn't fit in thematically with anything, it also includes a flag and a neon sign, none of which are of particular value to me,” reads one negative Steam review. “And with the Burning Sands starter bundle you at least get a free bullet machine. This bundle gives you nothing of value. For me the only reason to pick this up is the NCR Power Armor, which I can understand cashing in on the show, but they clearly didn't want to put it on the Atom shop for the people who have saved atoms. I would have paid $10 for this item no problem.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2, Episode 2 Video Game Details - Characters, Locations and Factions</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, not all players agree. Many are pointing to the $30 price point being standard for bundles of this type in Fallout 76 (and in other games), and others are saying you can simply choose not to but it if you don’t like it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Is it overpriced? Yes. Is it undervalued? Yes,” countered one fan. “It's still not predatory, because you can simply NOT BUY IT. You lose out on zero actual gameplay by not buying it. You also don't gain any gameplay from buying it. If having this bundle gave me some type of advantage in-game, that might be predatory, but this is just another bundle. I've skipped plenty of those over the years. This bundle replaced the Atomic Angler bundle, which I believe was also $30. There's ALWAYS going to be a cash bundle out there. Just don't buy it. It's that simple.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You know as weird as it is I just don't mind,” said another. “There's no gameplay content or quests / locations locked behind the purchase, so far every expansion has been released for free, there's plenty to do in the game and loads of other cosmetics and camp stuff to get for free or buy with atoms from challenges, the game (imo) doles out tons of Atoms anyway, and from my understanding these bundles typically go on more than 50% off sale pretty regularly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I mean like, whatever, you don't need to day one buy every single piece of content, if Bethesda releasing these lil whale drops occasionally means the vast majority of the game can stay free for the vast majority of players that's a good thing. Just be glad we're not a gacha or a lootbox game or something with actual predatory pricing.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda will of course be hoping that as many fans as possible decide that $30 is a reasonable price to pay to patrol the desert of Burning Springs like you’re straight out of the Fallout TV show. Data shows that the show has fueled an increase in player numbers for all Fallout games, with some newcomers dipping into the likes of Fallout 76 for the first time. I imagine in that context, this NCR Power Armor will prove quite popular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout 76 itself, meanwhile, is free-to-play until February 5, with the Season 2 finale set to broadcast on February 3. If you need to catch up, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-is-releasing-all-episodes-of-fallout-season-1-for-free-on-youtube-ahead-of-season-2-finale">Amazon has released Season 1 for free on YouTube</a>.
