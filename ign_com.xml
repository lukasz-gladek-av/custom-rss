"We have multiple game titles in the development pipeline. FromSoftware is currently developing Elden Ring Nightreign DLC (planned for release in FY2025) Elden Ring Tarnished Edition (planned for release in 2026 for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Nintendo Switch 2</u></a>), and The Duskbloods (planned for release in 2026)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FY2025 in this instance means by the end of Kadokawa's current financial year, so by March 31, 2026. But while the financial report revealed that Nightreign had "performed well beyond initial expectations" and confirmed the DLC — described on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3515610/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN__Deluxe_Upgrade_Pack/#app_reviews_hash" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam storefront</u></a> as being available "by Q4 2025" — is still on the way, recent user reviews for the Deluxe Upgrade Pack have dropped to a 'Mostly Negative' rating as players express their frustration at the lack of tangible news.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're mid-Q4 2025. No news, no teasers, total silence," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/CAXX/recommended/3515610/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a> one negative reviewer on November 1. "If you're thinking about buying Deluxe Upgrade, wait until we get actual news about the content. I can't recommend you a promise." Another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Raventg/recommended/3515610/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>: "It's been half a year now, still no dlc or any new characters in sight even though they got leaked a bit ago. Right now this is a complete scam, as even the soundtrack isnt even full."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Someone else <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/katarinabluu/recommended/3515610/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a> they would change their negative review to positive "once FromSoft announces something."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightreign's ultra-hard difficulty mode, Deep of Night, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-has-an-update-and-one-last-tease-for-us-before-elden-ring-nightreigns-challenging-deep-of-night-mode-arrives-check-out-the-patch-notes"><u>released back in September</u></a>, having been discovered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-dataminers-say-theyve-uncovered-an-entirely-new-ultra-hard-game-mode"><u>by dataminers back in August</u></a>. Beyond that, though, there's been very little firm news on what additional content could be on the way. It's worth noting that even though the Kadokawa financial report guarantees the release of the Nightreign DLC by the end of March 2026, that doesn't necessarily mean it <em>won't</em> release before the end of calendar year 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When Elden Ring Nightreign is played exactly as it was designed to be played, it’s one of the finest examples of a three-player co-op game around," we wrote in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review"><u>IGN's 7/10 Elden Ring: Nightreign review</u></a>. "But a lack of crossplay, duo matchmaking, and built-in communication tools makes it hard to create the conditions needed to have this kind of experience unless you’re bringing two real-life friends on every run."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
