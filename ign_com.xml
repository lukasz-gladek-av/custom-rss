            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Clearly, all is not well in the world of Call of Duty. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> appears to have struggled for players and sales relatively speaking amid tough competition from the likes of EA’s Battlefield 6 and Embark Studios’ Arc Raiders, and coming out just a year after Black Ops 6. Microsoft is yet to announce a player count or a sales figure for Black Ops 7, nor has it detailed any boost to Game Pass subscriber numbers as a result of its launch. Clearly, it hasn’t met its expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, sales data suggested Black Ops 7 was struggling not just against rival shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a>, but also last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6"><u>Black Ops 6</u></a>. <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Game Business</u></a> reported that Black Ops 7’s European launch saw opening week sales down 63% versus Battlefield 6 during the equivalent launch periods for each shooter, and Black Ops 7 also down by more than 50% versus Black Ops 6. All in all, Black Ops 7 had a “terrible” launch, <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1991924312287429074" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Game Business’ chief Chris Dring said in a post on social media</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, in a shock development, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games">Activision promised never to release Black Ops or Modern Warfare games back to back again</a>. In a statement attributed to "the Call of Duty team" (Treyarch, Sledgehammer, Infinity Ward, Raven Software and co.), Activision admitted “that for some of you, the franchise has not met your expectations fully. To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision continued: “We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year. We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to this week, and Xbox Game Studios boss Matt Booty has painted a slightly rosier picture. When asked about Black Ops 7's performance by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Booty responded to confirm that it's one of the most-played games on Xbox right now, and that he was proud of what the development team was able to achieve. He then said Call of Duty is “its own unique category” because of Activision’s ability to release content via a seasonal model, so the launch isn’t the end of Black Ops 7’s story.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Call of Duty Campaigns</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the quote in full:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Right now, it is one of the most-played games on Xbox. And I’m really proud of what the team did, in terms of feature innovation, moving the franchise forward. Shipping a major franchise like clockwork every year is a really difficult task, and I’m really proud of what the team did to move the franchise forward in that way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And the interesting thing about Call of Duty is, I think that as an IP, it is really well positioned to continue to deliver content for players going forward; the system of seasons. And it’s not just about the launch, but it’s kind of in its own unique category and ability in terms of how the team keeps delivering content throughout the year. So we’re real happy with where we’ve landed with that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid the doom and gloom, Microsoft has said Call of Duty (overall) ended 2025 as the number one franchise on Game Pass for total players and hours all year, which perhaps doesn’t come as much of a surprise given this is Call of Duty we’re talking about. But it does show that even when Call of Duty has a bad year relative to previous games in the series, it's still massively popular relative to other games.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty is now at something of a crossroads. 2026’s Call of Duty game is almost certainly a continuation of Modern Warfare from Infinity Ward, but what will 2027 bring? Black Ops 8? Activision’s failure to establish a third Call of Duty sub-brand means that it has become overly reliant on Modern Warfare and Black Ops to keep the franchise going at the player numbers executives demand. Could Microsoft take the drastic step of giving Call of Duty a year off to recover from its recent struggles? Given Microsoft paid $69 billion for Activision Blizzard, it seems unlikely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Black Ops 7 in the here and now, Activision has promised "unprecedented season support," saying it "won't rest until Black Ops 7 earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games we’ve ever made."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Following official confirmation that Leon S. Kennedy will co-star in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a>, the game's developers have confirmed how much we'll be playing as the floppy-hair favorite — and it's good news for his fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-dual-protagonist-system-will-be-like-repeatedly-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna-we-ask-the-devs-about-leons-role-and-re4-style/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, director Akifumi Nakanishi revealed that Requiem features nearly equal screentime between Leon and the previously-revealed Grace Ashcroft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In terms of gameplay, Grace and Leon's playable sections are almost equally split," Nakanishi said, likening the game's structure as similar to Resident Evil: Revelations, which featured both Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's almost like having two games with completely different types of tension mixed together," Nakanishi continued. "Early on, we worried players might not be able to keep up, but now we feel that the contrast gives the game a unique rhythm, like jumping into a cold bath after sitting in a hot sauna (laughs)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nakanishi went on to describe Leon's playable sections as a "release" after the intense horror of playing as the less-experienced Grace. But don't expect Leon's gameplay to be a doddle — as the hero will also put himself in danger to protect others. Surely Capcom won't kill him off?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The battle this time will probably push Leon to his limits more than ever before, and this is a crucial part of the experience," Nakanishi noted. "He's the type who doesn't hesitate to sacrifice himself to save others, but he's not arrogant about it, and he has a passionate inner self. I hope you'll also look forward to the dry wit and subtle sarcasm that only an older guy can bring."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Resident Evil Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom knows that Leon has a passionate set of fans, and it sounds like the game will lean into that — making him a "handsome" figure who's "cool personality-wise too." Last night's trailer showed him driving  a custom-built Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT, something Capcom has secured an official license from the car company to include.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Although he’s a character who carries a lot on his shoulders, we took a lot of care in refining him to be an 'ikeoji' (a cool/attractive older guy)," Nakanishi concluded. "The reactions to the trailer on that front have made us happy (laughs)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Leon's involvement now being confirmed, Requiem may still have secrets left in store. There was no mention tonight of a potential third playable character — something raised earlier this week by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-gamestop-listing-leaves-fans-bewildered-by-mentioning-a-shock-second-character-and-its-not-leon">a GameStop listing that referenced Rosemary Winters</a>.

If Playground Games is in the Dev Direct, it seems likely we’ll get a closer look at Forza Horizon 6 and, potentially, the next Fable game, both of which are in the works at the UK studio. Beyond that, perhaps we’ll see more of Gears of War: E-Day and Halo: Campaign Evolved, both of which are confirmed 2026 releases.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But, also based on Booty’s comments, perhaps Microsoft will follow up January’s Dev Direct with showcases that focus on individual games, just to make sure they get enough time in the spotlight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s going to be a real banner year for the brand and a banner year for some of our biggest franchises to show up across the industry,” Booty continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps we’ll also hear more on Microsoft’s hardware plans, which include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-funny-that-people-think-about-the-console-pc-as-two-different-things-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-drops-biggest-hint-yet-that-the-next-xbox-is-basically-a-pc">a next-gen console that sounds a lot like a PC</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
