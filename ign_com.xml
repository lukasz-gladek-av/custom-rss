The push your luck card and dice game by Mantic Games is a fun, pick-up-and-play experience for two or more players. It comes in a relatively small box, making it a good small gift or game to take on camping trips to pass the time. With season 3 of Prime Video's Invincible animated show now over, this sale is the perfect opportunity to spend more time with these characters and the Invincible universe.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Invincible: The Dice Game Deal on Amazon Today</h2><div catalogid="0f16c122-5ccd-4d6f-97dd-b9089e6c0195" id="218922"><div id="218922" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Invincible: The Dice Game is 44% off on Amazon</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are looking to join the Guardians of the Globe by assuming the role of new recruits, taking on other heroes and fighting various villains. Earn enough reputation points, and you win. Be warned, however: your resources are limited to the amount of dice available in your pool, so strategy is the name of the game.

A lot happens in these episodes – Mark wrestles with the ethics of killing, other characters die or nearly die, and new villains arrive from other galaxies or dimensions – even though little of it feels conclusive. The door is left open to several possible developments – especially when it comes to Mark’s evolving morality."

It promises that Marvel will return to the fan-favorite series come July 9 with Marvel Swimsuit Special: Friends, Foes, and Rivals #1. The story will give Earth’s Mightiest Heroes a much-needed break from the stresses of saving the world, but more importantly, the comic book giant teases that the run will include a sneak peek at designs for Marvel Rivals.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/18/marvel-swimsuit-special-1744986484621.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Marvel Swimsuit Special art. Image courtesy of Marvel.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Roxxon Comics is at it again when they release their own UNAUTHORIZED SWIMSUIT SPECIAL,” a description for the Marvel Swimsuit Special says. “Wasp is on the case and seizes the opportunity for Marvel’s heroes to do their OWN swimwear fashion shoot all over the world! But fear not, True Believers, we know what you’re REALLY here for! This super-sized special features splash page after splash page of gorgeous art, but with a story so you can pretend you’re ‘reading it for the articles…’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, Marvel doesn’t share much about when these summer designs will launch or which characters will be included in the collection. It’s also important to note that today’s post doesn’t outright confirm that these skins will specifically be part of a swimsuit set, but considering the special’s subject matter, it would make sense to at least see some summer cosmetics included. We’ll learn more about the Marvel Swimsuit Special in the months ahead, so let’s hope future news comes with more information about how it ties into Marvel Rivals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals launched in December and quickly became a popular distraction for multiplayer fans across PC and consoles. Its competitive nature and vast character pool have had players scheming up new ways to rise through the ranks, but while many focus on improving their performance, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-fear-netease-is-planting-fake-hero-leaks-to-throw-off-dataminers-but-whats-really-going-on">others are far more concerned with NetEase’s plans for post-launch support</a>. One idea that has attracted the attention of armies of fans is the hope they may one day see a Marvel Rivals swimsuit collection come to the game, and now, we know that their prayers will likely soon be answered.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Regarding launch timing, there are a few clues we can look at when guessing when swimsuits may be included. We know that Marvel Rivals Season 2 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-2-update-patch-notes-introduce-emma-frost-ahead-of-launch-this-week">brought Emma Frost and the Hellfire Gala to the hero shooter experience</a> just last week. With the season set to end in about three months, we can guess that the new outfits should launch with Season 3 sometime around July or August. It’s a window that makes sense based on both NetEase’s previously promised schedule while letting fans soak up the sun just before summer comes to an end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also launching alongside Season 3 is NetEase’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-says-its-feeling-social-media-pressure-to-keep-the-game-as-exciting-as-it-has-been-since-december-announced-big-season-3-shake-up">new post-launch plans</a>. Instead of three-month seasons, Marvel Rivals fans can look forward to snappier seasons that last only about two months. That means at least one new playable hero will be included every month for the foreseeable future.
