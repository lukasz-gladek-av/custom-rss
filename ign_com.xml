            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Text-based games, management RPGs, and visual novels – of whatever kind – rarely make the most exciting previews. It's just not easy to build a rich interest in the world and characters of a story you can only get the slightest taste of. I'm very pleased to say that a few hours with Sovereign Tower broke that trend entirely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whosoever turns the key in the giant magic lock on the tower becomes king. So, as the mystically-appointed lord of the tower, your poor faceless wanderer becomes a very important person overnight in what developer Wild Wits calls a "story-rich, Round Table management RPG." It's an entertaining concept that draws its characters and dialogue equally from fantastical tradition and modern life. Couple that with a deliciously detailed art style and a sense of what's most entertaining to do in both management games and visual novels. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's enough to sell it, I think, but it also has some nice surprises and a weird little twist on the genre as a whole. I had a pretty darn good time with it, and I'm looking forward to more.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">King of the Castle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In each turn of Sovereign Tower, you have to do two things: accept audiences, then assign knights from your round table to various quests. Taking audiences is a simple concept: Sit on the throne and deal with problems people bring you. The decisions you make there can alter the path of the story, bring up new quests for your knights, or avoid problems. They'll also affect the sovereign's standing with the realm's four factions: the Nobility, People, Merchants, and Scholars. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some problems go away if you just throw money at  them, and the taxes you get at the start of every cycle can pay for some of that—but those are the same taxes you use to pay for stuff like cool new swords and horses and magic potions, so do you really want to spend them on boring stuff like bridges or whatever? Probably not.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sovereign Tower Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That sounds pretty normal, but it's the weirdos that show up to need things from you or to join your kingdom that make it memorable. I encountered a stinky jester, proud emissaries unable to admit they couldn't solve their own problems, clever peasants, annoying nobles, and even an assassin. Talking with them solidifies the personality of your blank-slate Sovereign, raising their stats in Audacity, Tyranny, Wisdom, and Kindness to unlock alternate decisions in future events.</p><p>It's the weirdos that show up to need things from you or to join your kingdom that make it memorable.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Knights are the flavor that'll really have to carry the game, and from what I saw they might do it. I met a huge guy that acted like a child, a very fancy boy, an extremely overdramatic guy, a nice lady who loved forest critters, the most goth knight ever, and even a straight-up actual wolf. Each of them had their own unique little events and dialogue that popped up from time to time, each of which affected your sovereign's relationship with them. They also had history to learn, as well as more straightforward stats, all of which affect their performance on missions.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-08-1769118770111.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Figuring out which knight would be best for each quest was an actually interesting choice. Equipment like a specific horse to ride, a sword to use, or a magic potion can give them temporary stat boosts, but it's often the bonuses or penalties from their personality traits that make the difference between a failure and success or between mere success and an outstanding victory. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example if you're doing something that's a bit of public relations? Probably should send the more charismatic knight, but not the really arrogant one. Watching each knight's background and figuring out which of the little highlighted keywords apply to the current mission is a fun bit of understanding the characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there's a real penalty for failure. Your knights each have an armor score, which if it goes to zero means that knight's, well, dead and gone. Your blacksmith can only fix one knight's armor each cycle—so you need to be reasonably sure that the task you're sending a knight on is one they can at least survive if they fail.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Shining Armor</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">None of the characters, nor the entire game as I saw it, would have nearly as much personality without the visual art on display in Sovereign Tower, and I've got to take a moment to run through the influences and elements that make it up. Starting with the simple choices of colors to draw from: The warm pastels, earth tones, and jewel tones are lovely, then they're combined with copious golden shades and tints to express lighting. It's a palette of colors that's something between stained glass or rich watercolor on thick paper.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-14-1769118784850.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The characters are drawn with a lot of emotion and movement, too, for what are otherwise relatively flat portraits. You can feel the shrug in how Urusla stands, for example. You can see the carefree attitude in the angle of Angelica's head. And, well, everything about Gideon tells you exactly who he is and how he behaves. It's not just great illustration work in that you can feel the motion, it's that you can immediately start to feel who the characters are just from how they look.</p><p>The characters are drawn with a lot of emotion and movement, too, for what are otherwise relatively flat portraits.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's clear that these are artists who understand how to work their chosen medium, and if you'll put up with me for a nerd moment, it is deeply reminiscent of the Art Nouveau period in design from France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Particularly the advertisements, posters, and calendars of justly-famous artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_Mucha" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Alphonse Mucha</u></a>. It's a fitting choice, too: Mucha's work often used the kind of medieval romantic and even fairytale themes that Sovereign Tower seems to use in its stories—I imagine he'd approve of being the inspiration here.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-03-1769118800769.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I think that's where I'd place this whole game's artistic style, too: It's a blend of medieval fantasy and Arthurian romance setting, the art of Mucha, and the writing of a wryly clever modern comic book. There's basically nothing to dislike in that.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Clever Twist</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not a surprise to people who like this kind of game that there are going to be secret events and pathways through the story to uncover, as well as desperate outcomes and painful prices to pay when choosing poorly at certain decision points. I found that Sovereign Tower must have more than a few, since I managed to stumble into at least two hidden story outcomes while playing just by assigning an unexpected or suboptimal knight to a specific quest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The frustration with these kinds of events, however, is that they can give you unwanted outcomes or change the story when you weren't expecting them to or were aiming for another outcome. The only choice you've got at that point is often to play the entire visual novel over again just to see a new path or the immediate consequence of a tough choice.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/screenshot-02-1769118819660.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The real good choice that Sovereign Tower makes is to have a built-in do-over mechanic. See, there's a demon that lives in a cage in the tower basement, which I'm sure isn't scary or plot-relevant at all because the demon helps you do something very useful: Step back in time. Don't worry—the demon assures me this is because it has absolutely no bad intentions and is bound to help you—much like all the other magical things that live in the tower.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the demon's help you can turn back time, especially when some choice you've made would lead to a disastrous end. I expect you'll also be able to use the power to avoid the worst ends in the game, and I'm betting most players will want to use it at least once or twice to avoid making whatever NPC they've chosen to romance not mad at them about something. There's also the hint, given in the trailer and screenshots for Sovereign Tower, that you'll be able to use the demon's power to unlock alternate dialogue in situations you've seen before—tagged with an "Omniscience" stat that surely won't upset or alarm people who don't realize you're time travelling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, from the art and the writing, I'm pretty intrigued by Sovereign Tower and it's going on my list of games to watch out for. Sure, the game mechanics are pretty simple, but when the story and characters are interesting in this way I'm glad the game rules are getting out of the way to let me entertain myself—failing and succeeding on my own terms.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/sovereign-tower-preview-hands-on-with-this-unique-arthurian-round-table-management-rpg]]></content:encoded>

They’re available at the Nintendo Store for $34.99, with a release date of March 12.</p><div id="234668"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234668" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Talking Flower</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing to note is that this is not exactly a kids’ toy geared towards play. It’s more of a decoration that occasionally talks. You set it on a desk, shelf, or bedside table, and the thing will say something periodically (Nintendo says it speaks roughly twice an hour). It says things like, “Is it weird for flowers to talk?” Or, “Sometimes it’s nice to space out.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has a button you can press to make it talk on command. If you press the button repeatedly, it will utter “special phrases,” whatever that means. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Talking Flower doesn’t have any built-in AI and it’s not connected to an LLM. It doesn’t have a microphone, so it’s not listening like an Amazon Echo, and you can’t hold a conversation with it. But it does have a built-in clock, so it can make comments about the time of day it is. It can also sense the temperature and make comments about that. </p></div><div id="183351"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="183351" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It can also make the sound from the game when you get a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/super-mario-bros-wonder/Wonder_Seed_Locations">Wonder seed</a> and the level transforms. It then plays music, and you can press the button in time with the music to make it react.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can have it speak in the morning when you want to wake up, like an alarm clock (lookin’ at you, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-nintendo-alarmo">Alarmo</a>). You can also press and hold the button to make it be quiet for a while. It also won’t talk over night. The Talking Flower supports 11 languages. If you want one of your own, you can <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxe07P?object_uuid=af91a900-9ec9-4fe1-8f1b-f8f2a21c7bde&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder now</a> at the Nintendo Store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Super Mario Bros. Wonder news, the game is getting a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade, plus a new expansion called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-edition-release-date-plus-elephant-mario-and-captain-toad-amiibo">Meetup in Bellabell Park</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Animal Crossing: New Horizons got a big 3.0 update earlier this month, which alongside a lot of new content for everyone included a Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade with some fancy technological buffs. One of those was the ability to play with up to 12 total people on the same island, up from eight in the original version.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sounds fun, right? Wrong. It's a nightmare. A nightmare once again spawned by Nintendo handling online functionality in the most ridiculous way possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was so foolish and naive a week ago, when I first had the idea to get 12 of us together for an Animal Crossing session. It would be easy, I thought! So easy, I originally didn't even plan on writing anything about it! Let me just call up...11 other people I know who are still playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who also have Nintendo Switch 2s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And somehow we'll manage to find an hour we can all do this, despite everyone being busy adults.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, harder than I thought, but we did it! Last night, a group of 12 of us all logged on at once with a plan to meet up on my island. We considered using the Game Chat functionality, but decided against it due to lack of compatibility with Bluetooth headsets, the function's friending requirements, and the fact that you can't take screenshots while Game Chat is active. Discord it was, then, apparently still the second-best place for Nintendo Voice Chat (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/nintendo-voice-chat">after the podcast, of course</a>).</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092311-01kfk4k4x1qaac3z7dje12vshc-1769104423045.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The plan was for an hour-long session from 9pm to 10pm last night, but I recalled that the cutscene for people landing on the island was a bit lengthy, and we'd have to watch it 11 times, so I logged on half an hour early to open my island so we could start filtering in. I was hopeful that with improved Nintendo Switch 2 loading times, it might not be so bad. And it's true, the actual loading times were notably faster, though most of the wait for people to land is a combination of said cutscene ("We'll be making a water landing, but that's OK because this is a seaplane.") and everyone saving the game each time, so we didn't really shorten the wait by that much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But all that was to be expected. Here was where the nightmare began.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At 8:35pm, my friends began trickling in. We managed to get three people in before the entire session crashed, booting out everyone who had showed up so far and shutting my islands gates for me. I reopened at 8:46pm and we started again, this time creating a "queue" in our Discord text chat so everyone didn't try to flood in at once. At 8:58pm, one of my friends got an error that kicked her out alongside one other person, but everyone else stayed, so we brought them back and continued down the line.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092308-01kfk4hw7zj58ec37nepwcgtp8-1769104446457.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">At 9:19pm, I typed in Discord, "WE DID IT" as person #12 seemingly landed successfully.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At 9:21pm, as person #12 strolled in, another error occurred and two other people got kicked out. At this point, my husband (who was playing Ace Attorney next to me) started rolling his eyes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At 9:24pm, one of the people who had been kicked out tried to rejoin, errored out, and the whole session crashed again. Every single person got booted back to their islands and my gates were closed again, just as we were finally about to taste success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Please enjoy this timelapse video, courtesy of our intrepid Wiki writer KBABZ, of 40 minutes of us trying desperately to get everyone onto the island, only for the unthinkable to happen right at the very end:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I was undaunted. By golly, we got all these people together, we were going to hit each other with nets and drop recipe cards for each other! We started again from the top. This time I forbade everyone from doing anything once they landed aside from standing still in a line next to the airport. No menuing. No talking to villagers. Nothing. Folks started coming back in at 9:27pm. At 9:37pm, the fourth person to join crashed the island again. At 9:39pm, almost 40 minutes after our planned start time, we began yet again. Everyone posted cat pics in the Discord channel for emotional support.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092312-01kfk4kh4kd89e5tn3ez40q8zk-1769104468431.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This time worked. Finally, at 10:05pm, after multiple crashes and false starts, we had 12 people on my Animal Crossing island.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092315-01kfk4mbwv3js65mw1jeptph91-1769104494893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm happy to report that after the <em>90 minute ordeal</em> that was getting 12 people onto one island, online play actually worked great. We all exchanged gifts, took a pic in the Town Square, explored the island, and got coffee at Brewster's. People wrote on my bulletin board and sent me letters. Some borrowed my Wario costume from the hotel. A couple people decided to play pranks, burying junk and trapping my villagers with holes. It was genuinely a pretty great time. It just, you know, took way too dang long to set up.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092320-01kfk4pdtcz6we4gfvt9j2an9t-1769104494893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It's baffling to me that Nintendo's infrastructure for Animal Crossing is still set up this way. Yes, the island landing cutscene is very cute, and I do think the sea plane line is pretty funny. But why on earth do we need to sit through it 11 times, with everyone who's not traveling collectively watching a mostly-blank airport-themed loading screen? Why does everything on my island need to completely freeze and exit menus so someone can come in? Why does Group Stretching require me to be Best Friends with everyone on my island? How much worse would all this have been if we had used Game Chat? Mario Kart World doesn't have this problem!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092323-01kfk4q36ntgqn62xk8tmvvetf-1769104494893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The best explanation I can think of is that Nintendo genuinely didn't intend for anyone to use this feature in the first place. Animal Crossing: New Horizons' 3.0 update is fun, sure, but it's not creating the same massive surge in interest that existed in 2020 when we were all locked at home and had nothing better to do than ponder whatever it is that Dodos do. You're unlikely to ever need to collect 11 friends and drag them to your island all at once. Heck, given how hard this was to schedule, I'll be lucky to get four one of these weekends.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092325-01kfk4qm2h3qkextzwa2w2j5v7-1769104494893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is still very fun to play with friends, but it's still a massive pain in the butt to actually set up the circumstances for that play to be possible. Next time I'll just get everyone together for Jackbox.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/20260122092326-01kfk4qyknppc2dj0vk9fw215x-1769104546250.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We're still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-big-30-update-just-dropped-a-day-early">checking out the big 3.0 update</a> and all the fun new stuff that's been added.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Game Freak's upcoming action game Beast of Reincarnation reemerged at the Xbox Developer Direct, with a lengthy segment showing off traversal, combat, its cast of characters, some dang good music, and more. Also, great news, it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-gets-new-look-at-actionrpg-hybrid-combat-and-a-summer-release-window">apparently out this summer</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beast of Reincarnation is a fascinating new game, and an anomaly in Game Freak's portfolio. Game Freak is, of course, best-known for developing Pokemon, a series that's grown in scope as it's transitioned to home console releases but has also seen notable declines in performance and visual quality. But Game Freak has also been increasing its other independent endeavors in recent years, with games such as HarmoKnight, Tembo the Badass Elephant, and Pocket Card Jockey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But aside from Pokemon all of those have been fairly small-scale endeavors. Though we haven't gotten our hands on Beast of Reincarnation yet, this <em>looks</em> far more ambitious. It's a full-on action game, for one, with what seems to be pretty complex and multi-layered combat and movement. It's also, if the trailers are any indication, really pretty, and a departure from Game Freak's historically more cartoony style. That's led to plenty of questions as to what led Game Freak to make something like this in the first place, and whether or not the studio can pull it off. At least from what we saw today, there's reason for optimism.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I sat down with Kota Furushima, game director of Beast of Reincarnation, to chat about some of these topics, as well as get some further details on what exactly the game will be. Here's our full interview transcript, very lightly edited for clarity:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Beast of Reincarnation seems very, very different from anything Game Freak has done before. How did this game come to be?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kota Furushima: </strong>So, it all started, I wanted to get something going. It was an original project. I wanted to try something completely different and new, unlike other stuff we've made. And it just so happened that internally, here at Game Freak, we have a program we call the Gear Project, which is sort of an internal contest run by our president, Satoshi Tajiri, to make original IP within the company. So, I entered my design doc into that contest, and I was able to get permission to start working on a project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I should mention too, to clarify, it wasn't so much that I was trying to do something different than what we've done before. I started with the concept of the feeling that I wanted to get across to the users, the feeling of loneliness, isolation, and warmth, and the game design that we have now kind of coalesced naturally around that concept.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How long ago was it that you entered this in the contest?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>It was about six years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Beast of Reincarnation does seem to be a significantly larger game than some of the other, I guess, non-Pokemon projects you've worked on before. Did the studio have to scale up significantly for Beast of Reincarnation?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>The team is quite large, as you can imagine, but I will note that it's not all folks internally here at Game Freak. We managed to seek out a lot of partner companies to work with us, companies, studios that are able to realize the vision of this game in the way that we wanted to make it, so we're lucky to have a lot of people working on it externally as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">[<em>PR reached out post-interview to clarify that the internal Game Freak team working on Beast of Reincarnation is "relatively small" while still playing a core role in leading the project through direction and management.</em>] </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Can you tell me about the original pitch that you entered into the contest, like what that original sort of design looked like?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>So, it was pretty simple at first. The general concept was the idea of taking a journey along with a companion. That was the main pillar of the game, and you started thinking about the feelings you wanted the player to have, and gradually, the design sort of began to coalesce around that idea of the journey with the companion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Was there anything in particular that inspired you throughout the development of the game, other games, film, art, music, just any other art in particular that you were thinking of, as you worked on Beast of Reincarnation?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>Yeah, absolutely. I mentioned I'm a big fan of science fiction movies to start with, and because I wanted to create this new world that no one had seen before, I started really putting a lot of thought into the way world building is done and science fiction. Blade Runner was a specific one that I can mention, that does such a good job of world building. I wanted to try and create my own world in a similar sort of fashion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So, Beast of Reincarnation, I know, was originally announced under the Private Division label when it was part of Take-Two, and then Private Division got acquired, renamed, and is now being run by different people. I'm curious if all those changes impacted the development of Beast of Reincarnation in any way.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima:</strong> There's probably not much I can say about that, to be honest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Okay, tell me a bit about the structure of Beast of Reincarnation. Is it a linear, story focused game? Is it open world, Metroidvania, something else?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>The way we created this game, it is about a journey with a beginning, middle, and end, right? It kind of conjures up images of a road movie sort of thing, so it's not open world in the purest sense. The game is comprised of different stages, but these stages I would not describe as linear either. There's quite a lot of room for exploration, a lot of radiation between the different environments and things of that nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What are you primarily doing in these different stages? Are you primarily fighting creatures? Are you doing more exploration? Are there puzzles? What are the main activities that you're doing as the character?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima:</strong> You're doing a lot of different things in the game. I think there are no traditional puzzles to put block progress, for instance, as you saw them, but there are definitely puzzle adjacent segments of the game. For example, this game takes place in a world that's been largely destroyed, so you could come to a part where you want to get across a chasm, and the bridge has been destroyed, so you have to start thinking, "How can I get across there?" Now, luckily, Emma, the main character, has a lot of abilities at her disposal. She can extend at the vine or plant, I don't know what you call it, her hair actually. I mean, she can use that, for example, to cross a chasm instead of a bridge, right? So she has certain abilities at her disposal that can help her get through this world. Of course, battle is a huge part of the game, as well as exploration. There's definitely parts where you want to see what's off the beaten path as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How challenging is the combat?  I'm curious if there's difficulty settings or if a casual player could pick it up and feel comfortable with counters and things like that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>First of all, I should say that, yes, there are three difficulty settings in the game. As many people to play it as possible, there's going to be story mode. There's a little bit easier, there's normal mode, and then of course there's hard move where enemies are significantly stronger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even in the normal mode, it's important to note that the game is not just played through the single character of Emma. She, of course, has her companion Koo. Koo also has actions that he can use in conjunction with Emma. There's a lot of freedom and variety of what you can do in the game. Beast of Reincarnation is, of course, an action RPG. Players have the freedom to think of their own strategy and the way they're going to tap all certain situations, how to best utilize Emma's abilities and Koo's abilities to suit their own play-style with which they're most comfortable.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Beast of Reincarnation Official Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Can you give me an example of a type of play style you're referring to? Are we thinking the difference between close range and long range? Is it more magical or physical? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>There's a lot of variety in the game. As far as the main actions of the player that Emma is going to undertake for attacks, she largely relies on her Katana for close range attacks. She also has the ability to attack a long range with bows, crossbows, and those sorts of weapons. Koo, of course, relies primarily on what we call bloom arts, which are kind of plant-based attacks in the game. You'll find yourself up against some pretty big enemies, and the rhythm of a lot of the combat does center around pairing, countering, and things of that nature, but you also, again, have an added layer of using Koo and his abilities to your advantage as well, so there's quite a lot of variety there that different people can use in different ways to suit their own style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What can you tell me about Emma and Koo as characters? Who are they? How would you describe them?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>One thing to note is, at the beginning of the game, Emma is kind of a blank slate. She has neither memories nor emotions or feelings when you first meet her. Koo, you'll soon discover, is what are known in this world as malefacts. He has this blight, or this corruption about him. You will notice in the game, too, that Emma herself is also a blighted one, and although this does give her special abilities, the downside of that is, of course, she's not treated well by other humans. She's living a very isolated lifestyle, essentially banished. What we have here, typically in this world, Emma would consider a creature like Koo to be an enemy because he is blighted. She typically fights against these sorts of enemies, so there's a bit of irony in this game, that she ends up teaming up with Koo and they go on this journey together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What can you tell me about the music in Beast of Reincarnation? I really enjoyed the music that I heard in the trailer, and I was curious who was composing it and what the vision and style was.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>So, starting with the concepts of the score, again, the music is very much focused on the game's core concepts themselves, out of loneliness and isolation and learning to rely on people, that sort of motif and sort of feeling. So there's all sorts of different types of songs in the game. There's some focus on amplifying the trusting relationship that Emma develops with Koo. Some focus on the loneliness and despair of the world itself that's been destroyed. Then, we have the bosses in the game, which are called Nushi. Their music tracks tend to focus on more kind of traditional, Japanese sort of instrumentation. They give it a difference as well, so there's a lot of variety in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I know Game Freak has a lot of history of delving into mythology and nature, especially with all the Pokemon designs they've done over the years to create really interesting creatures, and I'm curious if we'll see any particular myths, legends, or types of creatures in the world of Beast of Reincarnation.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>I think what you'll see in the game is a lot of the natural environments, whether it be the plant life, the flora, and the fauna in this game, the animals and the plants are very much based on the plant life and animal life that we see here in Japan and we've seen here in Japan throughout our history. Sakura, cherry blossoms would be a good example of that. It definitely has a sort of a local feel, in terms of the creatures that you'll meet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Game Freak has received some criticism in the past few years for the performance and look of some of its 3D open world games. Beast of Reincarnation looks to be fairly ambitious. What would you say to those who are concerned that it might struggle in the same ways?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>I think when it comes to Beast of Reincarnation, and I guess we would regard it as the scale and the ambition of the title, when we approach game design, we're not looking to make, say, a title of a certain level of quality. We're looking to deliver a very specific game experience, and visual fidelity and graphics, this is something that supports that game experience, everything that goes into that. That includes things like bug fixing, optimization. Everything is there to serve the gameplay and the experience. Our focus is on that gameplay experience. Part of that, of course, is making sure that it performs really well, but our attention is more on getting the experience over to you and making sure that our vision can get to your hands and your hearts.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/beast-of-reincarnation-heroart-1769108376624.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Beast of Reincarnation official artwork.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What can you tell me about the, I guess they're called the Nushi, the bosses. In the presentation I saw they create these blighted forests, and that the environment will change. Can you tell me a little more about that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>The Nushi, as you said, they're kind of bosses in the game, but sitting above the Nushi is the ultimate presence in the game, the Beast of Reincarnation itself, which the game is named after, Emma and Koo essentially start their journey to defeat the Beast of Reincarnation, but in order to do that, they face off against Nushi on the way there as a way to sort of weaken the Beast of Reincarnation and make it a boss they can actually take on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, as you defeat these Nushi, you get new abilities from them, and you continue on your journey to ultimately face off against the Beast of Reincarnation. You touched on the blighted forest as well. So the Nushi, Beast of Reincarnation, again, is the reason that the world is kind of in this fall and corroded and blighted state. The Nushi themselves create these blighted forests around them, as you noted. The environment actually changes. From there, from those forests, the enemies in the game, the biological enemies, the Malefacts, are also kind of part and parcel with what it is that the Nushis are bringing into the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Does that imply that something we'll be doing is going back and revisiting areas we've been before, when the blighted forest is there or not there?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>There's a couple of parts to that question there. So, one thing to note, simply defeating a Nushi is not really enough to change the environment in a really meaningful way. Ultimately, the Beast of Reincarnation has kind of a grasp on all of the land and has kind of turned it this way, so you're not able to make huge changes to the environment by defeating Nushi, but you can absolutely go back to places you've been, and you're oftentimes going to want to explore and find hidden areas and items and things of that nature. There's plenty of secrets to discover in places that essentially you've already been through, you're able to freely go back and keep exploring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is that because she has these plant hair abilities. I assume she's getting more of these, as you progress, that are going to unlock more things. Is that right?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>Actually, there's not a lot of that sort of exploration in the game. You're basically able to get where you need to go with your default abilities. The real question is how. You can see a place you want to go, but do you know how to get there yet? I think, as the player gets more and more accustomed to using these abilities, you'll start to get inspired and understand you're leveling up, I guess, as a player, rather than the character getting abilities that will unlock kind of locations and places. It's more about coming to terms with, getting a grip on, and getting better at using those abilities yourself as a player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You guys have a really long, historical relationship with Nintendo. Is there any chance we'll see this game come to Nintendo Switch 2 eventually?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>There's nothing to announce right now about other platforms that have not already been announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I have one more question. Can you pet the dog?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Furushima: </strong>Yes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?
