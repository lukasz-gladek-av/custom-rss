            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Distinct Possibility Studio, a new development team comprised of industry veterans including longtime Sony Online Entertainment boss John Smedley, has announced its first project: a large-scale persistent online open-world first-person shooter called Reaper Actual. It's in development for PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a PvPvEvE game ‚Äì sort of akin to an MMOFPS ‚Äì set on the fictional island of Marova, which Smedley tells IGN is four times the size of Call of Duty Warzone's biggest map. You play a Reaper ‚Äì effectively, a mercenary ‚Äì and work for different factions. Up to 200 players can be on one server, and you'll be able to join Outfits (read: clans), use vehicles, and own bases ‚Äì and of course raid them. Meanwhile, the AI is also playing against each other, and the human players can choose to get involved. Check out the first trailer for the Unreal Engine 5-powered game above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Reaper Actual - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Distinct Possibility describes Reaper Actual's persistent online island as such: "Victories and defeats reshape the island‚Äôs control between PvP fights and NPC factions in real-time. Players will have a progression and crafting system to build the best gear, all of which stays in the world." Meanwhile, the studio's chief creative officer, Matt Higby, said, ‚ÄúWe are moving toward the next level of persistent FPS combat. Players want a world they can live in and build upon. Having a solid base is only the start in Reaper Actual. Once faction missions interweave with PvP combat, the world becomes a swirling battleground of options for players. Mix that with a full crafting system and Reapers will grow every time you log in to play.‚Äù</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Left 4 Dead Director-style AI, Cerberus, will dynamically put players in conflict with each other by dishing out competing objectives for different Outfits.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Core player experiences are being designed around 3-4 player groups, with larger-scale Planetside 2-type scenarios as well. Meanwhile, their Left 4 Dead Director-style AI, Cerberus, will dynamically put players in conflict with each other by dishing out competing objectives for different Outfits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, they're extending the in-game economy outside of the game with opt-in web3 elements; the Steam and Epic Games Store versions of Reaper Actual won't have any web3 components, but players who wish to participate can opt-in to user-generated content by crafting guns and gear, with renting and modding servers also an option. If you're interested in participating in player testing, you can do so on the <a href="https://reaperactual.firstlook.gg/signup/foundationplayer" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Reaper Actual website</a>.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/reaper-actual-a-large-scale-persistent-online-military-fps-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plans to relaunch the game.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy, the Edinburgh, Scotland-based developer of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a>, has issued at-risk emails to its around 300-strong UK workforce following the disastrous launch of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sources familiar with the goings on inside the embattled studio told IGN at-risk emails were also sent to staff at PlayFusion, which BARB acquired late 2024. PlayFusion, whose CEO Mark Gerhard became co-CEO of BARB as part of the buyout, is working on a different game ‚Äî a fast-paced FPS called Ascendant which was meant to come out this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">IGN reported that BARB had begun a redundancy process following the release of MindsEye</a>. The standard 45-day consultation process kicked off on June 23, which according to UK law is triggered when an employer proposes 100 or more redundancies within a 90-day period. IGN understands Build A Rocket Boy currently has around 300 UK employees, with 200 abroad.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, BARB issued a statement confirming the redundancy process, insisting the cuts will let the studio ‚Äúfocus on delivering ongoing updates and performance optimization for MindsEye, while also ensuring the long-term success of Build A Rocket Boy‚Äôs future ambitions.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Soon after MindsEye launched, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-heartbroken-amid-troubled-launch-as-players-report-success-with-refunds-and-sponsored-streams-are-canceled-last-minute"><u>BARB said it was ‚Äúheartbroken‚Äù over the issues players had faced with the game</u></a>, and promised to release a series of patches to fix the significant performance problems, glitches, and AI behavior bugs. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-releases-performance-improvement-hotfix-as-first-in-series-of-emergency-patches-designed-to-address-disastrous-launch"><u>Rollout of these patches has begun</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the while, MindsEye‚Äôs troubled launch saw the developer cancel sponsored streams, with reports of players securing refunds, even from the normally stubborn Sony, surfacing online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, which does not paint the whole picture of MindsEye‚Äôs current popularity, the game hit a peak concurrent player count of 3,302 on launch, but had a 24-hour peak of just 46 players. At the time of this article‚Äôs publication, 26 people were playing on Steam, where MindsEye has a 'mostly negative' user review rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Story-driven action adventure game MindsEye was initially designed to be a part of Everywhere, the ‚ÄòRoblox for adults‚Äô creation platform led by former Grand Theft Auto design chief Leslie Benzies. BARB eventually switched to focus on MindsEye, but it has so-far failed to do the business for the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, BARB sources told IGN that Benzies finally addressed staff following the release of MindsEye in a brief video call yesterday, July 2. According to two people present who asked not to be named in order to protect their careers, Benzies insisted BARB would bounce back and relaunch MindsEye, blaming the studio and the game‚Äôs struggles on internal and external saboteurs, among other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The comments rekindle memories of those issued by Mark Gerhard ahead of the release of MindsEye. The co-CEO hit the headlines for claiming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments"><u>there was a "concerted effort" by some to "trash the game and the studio,"</u></a> suggesting people were being paid or using spam bots to post negative comments. The boss of publisher IO Interactive, which makes the Hitman games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye"><u>subsequently issued a denial</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BARB sources told IGN that internally, there is a desire for a MindsEye redemption arc that would eventually see it become successful for the studio. But as staff face an anxious wait to discover their fate, there are serious questions over whether BARB will be able to fulfill its post-launch roadmap for content, including the promised multiplayer mode, on time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, BARB released MindsEye‚Äôs third post-release update on console, with a PC release to follow. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve watched hundreds of hours of gameplay footage and reviewed player feedback across multiple channels to prioritize the most pressing issues and improve the experience for all our console players,‚Äù the studio said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
