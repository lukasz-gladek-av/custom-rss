But the moment I saw the Charizard ex Super Premium Collection on sale, something in my brain short-circuited. My body? Fully ready for yet <em>another</em> unnecessary purchase. And at <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yXRm6?object_uuid=d18afbef-ba9c-4fc0-b09c-5dbe79fed3de&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">under $50, this box is stacked</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re getting a foil Charizard ex promo, plus matching Charmander and Charmeleon to complete the fiery trio. There’s even a Charizard display figure (because, of course, there is), and—get this—ten booster packs. Not five. Not six. Ten. That’s ten chances to pull something ridiculous. </p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218886"><div id="218886" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG Charizard ex Super Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The set includes packs from Twilight Masquerade, Stellar Crown, Paradox Rift, Temporal Forces, and Obsidian Flames—some of the most exciting recent drops in the TCG lineup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help you further in your quest for great pulls, here are some of my favorite chase cards from these Pokémon TCG sets. Or, if you're done with chasing singles in boosters and fancy just picking up a couple of single cards instead of splashing out on this deal, I've included some handy offers from TCG Player to make sure you're getting the best price.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Twilight Masquerade Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I want Perrin and Hisuian Growlithe purely for the art. GIDORA nailed the emotional bond between a Trainer and her Pokémon, and the way the two illustrations pair up makes pulling just one feel like an incomplete thought. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other end of the spectrum, Dragapult ex is is terrifyingly efficient and might be the best Pokémon ex in the set. Carmine is the real money card here though, continuing the trend of playable, stylish Trainer cards dominating the top of the market. Throw in cozy Eevee vibes and a surprisingly playable Ursaluna, and you’ve got a set with range.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Stellar Crown Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Stellar Crown is what happens when nostalgia and artistry shake hands. Squirtle and Bulbasaur show off their bird-watching hobbies in some of the most charming cards I’ve seen in years. Then there’s Terapagos ex, which looks like it belongs in a jewelry store, not a binder. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hydrapple and Dachsbun are slightly more niche but still desirable thanks to lush illustrations and just enough playability to make you think twice before selling. I think this set knows what it's doing: hook you with Kanto starters, then keep you around with glittering, high-rarity flex pulls.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Paradox Rift Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Paradox Rift wants to make a statement. Roaring Moon ex is the best pull here, both in power and price, and Groudon isn’t far behind with volcanic drama cranked to eleven. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Iron Valiant and Altaria offer very different flavors of future aesthetic, and somehow they both work. Iron Hands ex might not be pretty, but it’s still a beast in competitive decks. If you're after a set that brings both gorgeous artwork and raw pressure, this is the one to crack.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Temporal Forces Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Temporal Forces is part prehistoric brawl, part retro sci-fi. Raging Bolt ex leads the pack with one of the strongest attacks in Standard, and Iron Crown ex isn’t far behind, fueling Future decks with wild efficiency. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walking Wake ex wins big on artwork alone, thanks to Suicune’s eternal popularity, and Gouging Fire holds its own with surprise jungle-dino energy. Even Iron Leaves ex has sneaky-good utility. I want every single one of these cards for a different reason, which is exactly how a good set should work.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Obsidian Flames Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex is the undisputed king here, with two of the most sought-after variants in the entire block. The Special Illustration Rare version is especially gorgeous, all fire and fury, while the gold Hyper Rare keeps things flashy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninetales and Cleffa bring artistic value, and I think Cleffa might be the most unexpectedly stunning card in the set. Pidgeot ex also deserves a shout for balancing playability with an ultra-stylized take on a Gen I classic. This is one of those sets where almost every big pull earns its spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/tempest-rising-review-single-player-campaign</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tempest-rising-review-single-player-campaign.1167009/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tempest-rising-review-single-player-campaign<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: This review specifically covers the single-player campaigns of Tempest Rising. For thoughts on multiplayer, stand by until after launch.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was only a matter of time before someone got tired of waiting for EA to announce a new Command &amp; Conquer real-time strategy game without canceling it a few months later, and finally, Danish developer Slipgate Ironworks has become the one to take matters into its own hands. Tempest Rising plays like a C&amp;C game with the serial number filed off, and it does a fairly good job of scratching the itch for this style of fast-paced action with two very traditional but well-made campaigns set to the tune of a familiar soundtrack partly composed by distinctive C&amp;C composer Frank Klepacki. Given how closely it follows that template, though, it’s a little disappointing that it didn’t have more fun building personality and atmosphere between missions.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tempest Rising Single-Player Campaign Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">How closely, exactly? Aside from how it replicates the plate-spinning gameplay and basic tech tree (as many have done over the past 30 years), you could easily just change a few names – GDF to GDI and Tempest to Tiberium, for example – and Tempest Rising would be fairly indistinguishable from a C&amp;C iteration as you’re harvesting resources, building a base, and cranking out infantry, tanks, and aircraft that die in seconds if you’re not paying close attention when they encounter the enemy. Some of the similarities are amusingly on the nose: The Nod-like Dynasty faction’s barracks structure is shaped like giant hands reaching up from the ground, and they didn’t bother changing the name of the Mobile Construction Vehicle (MCV) that expands into your base’s central Construction Yard building at all. So yes, it’s pretty close!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The campaigns’ story is treated in much the same lovingly derivative way, reframing the GDI/Nod conflict as between the good guy Global Defense <s>Initiative</s> Force and the paramilitary Dynasty faction fighting for territory in Europe and northern Africa, though here it’s set in the aftermath of a Cuban Missile Crisis where things went much worse than they did for us. You wouldn’t really know that it’s a post-World War 3 world, though, because other than some wrecked roads on the battlefields, the regional maps in the briefings look pretty normal, and none of the missions take place anywhere recognizable. But more importantly, it’s missing a few of C&amp;C’s secret ingredients – chief among them a good villain. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We don’t get any good mustache-twirling villain moments like attacking the Pentagon or Eiffel Tower.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So much of the personality of the classic C&amp;C games came from the evil Nod faction and its mysteriously ageless leader, Kane (played with wild-eyed zeal by Joe Kucan). Granted, the Dynasty leaders who brief you before every mission have more character than the generic, gruff-voiced general of the GDF, but the constantly sneering Aleks can’t hold a candle to Kane. You can't build a cult of personality around a grumpy guy in a beret, and beyond being black leather fetishists, the Dynasty doesn’t have a lot going on ideologically – they’re not even explicitly framed as fascist bad guys out for global domination (especially when compared to the shadowy council pulling the GDF’s strings) so we don’t get any good mustache-twirling villain moments like attacking the Pentagon or Eiffel Tower. Without something like that to get invested in – and coupled with some instances of comically poor voice acting – I was unmotivated to sit through the multiple strings of optional dialogue that give you more bland background on the lore but nothing else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a day and age when anyone with a smartphone can replace their Zoom background with a high-tech command center or dark and ominous paramilitary headquarters, I’m sad Slipgate wasn’t granted the resources to do C&amp;C-style live-action cutscenes and get someone to follow in Tim Curry’s legendary footsteps by chewing the virtual scenery to pieces. These generic animated characters just can’t compete, especially when there was clearly no budget to even match mouth movements to dialogue on most of them (conspicuously, both factions have lieutenants who give you orders through gas masks for no reason). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to actual real-time strategy, though, Tempest Rising fares much better. It may be playing within the constraints of a very defined genre and style, but it looks nice, runs well (it only crashed on me when loading a specific saved game), its interface is modern and friendly, and it’s pretty good at finding ways to be inventive with its faction design. Once you get past basic infantry, just about everything has a special ability or a twist to it that you’ll want to spend some time learning to use and decide if it’s worth your time to micromanage, as opposed to selecting everything and sending it into the attack-move meat grinder. There are too many to list, but the GDF’s heavy use of drone controller units is a fun one: you can control them independently to scout within a radius, you can pack their pilots into an APC or transport chopper and they'll still fly around and shoot, and if they’re destroyed they simply respawn for free in a few seconds. It's also a nice touch to generate resources for special abilities by taking the extra step of marking a target before destroying it – it's a good reward for a little bit of extra micro-management in small engagements. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Trebuchet answers the question of what would happen if GDI’s Mammoth Tank and StarCraft 2’s Siege Tank loved each other very much.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I couldn't help but applaud when the GDF posed and then answered the question of what would happen if GDI’s Mammoth Tank and StarCraft 2’s Siege Tank loved each other very much; that's some excellent wish fulfillment for fans of both those series. These Trebuchet hybrids deploy and un-deploy so quickly – in about a second – that it really drives home how micromanagement-heavy Tempest Rising is built to be. You don’t need to constantly flip back and forth between mobile and stationary modes, but you’ll get more firepower and range out of them if you do.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the opposing side, the Dynasty’s Scrap Truck is a wildly powerful unit that automatically repairs every vehicle or building in a radius while it’s stationary, and it can deploy to become a turret structure with an even bigger repair range. You can then use that to expand your base building area and stock it with flame and missile turrets (Dynasty can build a structure in advance and then instantly place it, while GDF places structures and then builds them), quickly creating a vehicle repair outpost with self-healing defenses right on the enemy’s doorstep. That, combined with their ultra-long-range Porcupine missile trucks and deadly SAM launchers, makes Dynasty a fantastic offensive turtling faction. And when you want to get a bit more aggressive, they can literally roll out a giant metal ball that flattens any tanks or infantry in its path if they can’t destroy it first.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Missions are a good time to smash through, but very few stand out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, the variety of missions once you get past the first few tutorials is respectable but expected, including a lot of base-cracking, defense holdouts and last stands, and commando missions led by powerful specialist infantry, and all of them come with optional objectives for you to cross off that might encourage replays. It's interesting that some of those objectives don’t even pop up unless you scout out the whole map – it's a reason to go back and replay, but if you're trying to do everything in one go it might be a little trollish. All of these missions are well done but again, quite conventional; there’s nothing here that thinks radically outside the box or effectively builds minigame modes around unit abilities the way StarCraft 2 did. They are a good time to smash through, but very few stand out.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dan's Favorite RTS Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like nearly every RTS campaign ever made, Tempest Rising gradually gives you access to new units and airstrike support abilities as you go, but here you also choose a new global upgrade every mission from one of three linear trees – plus you can unlock and then mix-and-match upgrades to fill an expanding number of slots. Some of the upgrades are minor but useful, such as adding burn damage over time to Dynasty’s flamethrowers or stat bonuses that start units out with a veterancy level. Some feel a little exploitative, like one that increases infantry vision range by 50% (which makes them incredibly effective spotters for artillery). A few, though, are meaningful choices that I’d definitely think hard about if I were to play through again on a higher difficulty. The biggest of these for me was the “Stolen Plans” abilities that let you build some of the opposing factions’ vehicles without having to capture their buildings. Some of those, like the Trebuchet tank and Porcupine missile launcher truck, are game-changers that helped me break through tough defensive lines quickly. It’s true that leaning on these can homogenize the campaigns a bit rather than emphasizing what makes each faction unique, but I appreciate being able to customize my force. Also, the ability to re-pack the Dynasty Scrap Truck after deploying it was a huge upgrade that saved me from having to build a whole fleet of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not spoiling anything that isn’t on the Steam page to say that late in both the campaigns, which follow the same events from opposite perspectives, the story abruptly introduces a third, technologically advanced faction tied to the glowing resource they’re all fighting over – which is a sentence I could’ve copied directly from the Wikipedia page of Command &amp; Conquer 3. The alien (ish?) Veti don’t have a playable campaign and aren't yet available in skirmish or multiplayer, so it's a bit tricky to understand how they work differently, but it’s good that they’re here for variety’s sake. Fighting their heavier armies isn’t dramatically different from taking on the GDF or Dynasty in the campaign – they have similar base and defense structures, tanks, aircraft, and infantry – but they do have a few terrifying late-game units that GDF and Dynasty can’t go toe-to-toe with and required me to take an entirely different posture when one showed up.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Tempest Rising’s two good-sized single-player campaigns are a large helping of comfort food for RTS fans old enough to remember Command &amp; Conquer in its heyday, and a way for everyone else to sample a classic style we don’t see very often anymore without having to deal with any creaky old technology. Its nature as an homage to those games does mean that it’s not terribly ambitious when it comes to doing anything bold you won’t have seen before, but it does put its own interesting spin on faction design that kept me experimenting with abilities throughout the campaigns and prevented it from feeling like too much of a retread. The main place it disappointed an old C&amp;C fan like myself was in its straight-faced mission briefings that can’t compare to the B-movie goofiness and memorable characters of the games that inspired it.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Amid all the new tricks and modes, Nintendo also confirmed a slew of new and returning tracks and racers for Mario Kart World.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the course side, there were several new courses shown off as part of the roamable world. From the streets of Crown City to the water of Salty Salty Speedway, there are plenty of places to explore and shortcuts to discover. Mechanics like wall-riding and grinding seem like they'll add quite a bit for players to uncover. Here's what we spotted in today's Direct.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mario Kart World Confirmed Courses Shown in Today's Direct</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Mario Bros.

Mario Kart World looks to be making some deep pulls from Mario's history. The usual suspects of Mario, Peach, Luigi, and Yoshi are joined by the likes of Spike, Conkdor, Penguin, and more. Here's everyone we spotted in a kart during today's Mario Kart World Direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World Confirmed Racers From Today's Direct</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Mario</li><li>Luigi</li><li>Peach</li><li>Daisy</li><li>Rosalina</li><li>Pauline</li><li>Yoshi</li><li>Toad</li><li>Koopa Troopa</li><li>Baby Mario</li><li>Baby Luigi</li><li>Baby Peach</li><li>Baby Daisy</li><li>Baby Rosalina</li><li>Wario</li><li>Waluigi</li><li>Bowser</li><li>Goomba</li><li>Spike</li><li>Cow</li><li>Lakitu</li><li>Toadette</li><li>Bowser Jr.</li><li>Birdo</li><li>King Boo</li><li>Shy Guy</li><li>Donkey Kong</li><li>Nabbit</li><li>Pirahna Plant</li><li>Hammer Bro</li><li>Monty Mole</li><li>Sidestepper</li><li>Cheep Cheep</li><li>Dry Bones</li><li>Wiggler</li><li>Cataquack</li><li>Pianta</li><li>Rocky Wrench</li><li>Conkdor</li><li>Chargin' Chuck</li><li>Penguin</li><li>Stingby</li><li>Swoop</li><li>Dolphin</li><li>Para-Biddybud</li><li>Pokey</li><li>Coin Coffer</li><li>Peepa</li><li>Snowman</li><li>Fish Bone</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">It's quite a line-up so far, and will probably only expand as we learn more about this game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-direct-everything-announced-for-the-switch-2-launch-title<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo shared with us a Mario Kart World Direct and it revealed much more about the launch title for the Nintendo Switch, including new details on characters, courses, races, secrets, and so much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This roundup has gathered everything you need to know about this Mario Kart World Direct and we hope it will help with the wait until this much-anticipated game launches alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Courses</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World will feature a ton of new and old courses on its interconnected map, and we were introduced to a few of them today, including Mario Bros. Circuit, Crown City, Salty Salty Speedway, Starview Peak, Boo Cinema, Toad's Factory, Peach Beach, and Wario Shipyard. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What should be most exciting for returning Mario Kart players is that the older courses have been "reimagined to feel at-home within this vast, new world, offering fresh experiences on classics." </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Characters and New Techniques</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering up to 24 racers can compete in one race, Mario Kart World will need a lot of characters to ensure everyone doesn't play the same one. While there are sure to be more added and revealed, this Direct featured such characters as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, Baby Peach, Baby Daisy, Baby Rosalina, Rosalina, Koopa, Rocky Wrench, Conkdor, Goomba, Spike, Cow, King Boo, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Waluigi, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Birdo, Bowser Jr., Lakitu, Toad, Wario, Pauline, Toadette, Shy Guy, Nabbit, Piranha Plant, Hammer Bro, Monty Mole, Dry Bones, Wiggler, Cataquack, Pianta, Sidestepper, and Cheep Cheep.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Driving with these characters will be even more fun this time around as there are new techniques to utilize. Charge Jump gives racers a chance to dodge enemy attacks, reach higher places and rails that can be grinded on, and even jump towards a wall to ride on it for a short time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most exciting new additions is Rewind, as it will let players try again to reach a hidden path or take a turn better or whatever! However, it is important to note that rivals will still move normally if you rewind so you could find yourself in even more trouble if you aren't careful.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Kart World Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Races - Grand Prix and Knockout Tour</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two main modes in Mario Kart World - Grand Prix and Knockout Tour. Grand Prix will be the mode fans are used to as players will need to compete in multiple races to win the Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup, Flower Cup, and more. However, this time around players will drive from course to course instead of exiting out to a menu, which should make for a much more seamless experience thanks to Mario Kart World's more open structure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you happen to conquer all of the Grand Prix Cups, a certain "colorful course" may appear which sure sounds like Rainbow Road. It won't be easy though, as there will be new obstacles like cars that shoot bullet bills and Hammer Bros. that throw their namesake hammers!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Knockout Tour is a battle-royale-esque mode where you have to race from one side of Mario Kart World's map to the other. The only catch is you have to be in a certain place at each checkpoint or you will be knocked out of the race. The winner will be the last driver standing in the Golden Rally, Ice Rally, and more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mario Kart World Free Roam</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In Mario Kart World's Free Roam mode, players will be able to drive wherever they'd like without the worry of trying to be in first place. As you explore, you will discover things like P Switches (hundreds of them!) that will activate blue coins you'll need to collect and start missions. These missions will be challenges that will improve your skills outside of races.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There will also be hidden coins like Peach Medallions, hidden panels, and much more. Oh, and there is a photo mode in Free Roam that will be available to always capture that perfect moment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Visiting Yoshi's restaurant will also be a joy as you can pick up "Dash Food" that will give you a boost of speed and an outfit inspired by your meal! Some examples shown were a cheeseburger, sushi, skewers, chips, roasted meat, pizza, ice cream, and more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Playing Mario Kart World with Friends</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing Mario Kart World with friends will undoubtedly be one of the best ways to play this racing game, and Nintendo is giving players a ton of options in how they can do that. Such options include having four players play on one system, local wireless play with up to eight players (two systems of four), and up to 24 players from around the world playing in Online Play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another big feature in Mario Kart World is allowing players to free roam with their friends in between races.
