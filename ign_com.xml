The public response seems to have been heard, and now WizKids is offering refunds to anyone who feels dissatisfied with their minifig boxes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As a company, WizKids seeks to create products that enhance and add to the enjoyment of game play," the company said <a href="https://wizkids.com/recent-announcements-2/baldurs-gate-3-character-boxed-set-update/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in an announcement</a>. "We want our customers to build long-lasting, fond memories around game nights with friends and family using our products.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Unfortunately, we missed the mark on this goal with the D&amp;D Icons of the Realms: Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 Character Boxed Set. If you purchased this set through our online stores, we will be offering a full refund to those who are unsatisfied with their set."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/pKkkroQrWt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/pKkkroQrWt</a></p>‚Äî Gale-LOD üòè (@HighLODLar) <a href="https://twitter.com/HighLODLar/status/1922382199300497566?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">WizKids went on to say it's aware of the reports, and its team is investigating the issues and taking action to both "make this right" and to ensure issues do not pop up again in future products.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The $49.99 pre-painted D&amp;D Icons of the Realms: Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 Character Boxed Set started rolling out to buyers last week, and the results surprised more than a few. Opening the box to strange paint jobs, off details, and a seemingly melting Withers <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-minis-from-wizkids-are-here-and-they-arent-leaving-the-best-impression">left purchasers feeling frustrated</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">WizKids is offering refunds through two options. If you bought the set online, you can contact customerservice@wizkids.com to start a request. If you went through a local retailer, you can return it at the point of purchase for a full refund. The company is also offering a product replacement through its <a href="https://win.wizkids.com/replacements/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replacement site</a>, where WizKids says it will work to provide a replacement that "meets the standards expected."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not exactly the happiest ending for those hoping for a nice new set of Baldur's Gate 3 miniatures, but it's at least something for those disappointed with the outcome of their box of minis. Hopefully those affected can find some other figure-makers to fill the miniature-shaped hole in their hearts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian just <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-notes-include-final-farewell-message-as-larian-looks-ahead">bid farewell to Baldur's Gate 3 with Patch 8</a>, its final major patch for its 2023 RPG that took the world by storm. The studio's CEO Swen Vincke has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-says-its-full-attention-is-on-its-next-game-media-blackout-for-the-foreseeable">dropped some hints about what's next for Larian</a>, but aside from it not being Baldur's Gate nor Dungeons &amp; Dragons, there's not too much more to go on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
