Game 6 (our next project) will happen the way it will happen thanks to you,‚Äù Jorjani said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That seemingly innocuous quote sparked concern from one fan who said it suggested Arrowhead was ‚Äúalready abandoning a good chunk of dev time and money from Helldivers 2.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jorjani quickly shut that down, insisting: "Nah. It's ALL Helldivers 2 for now. A very, very small team will spin up something later this year and go at it sloowly. Helldivers is our main focus and will be for a loooong time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, how long does Jorjani expect content updates for Helldivers 2 to last?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As long as you folks keep playing and buying Super Credits we can keep it going," Jorjani said, pointing to Helldivers 2's virtual currency that's used to buy Premium Warbonds. "Last summer we were kinda screwing the pooch so it looked like we wouldn't be able to keep the train going for a long time - but we turned the ship around, you support us a lot so it's looking bright."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here‚Äôs an interesting follow-up comment from Jorjani, in response to one fan who called on Arrowhead to make its next game available in all regions and avoid the region-locking purchase debacle the Sony-published Helldivers 2 has suffered from: "The next game is 100% funded by ourselves so we'll call 100% of those shots." That suggests Arrowhead isn't going with Sony or any other company for its next game, which in turn suggests it's not Helldivers 3.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Game 6 and how its development will (hopefully) differ from the "rough", eight-year slog that was Helldivers 2, Jorjani said Arrowhead wants to nail the "core s**t" early on before moving on to making the rest of the game this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For the most part of the development cycle games plain suck," Jorjani explained. "Very seldom are they truly fun from the get-go. And for Helldivers taking eight years to make it was rough for the longest time. But it came together in the end. The ONLY way to know is to playtest playtest playtest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For our next game we're doing things in a much smarter way and nailing a lot of the core s**t early on (as you should) then make the rest."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this tallies with previous comments from Arrowhead developers, who‚Äôve said they want Helldivers 2 to last for years to come. Let‚Äôs remember, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks"><u>Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time</u></a>, with an astonishing 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks. It is a record no first-party Sony-developed game will likely ever beat. But so much has happened since that initial explosive release: a dramatic U-turn on PSN account requirements on Steam, review-bomb campaigns, and a community often at war with Helldivers 2 itself as nerfs and buffs either go too far or not far enough. So you'd be forgiven for wondering whether enthusiasm for Helldivers 2 at Arrowhead might have waned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Alex Bolle, production director on Helldivers 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-wants-helldivers-2-to-be-around-for-years-and-years-and-years-to-come-and-what-about-a-warhammer-40000-collab">recently told IGN</a> ‚Äúwe want it to be around for years and years and years to come.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúHow do we stay true to the Helldivers 2 fantasy, challenging enough that we keep making amazing new features and new systems and all that while we stay true to who we are? And I think it's something that is so motivating for the years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúThe more we figure out how to thrive in a live environment, and we still have a way to go to figure out a lot of things around that, the more we can let creativity loose on new systems that we would've never thought about a year ago when we released. I've worked on live games before and it's where you feel like you have something you can figure out: what if I would do this cool thing I've seen in other games and adapt it to our sauce, that still makes it true to ourselves? I'm looking forward to this moment.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, recent leaks (one from PlayStation itself) <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-playstation-leak-suggests-players-will-fight-against-the-illuminate-on-super-earth-itself-next-week-and-now-gameplay-of-super-earth-mega-cities-has-leaked-too">point to the imminent release of Super Earth as a playable map</a>, as the Illuminate eventually make it to our home planet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-definitive-edition-release-sparks-backlash-with-disgruntled-fans-fearing-the-game-is-done-less-than-2-years-after-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. Games has announced and released Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition, which it described as "the most extensive version" of the gory fighting game. But for fans, the release of the Definitive Edition has sparked significant concern that NetherRealm has now moved on from the game, and that it won‚Äôt see any new DLC characters or significant content updates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition offers the main game packaged together with previously released downloadable content, including the Khaos Reigns story expansion, Kombat Pack 1, and Kombat Pack 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Definitive Edition also adds new character skins for Johnny Cage, Kitana, Scorpion, and Shao Khan ‚Äúinspired‚Äù by the upcoming Mortal Kombat 2 film, the Mortal Kombat (2021) movie character skin for Sub-Zero; and the tournament themed character skin (outfit) for Liu Kang.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For fans, The Definitive Edition feels like a line has been drawn under Mortal Kombat 1. While Warner Bros. is known for its definitive and ultimate editions, and indeed NetherRealm games tend to get them, this time there is a sense of finality to the release. And with no announcements forthcoming about a Kombat Pack 3 or anything else meaningful for Mortal Kombat 1, fans believe that March 2025's release of the T-1000 guest character will go down as the game's final content drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If true, it‚Äôs a big disappointment for hardcore Mortal Kombat 1 fans, who had hoped for significantly longer term support for the game. Indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago">many are now pointing to a September 2024 tweet from NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon</a>, who at the time moved to reassure fans already concerned that the studio had moved onto its next game by saying: ‚ÄúNetherRealm is still fully committed to supporting Mortal Kombat 1 for a long time to come.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The game is done, it‚Äôs their way of saying ‚ÄòGoodbye! Come back the next year or two for another overly priced game bloated with guest characters!‚Äô " <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1kmiyaw/the_game_just_fucking_came_out_dude_what_the_hell/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said a clearly disgruntled redditor</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúMK1 officially has a shorter content lifespan than the f***ing Texas Chainsaw Massacre game lmao,‚Äù said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, in July 2021, NetherRealm announced it had started work on its next project (Mortal Kombat 1) and, as a result, there would be no further DLC for Mortal Kombat 11. That announcement came two years and three months after the release of the game. NetherRealm is yet to make a similar announcement for Mortal Kombat 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-mortal-kombat-1-community-is-working-together-to-try-to-figure-out-how-to-fight-floyd-but-the-exact-process-remains-a-mystery-for-now">Mortal Kombat 1 enjoyed something of a resurgence in January with the secret fight with Floyd</a>, the pink ninja developer Ed Boon had been teasing for years. That sparked a fun community-wide effort that breathed new life into the game. But that was a rare bright spot for what has, overall, been a disappointing release for many core Mortal Kombat fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">T-1000 Terminator was the final DLC character added to Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian. Fans have wondered for some time now whether developer NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters, or a Kombat Pack 3, amid questions about Mortal Kombat 1‚Äôs sales success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated, however, that it still believes in the Mortal Kombat franchise. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady"><u>the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which is Mortal Kombat</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans of the studio‚Äôs work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, Injustice, although neither NetherRealm nor Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that. The first game in the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-gods-among-us"><u>Injustice: Gods Among Us</u></a>, launched in 2013, with its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-2"><u>Injustice 2</u></a>, coming out in 2017. NetherRealm released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-11"><u>Mortal Kombat 11</u></a> in 2019 and for a time it seemed like the studio would alternate between Mortal Kombat and Injustice games, but it went on to release another Mortal Kombat, the soft reboot that is Mortal Kombat 1, in 2023 instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-ed-boon-says-door-not-closed-on-injustice-3"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> in June 2023, Boon spoke in vague terms about this decision. "There were a number of factors, some of which I can talk about, some of which I probably shouldn't," Boon said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two reasons Boon was willing to discuss were the unfortunate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the team's choice to switch to a newer version of the Unreal game engine (Mortal Kombat 11 runs on Unreal Engine 3, whereas Mortal Kombat 1 runs on Unreal Engine 4).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But we did go to a new graphics engine, Unreal," Boon said. "We really wanted to be careful with COVID and all that stuff and everybody staying safe. So there were a bunch of variables involved that eventually we realized, 'Okay, let's do another Mortal Kombat game and hopefully we'll get back to the Injustice games.' "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to be sure, we wanted to confirm with him directly that the door was not closed on the Injustice franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not at all," Boon answered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat 1 has sold 5 million copies, with the franchise now up to 100 million. Mortal Kombat 11 became the best-selling game in the franchise by passing Mortal Kombat X's nearly 11 million units sold worldwide. By 2022, Mortal Kombat 11 had sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. Clearly, Mortal Kombat 1 has underperformed compared to previous games in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
