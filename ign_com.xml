The release of Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered earlier this year brought the first two games to a whole new generation of players. Amazon has now given the collection a solid 40% discount as part of this year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-2025-sale-top-deals-live"><u>Prime Day sales</u></a>, bringing the price down to $30.</p><p id="suikoden-i-ii-hd-remastered-switc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered (Switc">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered Drops to $30 </h2></p><div catalogid="d94d311e-99cf-4681-b5c7-61bda19cd0d6" id="224989"><div id="224989" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally released on the OG PlayStation, Suikoden I &amp; II set in place a number of mechanics and systems that became series staples, including the 108 characters that you can recruit, base building and management, a mix of more traditional turn-based encounters, and large-scale army skirmishes. IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/01/23/suikoden-2">review of the original Suikoden</a> doesn't hold back on praise, calling it "one of the best RPGs ever made." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Suikoden I follows the young son of the famed General Teo as he seeks out the 108 Stars of Destiny to bring about peace. Its follow-up takes place three years later, putting you in the shoes of the adopted son of the hero Genkaku as you once again have to recruit 108 more Stars of Destiny to stand against the invading Highland Kingdom. </p></div><div catalogid="d94d311e-99cf-4681-b5c7-61bda19cd0d6" id="224990"><div id="224990" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered (PS5)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These HD remasters include upgraded backgrounds, effects, and handy QOL features like auto-saves and fast forwarding in battles, both of which really make a difference. The 40% discount applies across the Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series versions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Suikoden and Suikoden II are notoriously expensive, so it's such a joy that we got this remaster after years of begging and pleading for it. For fans of turn-based RPGs who want to experience the classics, this deal makes it an easy recommendation. </p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">More Prime Day Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year's Prime Day sale features <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-deals-amazon-prime-day-2025">tons of discounts on physical games</a>.
