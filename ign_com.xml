Ed Annunziata — the original creator of the famed and fiendishly difficult action-adventure games — was interviewed about raising awareness of ocean conservation, his life as a developer, and, right at the end, he dropped his bombshell revelation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">California-based developer A&amp;R Atelier, at which Annunziata works, revealed in a press release that it is remastering Ecco the Dolphin and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ecco-the-tides-of-time"><u>Ecco: The Tides of Time</u></a>, as well as that all-important third game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It has been years in the making, and we’re honored to bring Ecco back,” Annunziata said (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/multiple-ecco-the-dolphin-games-officially-in-development" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Gematsu</u></a>). “Ecco has always been more than a game about a dolphin — he’s a bridge between worlds.” Sadly, that's essentially where the details stop, but the developer said to keep an eye on both its <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>website</u></a> and the official <a href="https://discord.gg/98P3J2SDt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Discord</u></a> for more information.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">10 (Unintentionally) Terrifying Games</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ecco the Dolphin originally launched in 1992 on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, and was followed by a sequel, Ecco: The Tides of Time, in 1994. Ecco Jr. and Ecco Jr. and the Great Ocean Treasure Hunt were released in 1995, although they were "edutainment" games and primarily developed as learning tools. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as the titular dolphin, your underwater world now devastated by a swirling gust of air and water. You must help him navigate back through treacherous tropical reefs and freezing polar ice floes to reunite him with his dolphin pod. There have been a few remasters since: we thought the 2000 remake was okay, writing: "Ecco the Dolphin is a classic from SEGA, but sometimes classics should stay in the past," and of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/17/ecco-the-dolphin-review">2007 remake,</a> we wrote: "For those who have played Ecco before, there's really no reason to come back to it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last Ecco the Dolphin game — ostensibly the "third" game, although Annunziata wasn't involved — fared much better, however, getting a 7.6 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ecco-the-dolphin-defender-of-the-future"><u>IGN's Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future review</u></a>. A further sequel, Ecco 2: Sentinels of the Universe, which had been written as a direct sequel to Defender of the Future, was cancelled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Fast-forward just a few short months later, however, and now the Bully online project is "shutting down forever."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bully was a humorous action game that put players in the role of high school outcast Jimmy while attending a pretentious private school. Fans have long called for a sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-rockstar-developers-share-details-on-the-development-of-the-cancelled-bully-2"><u>which was once in development at Rockstar’s New England studio in the late 2000s</u></a>, and while Bully 2 was obviously never released, some of its ideas made it into other Rockstar games like Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though the game was developed to be a single-player experience, the mod, which has been in development for years and fully released only last month, allowed players to team up for minigames, roleplay, compete in racing, and face off against NPCs, instantly drawing the attention of fans… and IP owner Rockstar, it seems.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Coming with sad news today," wrote one of the Fat Pigeon Development team on the project's Discord. "The Bully Online project is shutting down forever, which unfortunately means all the following is going to happen in 24 hours."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The post reported that the Bully Online server would shut down, development of Bully Online scripts would stop, the source code would disappear, and all webpages referencing it would be removed, along with the launcher (which has seemingly already happened). All Bully Online account data will also be "permanently deleted" and even Discord channels related to the mod are getting nuked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team held off on detailing why this was happening, only confirming that lead dev SWEGTA hopes to upload an explanatory video to his YouTube channel. "For now, though, know this was not something we wanted," the statement added.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar parent company Take-Two has a history of clamping down on fan projects, although after it acquired <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-officially-working-with-gta-roleplay-server-team-sparking-fresh-excitement-about-gta-6"><u>the modding team behind the wildly popular Grand Theft Auto 5 roleplay servers</u></a> FiveM and RedM back in 2023, it was felt a change in approach might have been in place. In fact, just yesterday (January 14), we reported that Rockstar had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-launches-official-user-generated-content-marketplace-for-mods"><u>even launched an official marketplace where creators can sell mods</u></a>... which could be the issue, as some players suggest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think we all know the reason, it's got everything to do with Rockstar's new CFX launch mod site where they make more greedy profit for [publisher] Take-Two Interactive by putting pay-walls on mods," <a href="https://x.com/VIK19941/status/2011511769433587753?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posited</u></a> one unhappy player. "I expect more mods to be shut down as the months go on with this new CFX marketplace."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, as this <a href="https://x.com/jordychinchin/status/2011561295838134277?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commenter</u></a> points out, Bully Online was already effectively paywalled to donors of the project, which is widely frowned upon across the modding space. "Not surprising at all," they said. "Dude was pretty much asking to get shutdown the moment he paywalled early access to this."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for if there'll ever be an official Bully 2? Dan Houser, Rockstar Games co-founder and the writer behind the studio's biggest games, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/grand-theft-auto"><u>Grand Theft Auto</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption"><u>Red Dead Redemption</u></a> series, recently sat down for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ign-in-conversation-with-dan-houser-at-la-comic-con-2025"><u>an exclusive interview with IGN</u></a>, revealing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-just-cant-do-all-the-projects-you-want-rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-says-bully-2-didnt-happen-due-to-bandwidth-issues"><u>Bully 2 didn't happen because of "bandwidth issues."</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
