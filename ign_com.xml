            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Frenetic, friendly fun.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of my favorite childhood memories come from playing co-op games with my friends over summer break. Now, as an adult, summers don't quite hit the same. Whether it's the weight of the world bearing down on me or the severe lack of couch co-op games, I'm not sure. But, every once in a while, a special game comes around that brings me back to that feeling of pure joy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Split Fiction, the follow-up from It Takes Two developer Hazelight Studios, launched earlier this year and features another amazing co-op adventure designed specifically for two players. Despite being only a few months old, the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game are already discounted to just $35 during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-2025-sale-top-deals-live">Prime Day</a>. Don't wait too long, though, as Prime Day ends tonight at midnight PT.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Split Fiction Drops to $35 on Amazon</h2><div catalogid="0dba8478-9b0f-4ee7-beef-cededf54465f" id="225069"><div id="225069" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Split Fiction (PS5)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-two-review">It Takes Two</a> is already one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-co-op-games">best cooperative games</a> of all-time, taking home <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2021-winners-revealed">top honors at the Game Awards in 2021</a>. Split Fiction is shaping up to be another instant classic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like its predecessor, Split Fiction is a split-screen experience designed for two players that can be played locally or online. It even includes a Friend Pass so you and a buddy only need to purchase a single copy in order to play together. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game features plenty of memorable moments and requires you to carefully coordinate with your partner to solve puzzles as you alternate between sci-fi and fantasy worlds. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">Our reviewer gave it a 9</a>, saying "Split Fiction is so good at wanting to be played it’s hard to <em>stop </em>playing. It simply doesn’t stay the same long enough for it to ever become boring." In fact, it's already on our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-video-games-of-2025-so-far">best games of 2025</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to save even more on PS5 games, we've rounded up the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-prime-day-ps5-games-on-sale-at-amazon">best Prime Day PS5 deals</a> available right now, so make sure to stock up before the sale is over.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Should I play It Takes Two first?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the similarities between the two games, Split Fiction is a completely new experience featuring a brand-new story and characters. So, if you never got around to It Takes Two, you don't have to worry about missing anything by jumping straight into Split Fiction. Although, there are quite a few nods and inside jokes for players who have played the previous game.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Shop the lowest prices this Prime Day</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matthew Adler has written for IGN since 2019 covering all things gaming, tech, tabletop games, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Whose turn is it?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has been one of the breakout hits of 2025. It's also a classically styled turn-based role-playing game, taking cues from many popular series, including Final Fantasy. These two factors have both led to many questions about whether Final Fantasy might return to its own roots, and now the question's been posed to one of Final Fantasy's front-facing leads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naoki Yoshida, the director/producer of Final Fantasy 14 and producer of Final Fantasy 16, was asked in an <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with AnimeNewsNetwork</a> whether mainline Final Fantasy games could go back to being turn-based, in the wake of Clair Obscur's success.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system," said Yoshida. "That doesn't take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game's systems around it. This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel. It's not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it's going to become more action-based.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[I'm] not necessarily going to be on Final Fantasy 17, so we also don't want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like 17 or even 18," Yoshida continued. "We don't want to put them on a rail."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The answer, essentially, is still up in the air. Final Fantasy changes with each entry, after all; aside from creating new stories and casts for each mainline numbered entry, each game can range from highly iterative to full-on evolutions or change-ups. Looking at the gameplay shifts from, say, Final Fantasy 9 on through 12 and 13 emphasizes how the series often shakes things up for each successive installment.</p><div id="best-mainline-final-fantasy-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3><h3>Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida has talked about this in the past, within the context of Final Fantasy 16 opting for a very action-oriented system. That <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/final-fantasy-16-ditched-turn-based-combat-to-appeal-to-younger-generations-producer-says/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entry tried to appeal to a different crowd</a>, because of the "expected" sales and impact of a mainline Final Fantasy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've had these conversations before, around the future of Final Fantasy, and will probably have them again. After all, simply judging by the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/everything-you-need-to-know-about-final-fantasy-xv-2">development timelines</a> of the past few mainline games, it might be a bit until we start hearing about Final Fantasy 17, much less 18 or beyond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and its development team at Sandfall Interactive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sells-33-million-in-33-days-not-bad-for-a-game-some-thought-was-going-to-get-crushed-by-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">have certainly struck success</a> by honing in on their goals and passions, so <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-reveals-what-he-wanted-to-say-at-the-game-awards-2023">maybe that is the true objective to strive towards</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-producer-naoki-yoshida-says-theres-not-a-clear-cut-answer-whether-future-entries-will-be-turn-based-following-clair-obscurs-success]]></content:encoded>
