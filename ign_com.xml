Especially when it comes to first-party Nintendo titles like Zelda and Mario, you often see games sticking with an above $40 price tag years and years after their release. That's why this deals season, the number one thing I had my eye on was price drops on Switch games, and for the first time (maybe ever), Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals have exceeded my expectations. While the Nintendo eShop has its own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-black-friday-digital-video-game-sale-live">digital game sale</a> underway, some of the best Switch games have their lowest prices ever at select retailers like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-black-friday-sales-2024">Best Buy</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamestop-black-friday-sale-2024">GameStop</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-target-black-friday-sales">Target</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-walmart-black-friday-deals-2024">Walmart</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With major price cuts to games that typically cost upwards of $50 (looking at you, Zelda), these <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cyber-monday-deals-2024">Cyber Monday deals</a> aren't getting any better. We’re here to help you find the best picks for Nintendo's handheld while holiday shopping on a budget.

Long answer: While major hardware discounts are rarely a sure thing on brand-new releases, Cyber Monday might bring some unexpected deals. In the announcement for Sony's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024">lineup of holiday deals</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-black-friday-2024-sale-predictions">PS5 Pro</a> was (unsurprisingly) nowhere to be found. However, some retailers could surprise shoppers with modest discounts or exclusive PS5 Pro bundles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-review">PS5 Slim</a>, for example, was released last year at a similar time and ended up getting a free game bundle (Spider-Man 2 or Modern Warfare 3) <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-the-ps5-slim-spider-man-2-and-call-of-duty-ps5-black-friday-bundles">at the end of November</a>.

With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> now here, there are plenty of discounts to explore. For example, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bgo2?object_uuid=b2079bf5-f109-4861-be4c-78e53621e28a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WD Black SN850X 2TB SSD</a> with a heatsink is currently available for $133.99, offering excellent value.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keep in mind that not all SSDs are compatible with the PS5. To ensure optimal performance, you'll need a PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 drive with a minimum read speed of 5,500MB/s to match the console's internal storage. To simplify your search, we've curated a list of SSDs that meet or exceed these requirements.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>PS Plus Cyber Monday Deal (Save 30%)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/20/54151004493-d618819f1a-k-1732112194364.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Save up to 30% on PS Plus during Black Friday 2024.

Frankly, if you see a game deal you like, we'd recommend hopping on it now. But if you missed out on the PS5 2K25 bundle (or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-black-friday-bundle-2024-new-live">any of the insanely popular Switch bundles</a>), there might still be hope come Cyber Monday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

In terms of video game deals, quite a few have caught our eye that have been brought over into the retailer's Cyber Monday sale, including an excellent discount on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aB1LZE?object_uuid=2b1cd6e2-864e-4a08-b68c-ca70a8b4fe28&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0C93LGYCN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1 for Switch</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch owners can enjoy a nice 63% discount on this collection, which has brought its price down to just $18.74. According to price tracker <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0C93LGYCN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">camelcamelcamel</a>, it's the lowest price its hit so far which is a massive bonus.

With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-the-first-preview">Metal Gear Solid Delta</a> hopefully dropping sometime soon, there's never been a better time to sneak back into this series of games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon's got even more gaming deals in its Cyber Monday sale that are worth adding to your virtual shopping cart.

Much like with Black Friday, Cyber Monday deals actually get released in two waves. The first wave happens today, Sunday, and primarily involves deals from brick &amp; mortar retailers like Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and Gamestop. The second wave happens on Monday and involves deals from online only retailers like Amazon, Alienware, HP, Lenovo, Newegg, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of deal quality, there are better-than-expected discounts on gaming consoles like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKDPXj?object_uuid=6b9b6161-a5e3-409f-9509-185486f8a8df&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXdPkB?object_uuid=6b9b6161-a5e3-409f-9509-185486f8a8df&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAVk5b?object_uuid=6b9b6161-a5e3-409f-9509-185486f8a8df&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Meta Quest </a>, and Steam Deck, several <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6bkeq?object_uuid=6b9b6161-a5e3-409f-9509-185486f8a8df&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apple iPads</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/92bR1e?object_uuid=6b9b6161-a5e3-409f-9509-185486f8a8df&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AirPods</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWdkPA?object_uuid=6b9b6161-a5e3-409f-9509-185486f8a8df&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apple Watches,</a> heavily discounted video games, powerful gaming PCs and laptops, and more.

Traditionally, Black Friday was known as the "retail holiday," where the best deals were found in-store, and Cyber Monday was known as the "online holiday," where the best deals were online only. Although today the lines are very much blurred, it is still true that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">many online only retailers still consider Cyber Monday the sale event of the year instead of Black Friday</a>. Expect some amazing sales to come out of online-only sites like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, Lenovo and several online-only deals from traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. In fact, Amazon has taken the preemptive and already switched over to Cyber Monday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
