Marvel video games, however, do not exist in the same universe, telling stories entirely separate and unrelated to each other. Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man games, for example, have nothing to do with Eidos-Montreal’s Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. Similarly, upcoming Marvel games such as Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, Marvel's Wolverine, and Marvel’s Blade, have no connective tissue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there was once an idea at Disney to create a Marvel Gaming Universe that would do for Marvel video games what the MCU went on to do for Marvel movies and TV shows. So what happened?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on <a href="https://youtu.be/_W6fCpdYs4Y?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Fourth Curtain podcast</a>, host Alexander Seropian and guest Alex Irvine recalled this MGU idea, which both worked on, and revealed why it fell by the wayside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seropian, perhaps best known as one of the founders of Halo and Destiny developer Bungie, went on to run Disney’s video game business before leaving in 2012. Irvine was the long-running writer of Marvel games, most recently working on the world-building, dialogue, and character backstories for smash hit Marvel Rivals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussing his prior work on Marvel games, Irvine discussed the scrapped MGU.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When I first started working on Marvel games, there was this idea that they were going to create a Marvel gaming universe that was going to exist in the same way that the MCU did,” Irvine said. “It never really happened.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seropian then explained that the MGU was his “initiative,” but it never got funded by the higher-ups at Disney.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When I was at Disney, that was my initiative, ‘Hey, let’s tie these games together.’ It was pre-MCU,” Seropian said. “But it didn’t get funded.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Irvine, who had worked on the iconic Halo alternate reality game (ARG) I Love Bees while at Bungie, went into some detail on how this MGU would have worked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That was so frustrating because we came up with all these great ideas about how to do it,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I was coming out of ARGs at that point and thinking, ‘Wouldn’t it be cool if we had some ARG aspects?’ There would be a place where players could go that all the games touched, and we could move them back and forth from game to game. We could link in comics, we could loop in anything, we could do original stuff. And then, as Alex said, it didn’t get funded. So we made a bunch of games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But why did the MGU fail to get the internal buy-in to move forward? Irvine suggested the idea became so complex it ended up putting some people at Disney off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Even back then, we were trying to figure out, ‘If there’s going to be this MGU, how is it different from the comics? How is it different from the movies? How are we going to decide if it stays consistent?’ And I think some of those questions got complex enough that there were people at Disney who didn’t really want to deal with them,” Irvine explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fun to imagine what might have been had the MGU idea got the funding it needed to become a reality. Perhaps if it had, Insomniac’s Spider-Man games would have existed in the same universe as Square Enix’s ill-fated Marvel's Avengers and Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, with characters from each game making cameo appearances across the titles or the stories all building towards some epic Endgame-style event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking ahead, there are questions over Insomniac's Marvel's Wolverine game. Will it be set within the same universe as Marvel's Spider-Man? Could Spider-Man or any other character from those games end up making a cameo in Wolverine in some way?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, the MGU goes down as yet another scrapped video game idea. Although, perhaps in another universe somewhere, it is a reality…</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-update-050-adds-crossplay-across-all-platforms-blueprint-upgrading-photo-mode-and-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> has a big new update that adds crossplay across all platforms among many other new features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Update v0.5.0 also lets players store Pal data in the Global Palbox and transfer Pals between worlds. A new storage system has 10 times the capacity of the regular Palbox. Not only can guild members access it, but it can be used as a personal storage with private settings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, you can now change your character’s appearance without affecting armor stats (transmog), there’s a photo mode, blueprint upgrading, and dedicated servers for Mac, among other changes detailed in the patch notes below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Pocketpair said it’s working on adding dedicated servers for the PlayStation 5 version and will release them at some point in the future.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld has had an incredible <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-hits-32-million-players-during-year-1-as-nintendo-pokmon-lawsuit-looms-over-the-horizon"><u>32 million players</u></a> since its early access launch in January 2024. The studio has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-crossplay-final-boss-and-more-coming-as-pocketpair-reveals-2025-roadmap"><u>laid out a content roadmap for Palworld's 2025</u></a> that looks fairly lengthy; alongside crossplay, there is an "ending scenario" and more new content on the way for the hugely popular creature-catching survival game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC a year ago, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-massive-profits-are-too-big-for-a-studio-with-our-size-to-handle"><u>couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated</u></a>. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>signing a deal with Sony</u></a> to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP, and launching the game on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looming over all this is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-officially-suing-palworld-developer-over-multiple-patent-infringements"><u>a lawsuit from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company</u></a>, who seek "an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages" on the grounds that Palworld has allegedly infringed on "multiple" patent rights. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-reveals-patents-at-the-heart-of-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-lawsuit-and-how-much-money-its-being-sued-for"><u>Pocketpair has provided an update</u></a>, identifying the patents the studio is allegedly infringing, and it has since tweaked how players summon Pals in Palworld, apparently in response. Pocketpair has vowed to take on Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in court, saying: “We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Palworld update 0.5.0 patch notes:</h2><div data-cy="paragraph"><p><strong>▼New Content</strong><br>・Crossplay!<br>⤷ Cross-play is now available across all platforms.</p><p>・Global Palbox<br>⤷ Store Pal data in the Global Palbox and transfer Pals between worlds!</p><p>・Dimensional Pal Storage<br> ⤷ A new storage system with 10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox!
