            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Riot‚Äôs free-to-download League of Legends fighting game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/2xko">2XKO</a> is out now in early access, and the launch has brought with it various bundles, including one based on much-loved animation Arcane that costs a whopping $100.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans who want the Arcane skins for Vi, Jinx, and Ekko must buy the $100 Ultra Starter Edition. There is no way to buy the skins for each character individually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bundle includes the aforementioned Arcane skins, all Arcane skin chromas, an Arcane sticker set, 5,000 KO points (the in-game currency), plus everything in the cheaper Deluxe and Standard bundles. As you'd expect, all the contents amounts to more than $100 in terms of the individual value of what's included here, but that hasn‚Äôt stopped some fans from reacting with a mix of disbelief and frustration at the way Riot is handling microtransactions so early in the game‚Äôs life.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">2XKO is free-to-play, so fans expected somewhat aggressive monetization. But forcing players to buy the $100 bundle to get <em>any</em> of the Arcane skins rather than selling them standalone has drawn criticism. A cursory glance at the 2XKO subreddit, social media, and Discord shows the vociferous debate this bundle has sparked into life. ‚ÄúNo separate buy? I only play vi,‚Äù <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1o0jaj3/100_bucks_for_the_3_arcane_skins_is_crazy_really/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complained VaninaG</a>. ‚ÄúLike the value of the bundle is not bad, is like buying a game+season pass, but if there's no separate buy for the skins it's kinda predatory because some might just want to spend 10-20 in one skin.‚Äù</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="tl" dir="ltr"><p>wait wait wait wait wait.

It makes sense that Riot would want to lean on the Netflix animation, its characters and their designs for 2XKO‚Äôs launch. And the developer has raised eyebrows for its monetization for its other games, including League of Legends, in the past, so for some this approach for 2XKO comes as no surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Riot isn‚Äôt alone in employing these sorts of tactics when it comes to selling virtual video game items. Whether it‚Äôs forcing players to buy bundles instead of standalone items, selling bundles of virtual currency that always leave you with a little bit left over so you‚Äôre encouraged to spend more, or FOMO-inducing battle passes and in-game shops that make items available for a limited period only, gamers have become accustomed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-fans-blast-cardboard-isaac-clarkes-absurd-35-pricetag-in-free-to-play-skate">expensive cosmetics that are often pricier than entire games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question for Riot is whether 2XKO‚Äôs launch monetization does the business. Complaints from the vocal hardcore online probably won‚Äôt move the internal needle if the masses open their wallets. But some are already comparing 2XKO to Warner Bros.' failed free-to-download fighting game MultiVersus, which similarly drew controversy for the way it sold virtual items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN‚Äôs <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2xko-review">2XKO early access review</a> returned an 8/10.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/little-nightmares-3-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/little-nightmares-3-review.1319737/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of us have recurring nightmares from time to time, whether it‚Äôs the one where you go to school naked, or the one where all your teeth fall out, or indeed the one where you go to school naked and all your teeth fall out. However, Little Nightmares 3 isn‚Äôt the kind of recurring nightmare that‚Äôs likely to keep you awake at night. Instead, this puzzle-platforming sequel feels like a surprisingly uninspired retread of the two shadow-soaked stories that preceded it, and its only noteworthy new addition, a co-op mode, doesn‚Äôt shake up the formula to any substantial degree. I went into Little Nightmares 3 steeling myself for a traumatic twilight trip scary enough to make me sit bolt upright in bed, but instead it left me feeling calm enough to roll over and hit the snooze button.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Little Nightmares 3‚Äôs journey through a sequence of dimly lit domains focuses on two entirely new and aptly named child leads, Low and Alone. You select which pint-sized protagonist you want to inhabit at the story‚Äôs outset, with the second hero controlled either by the AI ‚Äì like Six was in Little Nightmares 2 ‚Äì or by a second player in online co-op. The two leads share the same core abilities like jumping, crouch-walking, and grabbing objects, but they‚Äôre each equipped with a unique tool for puzzle-solving and the occasional brief burst of combat. Low has a bow that can be used to shoot ropes to drop crates or switches to move platforms, while Alone lugs around a giant wrench that she can use to smash through weakened walls or manipulate the controls of certain basic bits of machinery found in Little Nightmare 3‚Äôs twisted terrain. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However there‚Äôs little room for experimentation with either character‚Äôs unique action, since they are largely context sensitive ‚Äì Low will typically only raise his bow to fire if there‚Äôs a target nearby that he needs to hit, for example ‚Äì and puzzle solutions always seem pretty obvious as a result. Few of them require much in the way of coordinated combinations of the two characters‚Äô abilities, and I never found myself getting hung up on a brainteaser in Little Nightmares 3 for anywhere near as long as I did when faced with some of the more challenging puzzles of its predecessor, which made it feel like I was just mindlessly going through the motions for most of the five-hour journey.      </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Little Nightmares 3 Review Screens</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Nightmare Run</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the tales of the first two Little Nightmares‚Äô which each featured five chapters, Low and Alone‚Äôs story is split across only four: the sandswept sprawl of Necropolis; the creepy, lollipop-lined floors of the Candy Factory; the twisted, Tim Burton-esque big tops of Carnavale; and the somewhat generic hospital hallway horrors of The Institute. (There are apparently a further two chapters to come, but they will arrive at a later date as part of a paid expansion pass.) Low and Alone travel to each standalone setting using mirrors as portals, and while I won‚Äôt spoil why it is they‚Äôre trapped in these nightmare realms or exactly where they‚Äôre trying to get to, I will say that I found the unspoken bond that gradually develops between them to be surprisingly sweet, even if the story itself is ultimately pretty slight and not nearly as spooky as the previous two.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the four chapters on offer, Carnavale struck me as the most engaging to explore. There are all sorts of disgusting sights to sneak past in its dank depths lit by string lights and occasional flashes of lightning, from grotesquely overstuffed patrons smacking human pinatas with sticks and gorging themselves face down in straining slop buckets, to a particularly disturbing spin on the classic magician‚Äôs trick of sawing a man in half. It also features the most tense combat encounters in the entire adventure, as the diminutive duo is forced to team up against waves of wooden dolls styled like sideshow alley barkers, with Low knocking their heads off with a well-timed arrow and then frantically trying to avoid the clutches of their headless bodies, while Alone rushes in to club their discarded skulls with her wrench to terminate them for good.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Little Nightmares 3 is less of a frightening new beast and more of a familiar Frankenstein's monster assembled with parts repurposed from the previous two games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond this handful of memorable moments, though, Little Nightmares 3 is less of a frightening new beast and more of a familiar Frankenstein's monster assembled with parts repurposed from the previous two games. The towering baby doll that looms large in the background of the Necropolis chapter like some sort of slack-eyed Stay Puft Marshmallow Man is certainly an intimidating sight to behold, but overcoming it is painfully straightforward ‚Äì you simply need to time your movements to slink past it when its vision cone shifts like so many other stalkers in the series‚Äô past. Remember timing your jumps in tandem on top of a trap door to crash your way down through to basement levels in Little Nightmares 2? Well, get ready to repeat that action several times over in Little Nightmares 3, along with regular stops to slowly rip the wooden beams off boarded-up doorways and push and pull crates in order to clamber up onto shelves. It all starts to feel a bit too repetitive long before you roll credits, which isn‚Äôt ideal for a story with a runtime so short it can be completed in a single late night session.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Umbrella Cooperation</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a couple of additional tools that Low and Alone gain access to along the way that switch things up slightly. For the first two chapters, the plucky young pair is equipped with umbrellas that can be unfurled to either take advantage of updrafts and float up to out of reach platforms, or to cushion the fall from equally great heights, which adds a welcome wrinkle to the story‚Äôs otherwise strictly linear exploration. However, any interesting movement methods these parasols present are completely quashed at the story‚Äôs midpoint, when the umbrella is ditched in favour of a flashlight that has considerably less impact on the action. Sure, it illuminates your increasingly gloomy surroundings, but there‚Äôs never a time where it‚Äôs used as a tool for heightening the tension in any interesting ways. I still get chills thinking about that sequence in Little Nightmares 2 that involved desperately shining a flashlight to halt the march of prosthetically-limbed patients in its menacing hospital setting, but sadly there‚Äôs nothing nearly as terrifying as that here.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, Little Nightmares 3 quickly settles into a fairly predictable rhythm of alternating between slow and steady stealth sections and urgent chase sequences, both plagued by instant fail outcomes that are at least mitigated somewhat by mostly generous checkpointing. Zero-tolerance terminations are nothing new in the series, of course - however, these swift deaths did highlight the occasionally idiotic behaviour of the partner AI this time around, like when an CPU-controlled Low kept shooting arrows as the same giant fly in the Necropolis that would fall and crush him, sending us back to the nearest checkpoint. For several frustrating repeated deaths, it proved to be a literal game-breaking bug.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">AI issues can be avoided by playing through Little Nightmares 3 in co-op, of course, but although this new two-player mode has been touted as one of its most distinguishing features, it‚Äôs been implemented in a disappointingly limited fashion. For starters, co-op is online-only so you can‚Äôt play through the story with a friend on the couch beside you, which is a shame if, like me, you enjoy partnering up in games with your spouse or children. It also isn‚Äôt drop-in, drop-out, so if you start a game in co-op but your fellow adventurer decides they‚Äôre too creeped out to continue, you have to start the story over again in order to play solo, which seems like an entirely unnecessary restriction to impose.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Awesome Couch Co-Op Games</h3><p>Sofa, so good.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Little Nightmares 3 does however offer a generous friend pass system similar to that of Split Fiction, allowing a second player to join you without them having to purchase their own copy of the game, but that‚Äôs pretty much where the comparisons with Hazelight Studios‚Äô co-op epic end. Little Nightmares 3 can‚Äôt compete with Split Fiction‚Äôs consistently innovative brilliance in co-operative game design, nor the replay value it offers by featuring such widely contrasting experiences between its two playable characters. After finishing the campaign as Low, I immediately started again as Alone and was disappointed to find there was no meaningful difference between the two beyond one character‚Äôs ability to hit things and the other's ability to shoot them.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Despite a pair of new protagonists and the inclusion of two-player support for the first time in the series, Little Nightmares 3 doesn‚Äôt do enough to distinguish itself from the previous two adventures, making each step through its shadowy structures less full of dread and more like a retread. There are some memorably morbid moments here and there, and the Carnavale chapter is a standout, but the constant crate-pushing and instant-fail chase sequences feel all too familiar at this point. Little Nightmares 3 features little innovation, few scares, and limited appeal if you‚Äôve already played the previous two games, unless you‚Äôre dead keen to experience the series‚Äô signature brand of stop-start stealth with a friend in tow. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/little-nightmares-3-review]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yooka-replaylee-review.1319731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite all of their outdated issues, I have a soft spot for 3D platformers that makes itself known whenever something like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review"><u>Super Mario Odyssey</u></a> finds a clever way to breathe new life back into the genre. Yooka-Replaylee, which remixes a platformer that was already soggy with nostalgia, doesn‚Äôt get anywhere near that bar, but it does at least succeed in making the cute-but-forgettable adventure of 2017‚Äôs Yooka-Laylee into something more competent. My biggest gripes with the original, including camera issues, sloppy controls, and a lack of fast travel, have all been addressed, with lots of fat and ideas that didn‚Äôt work being thrown out as well. But there‚Äôs also an odd Frankenstein quality to this reworked creation, a surprising number of technical shortcomings, and the same unrelenting focus on nostalgia for the 3D platformers of yesteryear that results in almost nothing unique or novel. There are still good times to be had with this charming lizard/bird duo, but the reconfigured experiment that serves as their latest adventure only succeeds at turning a game that never quite worked into something a little less underwhelming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More than the simple remaster its cheeky title might imply, Yooka-Replaylee is a complete overhaul that fixes a pretty large number of missteps, but it‚Äôs still a 3D platforming collectathon at its heart. It wears its on-the-nose Banjo-Kazooie inspirations on its sleeve, so you‚Äôll be hopping, gliding, and rolling around colorful worlds while chatting with dorky, googly-eyed characters as you hunt for the all-important ‚ÄúPagies‚Äù required to unlock the next area. Fortunately, now you can do all that sans the absolutely atrocious camera and imprecise controls of the original, which is quite nice, and everything from the quests you‚Äôll tackle to the story to even things as fundamental as the number of Pagies you‚Äôre collecting has been completely redesigned, to its benefit more often than not.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Yooka-Replaylee Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you‚Äôre solving basic jumping puzzles, fighting goofy looking monsters, or playing minigames like a gem-grabbing minecart ride, Yooka-Replaylee never gets any more challenging than requiring the rare second attempt. Combat in particular is as straightforward as can be, as it usually amounts to just spamming the tailspin attack until everything dies, and enemies are absolutely rubbish at being able to land hits on you. The improved controls and camera also mean the extreme simplicity of its platforming has become more glaring, and most puzzles can be solved just by knowing the basic bag of movement tricks in your belt. That could be springboarding off of Yooka‚Äôs tail for increased jumping height or learning that you can eat certain objects to augment your powers, like red orbs that give Yooka the ability to spit fire and melt things. It‚Äôs extremely basic stuff, and while it all plays much better without as much wonkiness, it‚Äôs just not that exciting to begin with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, a lot of work has clearly been put into making this version feel much better, as Yooka-Laylee‚Äôs awkward camera angles and slippery movement used to be near-constant annoyances. Probably the best compliment I can give is that I almost never thought about the camera while playing, because it was never really an issue. Of course, I‚Äôd occasionally get stuck in some weird corner or whatever and momentarily have to swing the camera around, but with controls that feel quite smooth, it never caused me much trouble as I hopped around hungrily gobbling up Pagies. I never raged during the rare instances where I failed a platforming attempt, either, since I only had myself to blame for any muck ups this time around.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fresh paint doesn‚Äôt solve the underlying problem that this all feels generic.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But tighter controls do nothing to address Yooka-Replaylee‚Äôs biggest issue: the original was already an unambitious throwback that played on your love of old school 3D platformers instead of trying to push that mold or do something interesting within it. Yooka-Replaylee is quite literally a remake of a game that was itself already a remix of old ideas, and a fresh coat of paint doesn‚Äôt solve the underlying problem of this all feeling generic and unsurprising. The fact that it‚Äôs coming out an additional eight years later certainly doesn‚Äôt help with that either, as we‚Äôve had even more time to outgrow these dated designs as standouts like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">Astro Bot</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> explored the genre in more exciting ways. Even when I was impressed by just how much they improved here, I still struggled to find a reason to recommend this to anyone when they could just play Astro Bot instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs exactly the same, and one of the more fundamental changes is the overall pace of the adventure. Instead of unlocking abilities as you go by collecting a special currency in each area, you get all of those abilities right away and then learn to take advantage of them as they come up during platforming puzzles. Similarly, rather than unlocking different sections of each of the five main levels in phases, you have access to their full maps right from the get-go and can even fast travel to different points to minimize monotonous backtracking, which is awesome. And instead of 25 somewhat sparse Pagies to find in each level, this number has been doubled to 50, so you get to watch Yooka and Laylee delightfully freak out about finding one twice as often. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these tweaks combine to make everything about Yooka-Replaylee feel faster and less linear. Instead of seeing a Pagie out of reach and knowing you‚Äôll have to return to get it once you‚Äôve unlocked a certain ability you don‚Äôt yet have, you can more or less sprint through each zone grabbing everything in sight until you‚Äôve utterly cleared it. Even cooler: you‚Äôre given a map with a checklist of all the Pagies in each world, so you can scratch your completionist itch without wandering around for hours in search of something that‚Äôs alluding you ‚Äì unless that thing is a Pagie <em>piece</em>, which they don‚Äôt show you on the map for some frustratingly inconsistent reason, so you could spend three hours searching for the last one on a level like I <em>definitely didn‚Äôt do</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Removing these artificial barriers to progress is without question a good decision, and it was quite freeing to be let loose in each world to methodically solve every puzzle and combat encounter in my path, but there are some pretty weird side effects of making so many overhauls as well. The most wonky example stems from the increased number of Pagies, which completely alters the flow of the adventure in some pretty unappealing ways. If the original Yooka-Laylee was explicitly designed around the 3D platforming philosophy of classic games like Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie, where collectibles were harder to get but more meaningful, then Yooka-Replaylee has been adapted to be more like Super Mario Odyssey, where you‚Äôre picking up items left and right. The problem is that some remain hidden behind legacy designs that ask you to win a minigame or beat a boss, while you‚Äôll find others just lying around in easily reachable places or crammed into spots that don‚Äôt feel like a terribly natural fit. On the bright side, you get the dopamine hit of finding collectibles twice as often, but it feels pretty odd when some take significantly more effort than others, which serves as a fairly obvious reminder of just how much this thing has been altered.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Unexpected side effects of its Frankenstein construction are all over the place.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The most extreme instance of this tweak going awry is the fact that, after doing a completionist run of the first two worlds, I realized I had gathered enough Pagies to just‚Ä¶ go finish the story? That‚Äôs right ‚Äì I still only needed 120 of these guys to head to the big baddie‚Äôs lair and trigger the final boss fight, and since that‚Äôs a lot easier now than it once was, I walked right into his home and rolled credits before even entering the other three stages. I‚Äôm not sure if this was an intentional decision to give players more freedom to approach the adventure how they want, but it just felt downright weird to do, especially since some of the cutscenes along the way still reference events that are supposed to take place in the worlds I skipped. For this reason, I was actually able to roll credits after just four hours, then went back and spent another seven on the other levels in the most anti-climactic way possible, completely removing any urgency to be a completionist with the remaining worlds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The unexpected side effects of this heavily revised collectathon‚Äôs Frankenstein construction are all over the place. For example, in the original you had lots of reasons to talk to fun side characters like Trowzer the snake, who had a chance to show off his amusing personality as he sold you all of your platforming abilities. But since you get access to those abilities right at the start now, Trowzer has been relegated to an entirely optional vendor you only have a reason to chat with maybe once per stage, leaving him devoid of most of the silly bits and one-liners he previously delivered. Another example of this is one of the villains, Dr. Quack, who used to goof around with you as he forced you to take his annoying quizzes throughout the story. These have been removed completely, which I‚Äôm certainly not crying about as these sections were never much fun, but it also means you don‚Äôt really get to build a relationship with this guy and lose a lot of the heart that was previously one of Yooka-Laylee‚Äôs strengths.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite 3D Platformers</h3><p>Do you like jumping? Then I recommend hopping on these games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Don‚Äôt get me wrong: I still think the vast majority of these changes are a step in the right direction, even when they introduce some jankiness or come at the cost of some jokes getting dropped. It‚Äôs just abundantly clear how much this thing has been tortured to correct for errors of the past, to the point where it almost feels like it would have been a better idea to just make a new game altogether. The story in particular feels like a casualty to all the revisions, since you speak to characters far less and spend a whole lot less time understanding the bad guys and their motivations, so it almost feels like you‚Äôre required to have played Yooka-Laylee (and remember enough of it) to understand this remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you do or not, it‚Äôs at least easy to appreciate just how good Yooka-Replaylee looks. The visual improvement over the original is absolutely massive. Everything is more colorful, lighting has been fixed so you never feel like you‚Äôre wandering through the dark, and Yooka and friends are more expressive. Plus, you can enjoy how pretty it all looks with a whole bunch of neat cosmetics to swag up your heroes as you explore. Unfortunately, this glow-up is offset by the fact that I encountered numerous technical shortcomings, from abrupt crashes to framerates absolutely tanking during boss fights or other unfortunate moments. Crashes were fairly rare, and unlike with Yooka-Laylee, I never fell through the map or got caught on the environment, but the framerate dips were worse than anything I encountered in the original, and happened often enough to leave me pretty irritated.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Yooka-Replaylee aims to overhaul a platformer that was rife with frustrating issues, and while it does feel better for it, none of its changes do enough to bring it close to the 3D platforming standards of today. Improvements to the movement of both your camera and character, the upgraded graphics, and the removal of unnecessary annoyances like having to unlock abilities over time are all fantastic changes. But all of the bending that was done to modernize this thing has resulted in an almost equal number of drawbacks, like a story that has been unsatisfyingly chopped up and a search for Pagies that feels a bit too easy given how many are now crammed into each area. So unless your nostalgia for this kind of 3D platformer is particularly strong, there aren‚Äôt a ton of compelling reasons to revisit this one.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/yooka-replaylee-review]]></content:encoded>
