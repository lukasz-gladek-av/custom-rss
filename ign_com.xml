Embracer said Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 did particularly well on Steam, where it saw over 250,000 peak concurrent players. For context, the first Kingdom Come: Deliverance hit a peak Steam concurrent player count of 96,069 seven years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s actual peak concurrent player count will be bigger, given the game launched on console as well as PC. However, neither Sony nor Microsoft make player numbers public.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer, which owns Warhorse Studios via its subsidiary, Plaion, said Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 “has been initially successful, not only in terms of player and critic reception, but also in terms of performance.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This reflects the dedication and hard work of our development studio, Warhorse Studios, and our publisher, Deep Silver,” Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is our strong belief that the game will continue to generate substantial revenues over the coming years, highlighting the exceptional quality, immersion and appeal of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. Warhorse Studios has a robust roadmap, including updates and new content over the next 12 months, ensuring an engaging and continuously evolving experience for the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are immensely proud of the teams involved in the successful release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, which has significantly outperformed our expectations so far,” Wingefors added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other than Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Embracer has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</a> due out later this quarter (January to March 2025). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer said it has more than 5,000 game developers working on its upcoming games, with 10 triple-A games due out over the next three financial years (FY 2025/26, FY 2026/27, and FY 2027/28). Eight of these are from internal studios, two from external studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In FY 2025/26, Embracer has two triple-A games scheduled to be released towards the end of the financial year. Mid-size releases include Gothic 1 Remake, REANIMAL, Fellowship, Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, Titan Quest II, Screamer, Echoes of the End (working title), Tides of Tomorrow, Satisfactory (console) and the full release of Wreckfest 2, alongside a similar number of mid-sized games yet to be announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer has endured a tough time in recent years, laying off thousands of staff and selling a number of its studios, including Borderlands maker Gearbox and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 developer Saber Interactive. It still owns Metro developer 4A Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metro-developer-makes-clear-playstation-vr2-game-awakening-isnt-next-mainline-metro-game"><u>which is working on a brand new game in the series</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting started in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?

While the teaser shown during yesterday's Sony's State of Play 2025 gave fans a glimpse of an Ape Escape monkey in the jungle wilds of Snake Eater on PlayStation 5 and PC, fitting neatly with the PS2 original, Xbox Series X and S players will take on a different threat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although we've yet to see any in-game footage, Konami's Xbox teaser, below, closes not with Snake vs. Monkey but Snake vs Bomberman. Yes. Really.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The original mode unlocked two items for Snake that carried over into the main game: first-view-perspective Monkey Mask and his Banana Camouflage, which made even rotten food edible. Right now it's unclear if Bomberman will give Xbox players the same advantages, or something entirely different. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Metal Gear Solid Delta seems more like a very shiny HD remaster than the elegant remake it could have been," IGN said in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-the-first-preview"><u>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater preview</u></a>, which reflects on Snake's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-deltas-modern-camera-made-the-game-so-easy-konami-bumped-up-the-difficulty"><u>new first-person perspective</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s an admittedly beautiful nostalgia trip, but almost faithful to a fault."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out IGN's round-up of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced"><u>everything announced at State of Play 2025</u></a> for more on what's coming to PlayStation 5 in the years ahead, including details of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saros-is-housemarques-successor-to-returnal-arriving-in-2026"><u>Housemarque’s Saros</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/days-gone-remastered"><u>Days Gone Remastered</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

But the company stressed that sales of all PS5s now brought its latest console in-line with its projected 18 million sales by the end of March 2025, and just 1.5 million units behind predecessor PS4, which had sold 76.5 million units at the same point in its production cycle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monthly active users across its service are also up to 129 million, up 5% year-on-year and marking a new milestone, with overall sales of games and consoles also up by 16%. 42% of PS5 sales were to new PlayStation Network users. Sony's big release during the quarter was Astro Bot, which has sold 1.5 million copies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With "significant increases" reported during its games and network services segment for the quarter, Sony raised its profit forecast by 2%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony did not comment on its wide-reaching outage last week, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-psn-down-february-2025"><u>took its PlayStation Network service offline for almost a full day</u></a>.

But where does that leave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Rockstar parent company Take-Two <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">reiterated GTA 6’s fall 2025 release window</a>, but now we know Borderlands 4 is out in September, there’s no chance GTA 6 will be out the same month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So when? October? November? December 2025? All seem up for grabs now for GTA 6. The risk of course is that Take-Two ends up cannibalizing its big 2025 games by releasing them too close together. And let’s not forget <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-compare-mafia-the-old-country-to-gta-6-dev-says-theyre-not-as-similar-as-youd-think">Mafia: The Old Country launches at some point summer 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Take-Two’s big games, and by that we really mean GTA 6, end up doing more harm to each other than good by releasing too close to each other? That’s a question we put to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick in an interview ahead of the company's third quarter financial results. As you’d expect, Zelnick said Take-Two is planning its releases to avoid a risk of cannibalization, insisting the timing is driven by a desire to “respect the consumer's need to spend a lot of time playing these hit games before they go on to the next.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No, I think we will plan the releases so as not to have that be a problem,” Zelnick said. “And what we found is when you're giving consumers hits, they tend to be interested in pursuing other hits. In other words, I've said this many times, even when the hits aren't ours, they're a good thing for the industry. In this case, we hope that the hits will largely be ours. So we feel really good about it and I think that we will time our releases so as to respect the consumer's need to spend a lot of time playing these hit games before they go on to the next.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the context of Borderlands 4’s just-announced September release date, when might GTA 6 come out? If Take-Two wants Borderlands 4 fans to spent “a lot of time” playing before moving on to, say, GTA 6, how long is a lot of time? One month? Two months? Three?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid all this speculation is of course the prospect that GTA 6 will be delayed either into early winter, or at some point in the first quarter of 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look, there's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things," Zelnick responded when IGN asked how confident he was that Rockstar would hit fall 2025 for GTA 6. "So we feel really good about it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Borderlands 4, Zelnick insisted the brand remains “really strong” despite the disastrous <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/borderlands-the-movie">Borderlands movie</a>, which bombed at the box office and was mauled by critics and fans alike. In fact, Zelnick said that the movie’s failure won’t impact the potential success of Borderlands 4 at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's no secret that the movie was a disappointment, but interestingly, it really benefited our catalog sales,” Zelnick explained. “So actually the effect was quite positive. It would've assumed been more positive if the movie had been better received. But the brand is really strong. We feel great about Borderlands 4.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
