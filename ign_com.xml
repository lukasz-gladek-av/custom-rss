Fans know next to nothing about this project, but according to <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/troy-baker-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, Troy Baker has signed on to appear in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In a heartbeat I would always work with Troy,” Druckmann is quoted as saying in the article. Baker famously played Joel in The Last of Us Parts 1 and 2 for Naughty Dog and has worked closely with Druckmann for years.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/25/gettyimages-1455443700-1732545103522.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Troy Baker.

At the time, the studio said it would have needed to put all its resources into post-launch content for years to come, and that approach would have severely impacted its ability to develop future single-player games. Naughty Dog then went on to confirm that it had more than one ambitious brand new single-player game in the works, without revealing anything about them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In June, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-as-it-works-on-multiple-single-player-projects-neil-druckmann-says">Druckmann said Naughty Dog was looking to break away from being predominantly associated with The Last of Us</a>. "I promise you, we will not be The Last of Us studio forever," Druckmann insisted, speaking of Naughty Dog's beloved post-apocalyptic franchise that debuted in 2013 and received its Part 2 sequel in 2020. The studio is otherwise best known for creating the Uncharted franchise, though this was put to bed with 2016's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review"><u>Uncharted 4: A Thief's End</u></a> and smaller follow-up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-review"><u>The Lost Legacy</u></a> a year later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Baker is set to star as Indiana Jones for MachineGames’ Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. Then, he will appear in Ken Levine’ Judas, having played Bioshock: Infinite protagonist Booker DeWitt. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/max-reveals-new-release-date-details-for-the-last-of-us-season-2-and-peacemaker-season-2">Season 2 of HBO's hit TV show The Last of Us</a> comes out spring 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sniper-elite-resistance-doubles-down-on-the-saboteur-sandbox-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Developer Rebellion gives the series' secondary hero a shot at the big time in this new operation set in Nazi-occupied France.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As the Sniper Elite series has dived further into its World War II setting, it's embraced more of a Hitman-esque sandbox approach to stealth-action gameplay, getting players in the shoes of a saboteur aiming to cripple the Nazi empire from the inside. But what the series still excels at is capturing the suspense and rush of carefully sneaking behind enemy lines to land that one critical shot against an unsuspecting Nazi scumbag – and showing you the bloody results with the classic X-ray kill cam. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Sniper Elite: Resistance, developer Rebellion continues Sniper Elite 5's open-ended approach to sneaking into enemy territory and smashing Nazis in gory, schlocky fashion, and this time it gives the series' secondary protagonist their time in the spotlight. Just ahead of its January launch, we played over an hour of a mission focusing on destroying a German super train and sneaking through a hotel in search of valuable intel – all of which showcased what Sniper Elite does best.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sniper Elite: Resistance - November 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In parallel to the events of Sniper Elite 5, Resistance focuses on the exploits of British commando Harry Hawker. Returning players will recognize Harry as one of the second playable characters in the series' co-op campaigns alongside Karl Fairburne, so think of Resistance as an opportunity to see what he was up to while Karl was flying solo in the fifth game. The main story of Resistance focuses on Harry weakening the empire's influence and helping the French resistance gain the upper hand – all while channeling some strong Jason Statham energy as he does it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sniper Elite 5 saw a steady release of DLC missions that saw Karl Fairburne invade secret weapons facilities hidden in France, but the developers saw an opportunity to create a new campaign within the occupied country that told a different story, which led to the decision to create an entirely new game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We felt that there was much more to explore in the French theater for the war, and we ended up making basically a full fledged campaign from what we wanted to do," said Shaw. "It was just better for players if we could release one big game rather than lots of little updates like for Sniper Elite 5."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like Sniper Elite 5, Resistance is a stealth-action game where you carefully maneuver through dense levels packed with Nazi guards, outposts, and other encampments filled with supplies and valuable intel. Along with your reliable long-range sniper rifle, which includes different ammo types to mask sound and amplify damage, you also have a pair of binoculars to scout ahead and mark targets. Harry also possesses secondary weapons and gear to distract enemies and sabotage structures.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Resistance continues with that Hitman-style approach to taking out key targets and objectives with direct action or some off-the-wall problem-solving. There's that familiar thrill being able to quietly whittle down enemy presence with stealth kills and distracting guards with bottles to sneak through well-guarded areas. While the quiet approach is often the best way to make it through, Harry can still hold his own when all hell breaks loose – yet you're better off keeping a low profile, as Harry can be quickly taken out if peppered with enough bullets. Generally, the enemy AI is competent and kept me on my toes. However, there were some odd moments where I felt their behavior was a bit off when ignoring obvious signs of sabotage or having some weird instances of the enemies not being able to maneuver through areas as well as you'd think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was an area that fans responded to well with Sniper Elite 5, and the developers wanted to lean further into that open ended experience. According to Shaw, the levels of Sniper Elite: Resistance was designed to allow for multiple playstyles from players.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Resistance continues with that Hitman-style approach to taking out key targets and objectives with direct action or some off-the-wall problem-solving.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"What Sniper Elite does well is give players a lot of different tools and avenues to tackle any situation as they please," said Shaw. "As we see it internally, we allow players to observe first, examining their points of interests and enemies in the area, and try to figure out ways in which they might want to move through the level and complete the  objective. We want to make sure players can get high up to get those sniping shots in there, but also allow for players to stick to the stealth side of things completely – we try to cater as many play styles as we can."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What impressed me the most about this particular mission was how dense and multilayered the level design was. This level featured an impressive amount of verticality and different pathways to reach my goal of getting to the city's main hotel-turned-Nazi-command-base. In one ill-fated attempt, I tried a stealthy direct approach across a fortified bridge, but that quickly went south after getting spotted. In another go, I went to the opposite side and found my way to a train yard where one of the side objectives was to destroy a train. Along the way, I was whittling down targets and taking out high-profile marks to score extra experience.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The standout moment in the mission was reaching the hotel, which had multiple points of entry and hidden pathways into locked rooms by climbing on the side of the building. This was my favorite section of the mission, and it was satisfying to escape from the zipline above and down into the streets below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From what I played, Sniper Elite: Resistance largely sticks to the same formula as Sniper Elite 5, featuring the familiar loop and objectives that fans are accustomed to. It's not quite aiming to be a massive leap forward, but rather doubles down on Sniper Elite 5's open-ended stealth-action gameplay. One new feature that I didn't get to dive into was the new propaganda missions, which the developers state are hidden within each stage and unlock micro-missions where you take control of other members of the resistance, showcasing their stories and particular objectives.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sniper Elite: Resistance Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With a campaign aiming for a similar length to the Sniper Elite 5, Resistance works as a worthy companion to the previous game, but also seems like a compelling entry point for newcomers to the series. So far, Sniper Elite: Resistance maintains that familiar yet still satisfying action of being an assassin in an open world where you smash fascists and liberate towns from the Nazi scourge – and yes, it'll never get old seeing those kill cams in action.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-player-hits-level-cap-before-the-opening-credits<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One dedicated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> player has hit the level cap before beginning The Heist mission, meaning before the opening credits have rolled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1gyno8j/level_50_before_the_heist_that_took_so_damn_long/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uO__Ou</a> shared their self-inflicted challenge, noting that it "took so damn long" while confirming a playtime of 40 hours and 30 minutes. Game tracking website <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/2127" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Long to Beat</a> pegs Cyberpunk 2077's entire main story at around 25 hours and 30 minutes in total, meaning the player spent more time in the opening area than it would take to actually complete the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077 opens with a handful of smaller missions before the crux of the story kicks off with The Heist. Per open-world game standards, it also limits players to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/Watson">the opening area of Watson</a> during this time, meaning just a fraction of the game's total activities (that award experience points) are available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">uO__Ou overcame this somewhat by using an exploit that allowed them to leave Watson. This doesn't activate the dozens of side quests or other open-world activities available in Cyberpunk 2077's Night City, but does offer better grinding locations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Go to Pacifica, Batty's Hotel for, in my experience, the best farming spot," uO__Ou said. "Repeat it over and over and over. Took me 40 hrs but, to be honest, if I did this more efficiently, it can take less than 35 hours. Just don't forget to sleep every hour for an experience boost and to use different weapons for your sanity and for skill progression."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077 uses a similar progression system to the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review">The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim</a>, where players can engage in different activities to level up specific skills which contribute to the overall level. Being stealthy and getting headshots, for example, upgrades the Headhunter skill, while crafting items upgrades the Engineer skill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">uO__Ou used these different skills to eventually reach the final Level 50, though it could have almost certainly been reached faster by actually progressing the main story. With developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-rules-out-cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch">CD Projekt Red now done with Cyberpunk 2077</a> and its expansion <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review">Phantom Liberty,</a> and focusing on a sequel codenamed Orion (and upcoming The Witcher games codenamed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-polaris-development-cd-projekt">Polaris</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-spin-off-project-sirius-has-a-new-framework-following-development-restart">Sirius</a>), however, fans are having to come up with quirky challenges like these to keep themselves entertained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Practically nothing is known about Orion so far, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-hires-veterans-from-mortal-kombat-diablo-control-and-more">CD Projekt Red is still in the process of creating a North American studio in Boston</a> to develop it. It has been called a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077 though, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2-may-have-grander-branching-storylines-based-on-players-starting-life-path">may feature more involved life paths</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-review">In our 9/10 review of Cyberpunk</a>, IGN said: "Cyberpunk 2077 throws you into a beautiful, dense cityscape and offers a staggering amount of flexibility in how you choose to take it from there."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
