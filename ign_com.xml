Alongside its planned Title Updates, director Yuya Tokuda has confirmed a few additional goals the team has, as post-launch support for the latest entry in the Monter Hunter franchise carries on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/topics/director-letter/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter from the director</a>, Tokuda started by laying out the roadmap <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-everything-announced-for-title-update-1">seen in the recent Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase for Title Update 1</a> and beyond. The first big Title Update drops on April 4, this Friday. Then, the seasonal event Festival of Accord: Blossomdance runs from April 23 through May 7. Additionally, April 30 through May 21 will see the Arch-tempered Rey Dau storm into Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of May, Update Ver. 1.011 will bring an unannounced Capcom collaboration and some "other additional features." Title Update 2 is then planned for this summer, with a new additional monster and seosonal event. Tokuda confirms more free updates are arriving beyond that.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">A greater challenge awaits</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of the Mosnter Hunter Wilds' director's letter dug into the question of challenging monster content. Already, fights like Tempered Arkveld, the aforementioned Arch-tempered Rey Dau, and a refight with Zoh Shia are confirmed. Tokuda also confirmed Mizutsune, arriving with Title Update 1, will have an 8-star Tempered Mizutsune fight, available at HR 41 or higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end-of-May update will add even more 8-star Tempered monsters to the Wilds. Tempered versions of Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad will make their way to the game in this update.</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"Each of these monsters have had various behind-the-scenes adjustments to make them more resilient, such as increased health, resistance to wounding, and tweaks to multiplayer scaling," Tokuda said. "Challenging monsters will also appear in future updates, so keep an eye out for further information about them."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Balancing it all out</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically addressing feedback from launch, Tokuda said that Capcom is planning to make "various adjustments," including weapon balance changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These will be implemented gradually with each upcoming title update in order to make the game more enjoyable for everyone for a longer period of time," Tokuda said. "Depending on the content, these changes may take some time to prepare."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The director noted the Hammer as one weapon being considered for "upward adjustments," which sounds like good news for Hammer mains. Some "unintentionally overpowered" things will be adjusted down — the Corrupted Mantle is one example — but Capcom said it plans on adjusting other parts upward, making for a "generally balanced" update. The team is currently aiming to implement the overall weapon balance adjustments in either the end-of-May update or in Title Update 2 this summer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Performance adjustments</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Capcom is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-director-commits-to-addressing-stability-issues-with-pc-improvements-coming-in-title-update-1">targeting stability and performance for Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, specifically noting the PC version. Title Update 1 is planned to bring a reduction in VRAM usage and an upgrade to the DirectStorage version of the Steam version, which should result in an "overall improvement" of stability for PC players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More improvements are planned, to bolster the overall technical experience for players on all platforms. Additionally, the in-game economy, balance, and other areas are planned for improvement too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Quality-of-life is also a major target for the Monster Hunter Wilds team moving forward. The Grand Hub, arriving in Title Update 1, is part of this, condensing various functions into one end-game area. The team has also reduced waiting times for facility functions at each location.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team is continuing to work on UI/UX improvements and other quality-of-life updates too. A few items on the docket include restocking items, checking skill information, engaging in multiplayer quests, using the Seikret, and camera behavior during hunts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rollout stars with Title Update 1 this Friday, April 4, and on into the summer as we approach Title Update 2. Though it's still fresh, Monster Hunter Wilds is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-breezes-past-10-million-sold-capcom-explains-why-its-done-so-incredibly-well">already one of the year's most popular games</a>, and it doesn't look like Capcom is planning to slow down its roadmap for it anytime soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/runescape-dragonwilds-announced-as-jagexs-new-take-on-the-open-world-survival-genre<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Jagex has announced that it's bringing the world of RuneScape into a new genre: survival. The developer revealed RuneScape: Dragonwilds, a cooperative open world survival game coming to early access this spring.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragonwilds takes place in Ashenfall, a new continent within the RuneScape universe, where one to four players can work together to learn new skills, build camps, grow stronger, and survive against powerful enemies, including lots and lots of dragons. Ashenfall has two regions, with five unique biomes, and the potential for more to be added later post-launch. Though Ashenfall is not the same continent most of RuneScape proper takes place on, RuneScape fans will find a lot of familiarity in the world, including some locations that may resemble familiar places from RuneScape itself, like a wizard's tower, or a certain castle...</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">RuneScape: Dragonwilds First Look Screenshots and Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Monsters may also look familiar, but come with a twist. While you'll still see rats, dragons, trolls, cows, and other creatures you'll recall from RuneScape, Ashenfall's wild magic has warped these creatures into strange, nature-fied versions of themselves with new appearances and fusions with plants, thorns, and other wild bits.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Core to survival in Dragonwilds is development of skills, and yes, they include classic RuneScape activities like cooking and woodcutting. These skills allow you to interact with the world in various ways - when I saw a few clips of the game at the Game Developers' Conference earlier this month, I was shown clips of a player using wind runes to gain the ability to glide through the air across distances. Even more nostalgic was a woodcutting skill that allows players to line up a row of trees and throw a spectral axe to chop them all down at once. It's a move I was told was referred to as "ax-tral projection." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">RuneScape: Dragonwilds is entering early access on PC sometime this spring, with hopes for a wider launch (including console) sometime in 2026. Jagex will host a deep-dive reveal of the game on Twitch on April 15 at 9:00 AM PT.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

One year removed from the infamous in-game liberation of Malevelon Creek, Helldivers 2 is sending its players back to the planet to hold it against surging Automaton forces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a recent Major Order failure, players were worried about a return to the Creek, as reports indicated the Automatons — pushing forward with their fiery new Incineration Corps — were targeting the Severin Sector. The sector, and Malevelon Creek in particular, was the center of one of Helldivers 2's earliest and most notable collective moments in the game. Helldivers converged on the planet to try and keep the Creek under Super Earth control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The combination of jungle terrain and extremely dangerous foes led to Malevelon Creek being dubbed things like "Robot Vietnam." After the fight concluded and the Creek was securely under Helldiver control, Arrowhead released a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-gives-all-players-a-special-commemorative-cape-for-malevelon-creek-memorial-day">special cape to commemorate the fight</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, over the weekend, a new Major Order confirmed Helldivers <em>will</em> be heading back to Malevelon Creek. The offensive, led by the Incineration Corps, is on its way, with Malevelon Creek as the target. Already, invasions and skirmishes are underway across the sector, with lines pushing towards the Creek.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through the in-game briefing, Super Earth is urging its Helldivers to protect the resting place of many "Creekers" who fell in the push to free the planet. This is all to prevent the "greatest net desecration" of the upcoming Malevelon Creek Memorial Day.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Helldivers Alerts (@HelldiversAlert) <a href="https://twitter.com/HelldiversAlert/status/1906316365507748312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 players are, predictably, amped for this Major Order.

Those who experienced the Creek back then, with its swarms of bots and lasers filling the air, are geared up for round two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New players who joined after the original fight for the Creek <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1jnguoi/wake_the_f_up_helldiver_we_got_a_creek_to_liberate/mkn0lse/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also seem eager</a> to jump in and experience this particularly memorable locale. There's a lot to be said for these communal efforts, where Helldivers start logging on and building towards big moments together. When it ties into the long-running story and a feeling of a shared experience in a universe, it can be really incredible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, concerns are already rising that Arrowhead hasn't fully tipped its hand yet. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1jnz8re/this_mo_is_going_well_too_well/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One post notes</a> that while the defensive efforts are going well and Malevelon Creek is currently safe, there are still five days left on the Major Order.

It's fascinating to see it unfold in real-time, and will no doubt make this week an exciting one for Helldivers players as the war for the Creek picks up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-is-having-its-halo-moment-with-the-dark-ages</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-is-having-its-halo-moment-with-the-dark-ages.1149975/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-is-having-its-halo-moment-with-the-dark-ages<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The last thing I expected Doom: The Dark Ages to remind me of was Halo 3. And yet, half way through a recent hands-on demo with id Software’s gothic prequel, I was mounted on the back of a cyborg dragon and unleashing a salvo of machinegun fire across the side of a demonic battle barge. With the vessel’s defensive turrets destroyed, I landed my beast atop the ship and proceeded to charge through its lower decks, turning the entire crew into a few gallons of red slop. Seconds later, the warmachine was toast and I burst through its hull, leaping onto my dragon to continue my crusade against the machines of Hell. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those familiar with Bungie’s landmark Xbox 360 shooter will instantly recognise the shape of Master Chief’s assault on the Covenant’s scarab tanks. The helicopter-like Hornet may have been swapped for a holographic-winged dragon and the giant laser-firing mech for an occult flying boat, but the core of the experience is all here: an aerial assault that transitions into a devastating boarding action. Surprisingly, this wasn’t the only moment in the demo that reminded me of Halo. While the combat core of The Dark Ages is unmistakably and singularly Doom, the campaign’s design seems to have a very “late-2000s shooter” spin thanks to its love of elaborate cutscenes and a greater push for gameplay novelty.    </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/28/doom-the-dark-ages-dragon-1743152759607.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A dragon assault on Hell's battle barge. | Image credit: id Software / Bethesda</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Across two and a half hours I played four levels of Doom: The Dark Ages. Only the first of them, the campaign’s opener, resembled the tightly paced, immaculately mapped design of Doom (2016) and its sequel. The others saw me piloting a colossal mech, flying the aforementioned dragon, and exploring a wide-open battlefield dotted with secrets and powerful minibosses. It’s a big departure from Doom’s usual pursuit of mechanical purity, instead feeling akin to the likes of Halo, Call of Duty, and – weirdly – old James Bond games like Nightfire, all of which thrive on scripted setpieces and novelty mechanics that guest star for a mission or two. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a fascinating direction for Doom to head in, because once upon a time the series made something of a U-turn away from this. The cancelled Doom 4 was set to resemble Call of Duty, not only due to its modern military aesthetic but also thanks to an increased emphasis on characters, cinematic storytelling, and scripted events. After years of work id Software concluded that such ideas simply weren’t a good fit for the series, scrapping them in favour of the much more focused Doom (2016). And yet, in 2025, here they are in The Dark Ages. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The campaign’s rapid pace is punctuated with new gameplay ideas that are reminiscent of Call of Duty’s biggest novelties.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo opened on a long and elaborate cutscene, (re)introducing the realm of Argent D'Nur, the opulent Maykrs, and the Night Sentinels – the knightly brothers-in-arms of the Doom Slayer. The big guy himself is depicted as a terrifying legend; a nuclear-level threat on two legs. While all of this lore will be familiar to Doom obsessives who poured over the prior games’ codex entries, the deeply cinematic approach with which it’s now presented feels very new. Very different. Very Halo. That continues into the levels themselves, with NPC Night Sentinels scattered about the environment akin to UNSC Marines. While they don’t fight alongside you (at least not in the levels I demoed) there’s certainly a greater sense that you’re part of an army – like Master Chief, you’re the invincible spearhead of a large force. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot of character work in the introductory cutscene and it remains to be seen if this is something Doom really needs. I’m a big fan of the prior games’ slight approach to story, and part of me would rather The Dark Ages continued to tell the Slayer’s tale through environment design and codex entries, reserving cinematics only for the big reveals à la Eternal. But while I have my reservations, the cutscenes thankfully know their place: they tee up a mission and are never seen again, refusing to interrupt Doom’s signature intense flow. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are interruptions in other forms, though. After that opening mission, which starts with pure shotgun slaughter and ends with you parrying Hell Knights using the Slayer’s incredible new shield, I was thrown into the cockpit of a Pacific Rim-like Atlan mech and asked to wrestle demonic kaiju. After that, I was soaring through the skies on that cybernetic dragon, taking down battle barges and picking off gun emplacements. These tightly scripted levels create a significant gear shift, punctuating the campaign’s rapid pace with new gameplay ideas that are reminiscent of Call of Duty’s biggest novelties, such as Modern Warfare’s AC-130 gunship sequence or Infinite Warfare’s dogfighting missions. The Atlan is slow and heavy, and the skyscraper-high perspective makes Hell’s armies look like Warhammer miniatures. The dragon, meanwhile, is fast and agile, and the shift to a wide-angle third-person camera results in a very different experience that feels a dimension away from classic Doom. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/28/doom-the-dark-ages-mech-1743152796190.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The mech battles are Pacific Rim-scale punch ups. | Image credit: id Software / Bethesda</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the best FPS campaigns thrive on this kind of variety. Half-Life 2 and Titanfall 2 are the gold standard for it. Halo has endured so long partly because its mix of vehicular and on-foot sequences provides it with a rich texture. But I’m unsure if this will work for Doom. As with Eternal, The Dark Ages is once again a wonderfully complex shooter to play – every second demands your complete attention as you weave together shots, shield tosses, parries, and brutal melee combos. In comparison, the mech and dragon sequences feel anemic, stripped back, and practically on-rails – their combat engagements so tightly controlled they almost resemble QTEs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Call of Duty the switch to driving a tank or firing from a circling gunship works because the mechanical complexity of such scripted sequences isn’t that far removed from the on-foot missions. But in The Dark Ages there’s a clear gulf between gameplay styles, so much so it’s akin to a middle school guitar student playing alongside Eddie Van Halen. And while I know Doom’s core combat will always be the star, when I’m beating the snot out of a giant demon with a rocket-powered mech punch I shouldn’t be wishing I was back on the ground using a “mere” double-barrelled shotgun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My final hour of play saw The Dark Ages shift into another unusual guise, but one built on what feels like a much sturdier foundation. “Siege” is a level that returns its focus to id’s best-in-class gunplay, but it opens up Doom’s typically claustrophobic level design into a huge open battlefield, its geography shifting between narrow and wide to provide a myriad of pathways and combat arenas. The goal, to destroy five Gore Portals, has the same energy as Call of Duty’s multi-objective, complete-in-any-order missions, but I was reminded once more of Halo – the grand scale of this map versus the tighter routes of the opening level evokes the contrast between Halo’s interior and exterior environments. And, like Halo, the novelty here is that the excellent core shooter systems are given new context in much larger spaces. You must rethink the effective range of every single weapon in your arsenal. Your charge attack is employed to close football field-length distances. And the shield is used to deflect artillery fired from oversized tank cannons. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Were these ideas always a bad idea for Doom, or were they just a bad idea when they looked too much like Call of Duty?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The downside of expanding Doom’s playspace is that things can become a little unfocused – I found myself backtracking and looping through empty pathways, which really does kill the pace. It’s here I’d like to have seen The Dark Ages veer even closer to Halo by throwing the dragon into the mix and using it like a Banshee; being able to fly across this battlefield, raining down fire before divebombing into a miniboss battle, would have helped maintain the pace and make the dragon feel more integral to the experience. If such a level exists beyond what I’ve seen, I’ll be very happy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of the overall shape of the full campaign, though, I am fascinated that so much of what I’ve seen feels like a resurrection and reinterpretation of ideas that were once considered an ill-fit for the series. Very little of the cancelled Doom 4 was released for the public to see, but a <a href="https://kotaku.com/five-years-and-nothing-to-show-how-doom-4-got-off-trac-468097062" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotaku report</a> from 2013 paints a distinct picture. “There were a lot of scripted set pieces,” a source told the publication, among them allegedly an “obligatory vehicle scene.” And that’s exactly what we’ve got in the Atlan and dragon sections – mechanically simple scripted sequences that hark back to the novelty vehicle levels of Xbox 360-era shooters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://youtu.be/PS6SBnccxMA?t=812" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talking to Noclip</a> in 2016, id Software’s Marty Stratton confirmed that Doom 4 “was much closer to something like [Call of Duty]. A lot more cinematic, a lot more story to it. A lot more characters around you that you are with throughout the course of the gameplay.” All that was scrapped, and so it’s genuinely fascinating to see so much of it return in The Dark Ages. This is a campaign set to feature big boarding action setpieces, lusciously rendered cinematics, a much wider cast of characters, and huge lore reveals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is: were those ideas always a bad idea for Doom, or were they just a bad idea when they looked too much like Call of Duty? Part of me is just as skeptical as the fans who once decried “Call of Doom”, but I’m also excited at the idea of id Software finally making that approach work by grafting it on to the now-proven modern Doom formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The beating, gory heart of The Dark Ages unquestionably remains its on-foot, gun-in-hand combat. Nothing in this demo suggested that it will not be centre stage, and everything I played affirms it's another fantastic reinvention of Doom’s core. I think that alone is strong enough to support an entire campaign, but id Software obviously has other designs. I’m surprised that a couple of the studio’s new ideas feel so mechanically slim, and I am concerned that they will feel more like contaminants than fresh air. But there’s still a lot more to see, and only in time will these fractured demo missions be contextualised. And so I eagerly await May 15th, not just to return to id’s unrivaled gunplay, but to satisfy my curiosity. Is Doom: The Dark Ages a good late-2000s FPS campaign or a messy one? </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
