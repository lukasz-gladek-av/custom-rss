            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Final Fantasy VII is getting a makeover on Steam. No, not the remake. I mean the actual, original game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/39140/view/514107648813039662" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Announced last month</a> and released today, this updated version of Final Fantasy VII comes with a handful of new features as seen on the storefront. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3837340/view/498346952550779352" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to an official post</a>, this new version of the old game will include a 3x speed mode, the ability to turn off random encounters, a "battle enhancement" mode that will max out Limit gauge and let players recover HP/MP during battles, and an autosave feature.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The new version of the game will replace the 2013 edition on the Steam store, and the 2013 edition will no longer be available to buy. However, those who already own the 2013 version will receive the new version free of charge, <em>and</em> will still have access to the 2013 version in their libraries simultaneously with this new version. Critically, though, save files are not compatible between the two versions, so you will have to start a new game to enjoy the re-release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This update effectively brings the game up to parity with the other modern console ports of Final Fantasy 7. For years, the 2013 edition on Steam had been behind the times, effectively just an old (and often buggy) PC port.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's still worth checking out the original Final Fantasy VII if you missed it back in the day, or even if you just want a walk down memory lane ahead of the conclusion to the Final Fantasy VII Remake Trilogy. It's been teased that we're getting "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-will-share-more-updates-than-ever-before-on-final-fantasy-7-remake-project-this-year-says-director">more updates than ever before</a>" on the trilogy this year, leading fans to hope that the announcement of Part 3 is imminent. Meanwhile, Part 2, Rebirth, is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-and-xbox-this-year">coming to Switch 2 and Xbox later this year</a>. FF7 for everyone!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?
