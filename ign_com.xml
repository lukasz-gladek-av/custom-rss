            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The alleged risk of using a well-known <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> exploit is causing widespread confusion among the game's community, fuelled by a dire warning from a senior player that supposedly originates from the app's own development team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Said warning states that Pokémon Go's developers are aware of the exploit in question — which allows users to interact with in-game locations from further away than normally possible — and consider it "a violation of the Terms of Service of the game." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Continued use of the exploit is detectable by the developer's anti-cheat teams, the warning goes on to claim, and risks users' accounts being flagged for cheating — an offense that can eventually result in a permanent account ban. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The appearance of this message, and the claim it is being passed on from Pokémon Go's makers, has sparked a firestorm of debate, primarily over the rights and (mostly) wrongs of this exploit being viewed as cheating in the same vein as more nefarious tactics. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many players have said that this "trick" simply makes use of a unintended bug in how the game functions, and is not comparable to the tools some players use to actively break the game, such as by using third-party apps and hacks to spoof their location.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a debate over the veracity of the message itself — both over its origins, which appear to be from a senior player marked as a Community Ambassador who has spoken to the game's developers, and over the likely intent behind what was said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To understand the nuances here, it's worth taking a look at the issue in more detail. At a base level, the exploit allows players to access a raid lobby slightly beyond their normal interaction radius via a Daily or Premium Raid Pass, rather than by using a more expensive Remote Raid Pass. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Performing the exploit — referred to locally among players as "flying," "floating," or "tricking" — is clearly not intended behavior, but can hardly be considered game-breaking. Accessing a raid lobby that's less than 100m away but slightly out of your normal range is considered by many players to simply be a convenience — and potentially an aid to taking part in more raids overall, even if this is done so without the top-tier Remote Raid Pass. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, a simple glance at the game's Terms of Service (TOS) shows that, according to the letter of the law, this could indeed fall under the game's description of cheating as it stands. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN contacted the Pokémon Go development team to ask about the origins of the warning, whether the exploit was indeed considered cheating, and what actions players might expect if they continued to use it. In response, a spokesperson pointed us back to the game's <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/terms" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOS document</a>, and specifically its section on cheating, which we'll quote below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, it's entirely possible to see how this exploit <em>could </em>fall under the TOS' definition of using "techniques to alter or falsify a device's location" and therefore — again, according to the letter of the law — is something that <em>could </em>be considered cheating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But by pointing IGN back to its TOS, the Pokémon Go development team is also — deliberately or not — highlighting something potentially crucial around this issue's enforcement. And that's the fact that, once again, according to the letter of the law, playing with multiple accounts is <em>also </em>considered cheating — despite it being something that a percentage of the game's playerbase does, with absolutely zero infraction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What this may all ultimately boil down to is someone purportedly asking the Pokémon Go development team for its view on an issue that the game's makers would obviously never sanction, but which seems unlikely to suddenly result in waves of players being banned. And yet, because of the murky origins of the warning, and because nuance can be difficult when messages get passed over the internet, players have now been left aggrieved and concerned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will the exploit stick around in the game forever? It seems unlikely. Will players suddenly find themselves banned for using it while it's still possible? This seems unlikely too. But, we should state, this is just one reading of the situation, in lieu of any formal statement being provided — something which, if formalised, would likely only prompt the need for actual enforecement, which the majority of players seem to be against.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Movie</a>, now appears to have taken over as the video game voice of Donkey Kong as well, unifying the ape's grunts across mediums. This was something that was previously speculated — though not confirmed — when his name popped up in the credits of Switch 2 launch title Mario Kart World, while DK's previous veteran voice actor did not.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Eagled-eyed Nintendo fans noted that Takashi Nagasako, who previously voiced Donkey Kong for 21 years, was no longer credited for the character as of Mario Kart World. At the time, this was discussed as likely yet another change by Nintendo of its long-term voice acting cast, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/princess-peach-and-toads-veteran-voice-actor-says-nintendo-told-her-shed-been-replaced-on-switch-2-launch-day-as-mario-kart-world-released-without-her-in-it">the replacement of Princess Peach and Toad actress Samantha Kelly</a> after 18 years and more than 70 games, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-charles-martinet-is-not-involved-in-super-mario-bros-wonder">retirement of Charles Martinet as the voice of Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi</a> after almost 30 years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bananza's credits also reveal a new voice for Pauline, with actress and musician Jenny Kidd now voicing the character for its English dub. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Super Mario Odyssey, Pauline is voiced by Kate Higgins, who also sings the game's theme song Jump Up, Super Star! But perhaps this change is to be expected — after all, Bananza's Pauline is now a younger, 13-year-old incarnation.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have some interesting theories around this version of Pauline being a precursor to the character we see in Odyssey, something that would make Bananza a prequel — and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-wont-say-why-donkey-kong-bananzas-pauline-is-13-years-old-specifically-wants-players-to-puzzle-out-the-answer-themselves">we even asked the game's development team for their take</a>. But to say more, for now, would venture into spoiler territory — something that's best left avoided until you play the game for yourself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Intrigued? We dubbed the game as a "a brilliant successor to Super Mario Odyssey and a smashing return for a classic Nintendo character" in IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Donkey Kong Bananza review</a>.

However, we’re still in the beginning phase, so I believe we’ll be able to reveal more details [about the new game] somewhere in the future."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Toyama did stress that he did not conclude Slitterhead with "a sequel in mind," suggesting his next game will not be Slitterhead 2, although it's possible we'll get one in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We thought Slitterhead was mediocre, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/slitterhead-review"><u>securing a 5 in IGN's review</u></a>: "Like a bloody blade worn down by a few too many battles, Slitterhead grows increasingly dull over time and ultimately just doesn’t cut it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Silent Hill franchise itself?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-review.1245819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Good news, ‘80s action fans: Blasting bad guys’ brains out and balls off is still RoboCop’s business, and business is… unfinished. A standalone expansion to 2023’s entertainingly authentic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/robocop-rogue-city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>, RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business takes Robo’s relentless rampage off the scum-riddled streets of Old Detroit and up through the heavily guarded heights of OMNI Tower in an all-new, 10-hour killing spree. The bad news is that with precious few new weapons and enemy types, the action of Unfinished Business never really elevates enough to match the skyward trajectory of its setting or distinguish itself as little more than a replay of the original. There’s still plenty of ultra violence to indulge in here, but it’s a form of mindless fun that’s as familiar as it is ferocious. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not unlike the 2012 sci-fi splatterfest movie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/dredd-3d">Dredd</a>, the action of Unfinished Business is contained almost entirely within the one highrise building and sees RoboCop making his way from the ground floor to its upper reaches in search of some stolen OCP equipment. It borrows a bit of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> as well, since Robo is initially led along by an anonymous assistant on the other end of a two-way radio, and that helps to lend a welcome air of mystery to the story’s opening half – even if it doesn’t eventually pay off with any shocking plot twists like Irrational Games’ underwater classic.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As was the case with the previous game, the success of Unfinished Business’ storytelling largely hinges on the often hilarious deadpan delivery of original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/robocop">RoboCop</a> actor Peter Weller in the main role. Whether he’s repeating iconic lines from the movies or making subtle mockery of almost everyone he meets, Weller’s performance is a noticeable cut above the rest. Admittedly, that’s not a super high bar to clear since the supporting cast often sound like they’re voiced by hastily dashed-out placeholder recordings someone forgot to fill in with the real ones, and each seem to draw from the same shallow pool of character heads, making it tough to really distinguish one from the other. In the end, I was happy to go along for the ride all the way to Unfinished Business’ bullet-riddled gore-gasm of a climax, in spite of the fact that I didn’t particularly feel compelled to focus on anyone other than the scumbags standing squarely in front of my ironsights.    </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Business As Usual</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the story, though, Unfinished Business is a fairly flat 10 hours because while it increases the amount of bad guys you have to shoot, it doesn’t do nearly enough to expand the variety of ways you do it. If you’ve played 2023’s Rogue City, then you’ve already experienced the bulk of what Unfinished Business’ combat has to offer. Once again, you’re able to ricochet bullets off walls to stylishly snipe enemies hidden behind cover, perform breach-and-clears on almost every door you come across in bloodsplattered slow-motion, and shoot explosive barrel after explosive barrel as you RoboStop and RoboDrop absolutely every criminal you come across. It’s all presented with the same fan-pleasing flair, from the green Apple IIe-like graphics of Robo’s heads-up display to the iconic theme music that swells along with the increasing enemy numbers, and that certainly still goes a long way. It’s just a shame to see the skill and Auto 9 upgrade systems copied across seemingly unchanged. You unlock the exact same perks like armour-piercing rounds and the ability to automatically deflect incoming enemy fire, just a little faster this time thanks to the story’s shorter runtime. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you’ve played 2023’s Rogue City, then you’ve already experienced the bulk of what Unfinished Business’ combat has to offer.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a handful of new mechanical enemy types to contend with at least, though none of them really shake things up to a dramatic degree. I did find myself making more consistent use of Robo’s returning slow-mo skill in order to combat the fast-moving robobombs that rapidly roll towards you, as well as the swarms of flying security drones that dart unpredictably through the air above. But while the nimble killbots that cartwheel around the place seem threatening at first blush, they quickly prove to be about as resilient as a jar of baby food as I either shattered their robot skulls with a quick burst of bullets or simply picked them up and disposed of them like katana-wielding Kleenexes, even on the hardest difficulty setting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">OMNI Tower itself does offer the occasional interesting space to host the slaughter in, from the vibrant video arcade and cinema found in the relaxation zone to the trashbag-strewn underbelly of waste management (complete with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope">Star Wars</a>-style trash compactor to frantically blast your way out of). Those are the exception, though, and most of the carnage takes place in the charmless concrete corridors in between. That’s to be expected from a tour through a corporate dystopia, sure, but it doesn’t make for a lot of fun surprises. Despite the striking gallery of gore and particle effects that shower over each firefight, there were times that Unfinished Business’ drab interiors made it feel less like a thrilling action adventure and more like wandering in circles through a shopping mall carpark trying to work out where I left my 6000 SUX. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the biggest problem I had with Unfinished Business’ gunplay was the same one I found with 2023’s Rogue City. That is, Robo’s signature Auto 9 – blessed as it is with unlimited ammo, easily upgradeable attributes, and an undeniable cool factor – makes the dozens of other firearms found throughout the campaign almost entirely redundant. It’s just so overequipped to deal with everything that’s thrown your way that I never found a good enough reason to holster it. It would be akin to a Star Wars adventure in which you default to the use of a lightsaber – you’re probably not ever going to clip it to your belt and pick up a Tusken Raider’s gaffi stick to crack heads with instead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is one exception: the cryo cannon that’s introduced in the second half proved to be worth a few charged-up trigger squeezes, especially since its sub-zero rounds turn your targets into instant ice sculptures that can be subsequently shattered like the T-1000. That’s a time-honored video game tradition that dates back to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/duke-nukem-3d">Duke Nukem 3D</a>. But otherwise I almost never felt the need to bend over and grab any other dropped firearms – and not just because Robo appears to have the knee joints of an 80-year-old man (as well as the voice of a 78-year-old). <span tabindex="-1" role="button">Tap to Reveal</span>  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Murphy’s Law</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfinished Business’ structure is effectively built around a cycle of using your Auto 9 to deep-six hordes of mercenaries, pausing to settle disputes between citizens in side missions that veer from moderately humorous to completely banal, and then flicking some switches and turning valves in its basic puzzle sections to open the path ahead before resuming the unrelenting blaze of glorious gore. There are only a handful of detours along the way that at least try to mix up the otherwise predictable pacing, with varying degrees of success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In one flashback mission we get to pull on the kevlar-lined vest of Alex Murphy in his pre-RoboCop days, as he and his fellow officers are dispatched to investigate the whereabouts of some known perps. I enjoyed this small glimpse of Murphy’s origins in the Metro South precinct even if the stilted banter between his squad was more than a little wide of the mark, and there were some fun Easter eggs to find here including a memo that referenced the ominous rise of a new criminal on the scene that I won't spoil here. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the setting of this sequence lacks imagination given that its abandoned mill surroundings are a bit too similar to the site of Murphy’s infamous ‘crucifixion’ scene witnessed in the first film, and its combat feels somewhat topsy turvy. Where RoboCop must scramble to find OCP charges in order to replenish his rapidly depleting health, regular flesh-and-bone Murphy somehow magically regains it in between shootouts. That’s typical for a lot of first-person shooters, but it’s less of a contrast to playing as a walking tank than I’d been expecting. On the flipside, Murphy can only wield his boring old service pistol, which is frustrating because this was one of the few times I actually wanted to pick up a gun I found but couldn’t. It all makes for a diversion that’s important to the plot, but not particularly compelling to play.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[RoboCop] always seems to be lit with ambient neon lights like he’s emerging out of the driver’s side of a Ford Taurus on the poster for the 1987 film. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, the same can’t be said for the late-game level where you get to pilot an ED-209 mech. This fabulously frenetic stretch of fan service allows you to use twin arm cannons to shred through each hapless human like they’re that one poor bastard executive that probably should have hid in the bathroom during the original ED-209 demonstration, blast through concrete walls with rocket barrages, and even trample over a model of Old Detroit’s skyline while battling rival robots like you’re revelling in a small-scale clash of Kaiju. Sure, it’s perhaps not as cathartic as it could have been given that by that point I’d already very efficiently turned hundreds of mercenaries into mincemeat with Robo’s Auto 9. But I can’t pretend I wasn’t grinning like an idiot through the entire sequence, which ratchets up the carnage to ludicrous levels and doesn’t linger long enough to outstay the welcome of playing as a near-invincible killing machine.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan's Favourite First-Person Shooter Campaigns</h3><p>Trigger warning!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I never got tired of seeing RoboCop himself onscreen either. As was the case with the previous game, his polished steel armour looks absolutely spot-on and he always seems to be lit with ambient neon lights like he’s emerging out of the driver’s side of a Ford Taurus on the poster for the 1987 film. That said, outside of the smooth lines of Robo’s movie-accurate character model there’s a noticeable roughness to Unfinished Business, at least on the PlayStation 5 version that I played. During my time with it I suffered frame rate dips, audio dropouts, animation glitches, dodgy lip syncing, ridiculous moon physics during slow-motion breaches, characters disappearing completely during finishing moves and story cutscenes, and even the occasional crash to the home screen. After a while I started to wonder if the “Unfinished Business” title was a nod to RoboCop’s everlasting quest for justice or merely a reference to the launch state of the game itself. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">As someone who delighted in blasting through the original RoboCop: Rogue City, my hopes for this standalone Unfinished Business expansion were higher than a junkie on Nuke. However, outside of the exhilarating playable cameo from ED-209, there’s really not enough new here to make another 10 hours as everyone’s favourite baby food-slurping supercop worth going out of your way for. Peter Weller’s deadpan delivery is as endearing as ever, and the cryo gun is an icy blast (though ironically still not quite as cool to use as the Auto 9), but the supporting cast of characters is seriously shoddy and the raft of performance issues on PlayStation 5 make for a bumpier ride than accelerating up the exit ramp from the Metro West carpark. If you thirst for some more Auto 9 bursts flourished with TJ Lazer-inspired twirls then RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business will certainly scratch the itch on your trigger finger, but it’s far from the future of law enforcement. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop has added a Black Library logo to its official Big Summer Warhammer Preview showcase, sparking speculation the company may announce new novels that finally move the overarching Warhammer 40,000 narrative forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Summer Warhammer Preview, set for this Friday, July 18, will contain reveals for Games Workshop’s main tabletop games, including Age of Sigmar, The Horus Heresy, and of course Warhammer 40,000. Its initially released digital poster for the event did not feature the logo for Black Library, Games Workshop’s in-house book publishing division. However, on July 16, it released a new version of this poster with the Black Library logo added, sparking speculation that fans will get new novel announcements as well.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/517658642-1124351393077178-5591934164739581769-n-1752732406910.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Black Library logo suggests new novel reveals.

There is a great deal of speculation that Games Workshop may finally be ready to move the Warhammer 40,000 narrative forward with either a brand new series of books, the teased meet-up between two returned primarchs, or the long-awaited third book in Dan Abnett's Bequin trilogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-the-mere-mention-of-an-nda-by-a-games-workshop-author-has-sparked-all-sorts-of-speculation-about-what-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-might-be">IGN has reported on the now mythical Pandemonium before</a>, when fans speculated its delay might have something to do with Games Workshop and Amazon getting their narrative ducks in a row ahead of the Henry Cavill-fronted Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe. It is perhaps the most-anticipated book in all Warhammer fandom. The first novel in the Bequin series, Pariah, came out in 2012. Its sequel, the Warhammer 40,000 lore treasure trove that is Penitent, followed nearly a decade later, in March 2021. Pandemonium does not have a release date, and the wait for an announcement is fast becoming Warhammer 40,000’s version of George R. R. Martin’s M.I.A. Game of Thrones book, The Winds of Winter. Some fans are speculating — perhaps more with hope than expectation — that now is finally the time for a Pandemonium reveal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's heightened interest in Pandemonium because it promises to actually move the overarching Warhammer 40,000 plot forward. Penitent ended with a significant lore revelation (it has to do with the identity of the mysterious King in Yellow, which we won’t spoil here), and so the ramifications of Pandemonium for the wider Warhammer 40,000 universe could be huge.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps more realistic is a new novel series set during the period known as The Scouring. This is the largely unexplored time in Warhammer 40,000 history when the Imperium ran down the traitor legions following the defeat of Horus 10,000 years before the current setting. With the Horus Heresy seemingly wrapped up following the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-horus-heresy-book-era-of-ruin-gets-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-talking-with-tantalizing-insight-into-the-carrion-emperor-and-the-golden-thrones-true-nature">Era of Ruin</a>, The Scouring seems like a natural next step for Games Workshop if it wants to continue filling in the gaps in the Warhammer 40,000 narrative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or this may all be much ado about nothing, and Black Library’s presence at the show ultimately goes down as a disappointment. You’d like to think that Games Workshop knew what it would do to fan expectations by slapping the Black Library logo on its preview poster, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which leads me neatly into why Warhammer 40,000 lore fans get excited by teases like this in the first place. As I’ve reported before, the Warhammer 40,000 story, such as it is, is a slow moving beast. The scribes at Games Workshop sometimes take years to inch the overarching plot forward. Take, for example, the return of beloved primarch, Lion El'Jonson, which was announced in March 2023. Now, over two years later, the character is yet to do much of anything in the setting, his hotly anticipated reunion with his brother, Roboute Guilliman, seemingly further away than ever. Could a new novel finally detail this sure to be spicy meet up?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe, on Friday, we’ll finally get some answers. The Big Summer Warhammer Preview is set for 7pm BST / 11am PDT on Friday, July 18.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
