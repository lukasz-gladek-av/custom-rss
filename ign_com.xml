(Notably, Kill Bill <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kill-bill-the-whole-bloody-affair-to-hit-theaters-later-this-year-complete-with-all-new-anime-sequence">is set for re-release on December 5</a> as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/kill-bill-the-whole-bloody-affair">Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</a>, a fresh, newly-combined version of the two Kill Bill films — something that would be well-timed for a Fortnite crossover.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a separate tease, a collection of Fortnite characters appeared yesterday at a LA Dodgers victory celebration, holding up signs and posing for photos with fans. Banana hero Peely, hotdog man The Brat, and rapper pickle Big Dill were spotted by fan <a href="https://twitter.com/Reetlol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1985521856028565880%7Ctwgr%5Ecf08f4a5fb977123883191ca1ce2b3f06cd9c585%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Ffortnite-chapter-seven-teases-kill-bill-crossover-points-to-usa-setting" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reetlol</a>, and can be seen holding signs saying "Game 7 first, Chapter Seven Next!!," "Seven," and "Nov 29" — a date fans now think is when we'll get a first glimpse at Chapter Seven.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr">👀 <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Fortnite</a> <a href="https://t.co/GHAsz9OuzC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/GHAsz9OuzC</a></p>— JOGO Reet (@Reetlol) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reetlol/status/1985521856028565880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite has always labelled the different incarnations of its battle royale map as different "chapters" of the game (which are then sub-divided into seasons). But this one, fans have noticed, is being referred to as Chapter <em>Seven</em>, spelt out, rather than the usual Chapter 7 numbering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seven holds a big significance in Fortnite lore (and thankfully no, it's nothing to do with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skrilla-claims-viral-hit-doot-doot-6-7-is-in-gta-6-im-going-to-be-my-own-person-on-there-playing-my-own-music">the 6-7 meme</a>). Throughout Fortnite's first five years, The Seven were slowly revealed as a heroic team of characters who defended the game's multiverse, and who led the charge during the game's big story events (such as the one where the original Chapter 1 Island got sucked into a black hole). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the years, The Seven's helmeted heroes were revealed to include characters played by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Brie Larsen, though after Chapter 3's grand finale, the team's story was abruptly concluded, with their members seemingly defeated and dispursed. More recent Chapters have acted as something of a reset of the game's narrative, following the departure of Epic Games' previous creative lead Donald Mustard, though fans have long held out hope of seeing The Seven once again. In a Chapter named after them, surely it's finally time?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Separately, numerous Fortnite leakers have claimed that the Chapter Seven map will include a large desert biome, with mention of an "Area 51" style location. FortniteLeaks, meanwhile, has specifically reported that the game will feature a weapon called the Gambler Shotgun — "which is related to one of the major themes of the map."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, fans are putting two and two together and arriving at the idea of Chapter Seven featuring a Nevada-style location, and have suggested a crossover with another upcoming franchise: Fallout. The game has already featured Fallout in the shape of an outfit sporting the franchise's power suit. But with new episodes of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series">Fallout TV series</a> scheduled to debut from December 17, fans have wondered whether a larger collaboration is also now on the cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until then, there's three weeks left of Fortnite's really very enjoyable The Simpsons era to enjoy, before a big live event on November 29 that's expected to usher in Chapter Seven — and whatever it holds — in style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Medios y Media/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto fans have known for some time that Rockstar Games worked on a single-player DLC for GTA 5 that would have seen Trevor assume the role of a secret agent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, voice actor Steven Ogg said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-5-had-trevor-dlc-before-rockstar-scrapped-it-voice-actor-steven-ogg-says">Rockstar originally planned to make a story expansion focused on his character, Trevor</a>, with it thought to have fallen by the wayside as the developer focused on the cash cow that was GTA Online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ogg was joined by Michael actor Ned Luke and Franklin actor Shawn Fonteno in a Questions and Answers session with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtW3WXxA0pY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Streamily</u></a>. The trio shed light on what they claimed was scrapped downloadable content for GTA 5 that starred Trevor as a Federal Investigation Bureau agent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Originally they were gonna do continuing stories of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor," Luke said, and Ogg expanded on his version. "We also had that really cool s**t of — and I forget if it was DLC, I have no idea — but where Trevor was gonna be undercover, he works for the FEDs," Ogg said. "And we did shoot some of that stuff with James Bond Trevor. He's still kind of a f**k up but he's doing his best. And we shot some stuff and then it just disappeared and they never followed up on it."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Celebrity in GTA 5 and GTA Online</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Also last year, Joe Robino, who was a senior camera artist and virtual cinematographer working at Rockstar’s New York office from 2010 to 2016, spoke to <a href="https://youtu.be/Uikfph7oQoE?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the SanInPlay YouTube channel</u></a> about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-5s-kick-ass-story-dlc-scrapped-because-gta-online-was-so-much-of-a-cash-cow-ex-rockstar-dev-claims">why the GTA 5 story DLC was canceled</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of the team went to do Red Dead Redemption 2 right away and I took on this other project that was a standalone DLC for GTA that never came out and it was kick ass,” Robino revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That was my thing. I was one of the main editors, camera artists, and on-stage stuff. We split our teams into two. I stayed on GTA Online and then this DLC, which Steven Ogg [the actor who played Trevor Philips] was a very important part of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then some of the team overlapped and went to RDR2 early on, and then we just kind of did this [flipped motion], because when that game got shelved, we spent so much money… a lot of that stuff though did end up making it I believe into later iterations of GTA Online, I think. So it’s not like they wasted it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was really really good. But when GTA Online came out it was so much of a cash cow and people were loving it so much that it was hard to make an argument that a standalone DLC would outcompete that. I think looking back now you could probably do both. But that was a business decision they made. I was a little upset about that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That actually was a lot of the reason for me being a little sour at that time. Because I was like yo, WTF guys? This s**t’s awesome. Let’s keep going. Let’s finish this s**t.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have had snippets of information about GTA 5’s fabled story DLC over the years. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-gta-6-waiting-in-the-wings-fans-find-possible-evidence-of-cut-gta-5-story-dlc-canned-bully-2"><u>GTA dataminers have also discovered a reference to Trevor with a jetpack</u></a>, which suggests story mode DLC was repurposed into GTA Online, as Robino said. In 2018, Rockstar finally unveiled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/gta-5/The_Doomsday_Heist"><u>GTA Online's Doomsday Heist missions</u></a> alongside the Thruster jetpack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, speaking on the <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=-F5wXQ6TeJHbbkfI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lex Fridman podcast</a>, Rockstar Games co-founder and former lead writer Dan Houser has addressed this DLC for the first time, insisting that if the developer had continued with it, it wouldn’t have been able to make 2018’s Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The internet knows we made a DLC… single-player DLC for GTA 5 that never came out,” Houser said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was one when you played as Trevor, but he was a secret agent. It was cute. It never quite came together, and it was never finished. It was about half done when it got abandoned. But I think if that had come out, we probably wouldn’t have gotten to make Red Dead 2. So, there are always compromises.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the first time Houser has addressed the canceled GTA 5 story DLC, but it turns out there’s another project he would have loved to have made while he was at the studio: GTA Zombies. “I liked the idea of it, it was a GTA zombie game,” he said. “That would have been funny. I think that could have been quite fun.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every GTA Game Ranked</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA fans often lament the loss of single-player story DLC for GTA 5 after it did so well for previous GTA games. Houser said he remains a big fan of single-player DLC, and is hoping to make some as part of his new company, Absurd Ventures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I like making the stories,” he said. “For me, I love the model of GTA 4 when you had the extra stories coming afterwards, or Red Dead 1 when you had the zombie pack coming afterwards. I like just doing these extra things. So, I would personally like to have done more of that in that company. And with stuff we’re doing in the future, we’re going to try and come up with worlds where we can add more stories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I like single-player DLC. I just think the audience loves it, and it’s really fun to make.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/gettyimages-2237849657-1762257766339.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dan Houser at 2025 Los Angeles Comic Con.

In September, he said he felt "absolutely nothing" inside for GTA 6 because he’s never been a fan of video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of revelations in Lex Fridman’s Dan Houser interview, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-question-if-you-can-even-make-a-good-open-world-spy-game-rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-finally-explains-why-agent-never-happened">the fate of canceled PS3 exclusive Agent</a>, and Houser’s thoughts on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-needed-guns-you-needed-these-larger-than-life-characters-rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-explains-why-grand-theft-auto-wont-leave-the-united-states">why GTA won’t leave the United States in terms of setting</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
