            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Three weeks ago on this day, I featured <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-october-10">Mega Evolution in my weekly Crashers and Climbers article</a>, which focused on the set doing the typical evening out after the drop of a new set. Some cards were going up, some were going down, business as usual. Damn sneaker heads!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to today, after a seemingly massive print run, everything is crashing. Literally every card you can pick out of this set is seeing new lows. For me, this is a market correction after a year of inflated prices both on the sealed and single card markets for a variety of factors I've discussed before.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Mega Evolution: All Crashers And Zero Climbs</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst I don't think we're seeing the bubble burst on the market just yet, we're seeing a massive market correction that could see a decline in scalped product and more availability across the board. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you can't tell by now, I won't be including a "Climbers" section today, but I'll be diving into just how much values have crashed in the last three weeks and bag my readers a few bargains in the process. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the top cards from Mega Evolution at a glance, and we're seeing between 8% and 33% drops in just three weeks. Full disclosure, the "Original Prices" on these cards are what I recorded on 10th October, just so we're on the same page.</p><p id="bulbasaur-133132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Bulbasaur - 133/132">Bulbasaur - 133/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229411"><div id="229411" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bulbasaur - 133/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like N's Reshiram Illustration Rare in Journey Together, this Bulbasaur Illustration Rare has a Mega Evolution Stamped version that's packed into every Enhanced Booster Box. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it's a bit of a tough one to say which one is rarer, although I'd put my Pokédollars on the stamped version getting rarer over time. Needless to say it's a gorgeous card either way that's dropped by 23% from October 10.</p></div><p id="bulbasaur-133132-mega-evolution"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Bulbasaur - 133/132 (Mega Evolution ">Bulbasaur - 133/132 (Mega Evolution Stamp)</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229410"><div id="229410" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bulbasaur - 133/132 (Mega Evolution Stamp)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a similar scenario with the Mega Evolution Stamp variant of Bulby, but the floor on this card seems to be a little higher than the standard IR. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It still dropped by 23%, but we're seein it retain a couple of dollars more in value. When you're right, you're right.</p></div><p id="mega-kangaskhan-ex-182132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Kangaskhan ex - 182/132">Mega Kangaskhan ex - 182/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229406"><div id="229406" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Kangaskhan ex - 182/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Khankaskhan ex SIR has only had an 8% drop, but it's a drop none-the-less. This card hardly broke expectations on the market, securing a low-end SIR level of value out the gate. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So whilst we're not seeing dramatic crashes here, we've got a solid value on this card that should only rise over time.</p></div><p id="mega-absol-ex-180132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Absol ex - 180/132">Mega Absol ex - 180/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229992"><div id="229992" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Absol ex - 180/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Absol ex SIR is an absolute banger, and in my opinion one of the best from this set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some reason this card didn't go mad when Mega Evolution came out, but it's still had a drop of 9% to a respectable $96.01 at the moment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is such an underated card, and I'd highly reccomend snapping it up whilst values are down.</p></div><p id="alakazam-003-staff"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Alakazam - 003 (Staff)">Alakazam - 003 (Staff)</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229991"><div id="229991" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alakazam - 003 (Staff)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Staff cards are always ridiculous value-wise due to the small distribution base and not being available in booster packs. A handfull are given out at Pokémon TCG events such as tournaments, and this one has actually dropped by 16%. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Secondary market prices always go off what people are willing to pay, but it's still a coin flip situation. If you collect staff cards, It might be worth picking up whilst it's nearly $30 less than October 10.</p></div><p id="mega-latias-ex-181132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Latias ex - 181/132">Mega Latias ex - 181/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229404"><div id="229404" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Latias ex - 181/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At over $20 cheaper and a 13% price crash, I'd bit for Mega Latias ex SIR for under $150. It's a gorgeous card and has ridiculously expresive artwork. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't see this card loosing a lot more value, so i'd recommend picking this bad boy up before it shoots back up.</p></div><p id="mega-venusaur-ex-177132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Venusaur ex - 177/132">Mega Venusaur ex - 177/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229405"><div id="229405" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Venusaur ex - 177/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Venusaur is the best generation one starter and i'll live on that hill, because I can't die with Venusaur at my side. Correct opinions aside, this card is getting more and more affordable has time goes on, In just three weeks this card has dropped by over $30, or 20%, to $174.80. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally I think this card can settle to $150, but that's just a gut feeling. Considering how playable it is with the help of Meganium, this feels like a good price.</p></div><p id="mega-gardevoir-ex-178132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Gardevoir ex - 178/132">Mega Gardevoir ex - 178/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229403"><div id="229403" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Gardevoir ex - 178/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is arguably the chase card of the set for those who don't like Gold Hyper Rares, just look at it. Not only is Gardevoir a fan favorite (Let's forget about that life-sized weeb plush), but its a work of art. This has crashed massively by over $80, to a much more respectable $234.99, and i'd put a solid bet on this card climbing right back up in no time. </p></div><p id="mega-lucario-ex-179132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Lucario ex - 179/132">Mega Lucario ex - 179/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229409"><div id="229409" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Lucario ex - 179/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is my favorite card of the set, featuring an expresive sky-high battle over Luminoise City between Mega Lucario and Mega Venusaur. For me it's a continuation of the Charizard V Alt Art from the Sword and Shield era featuring Venusaur. Top tier artwork and two fan favorite Pokémon and it's 20% down on Oct. 10, it's a great time to buy this card.</p></div><p id="mega-gardevoir-ex-187132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Gardevoir ex - 187/132">Mega Gardevoir ex - 187/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229407"><div id="229407" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Gardevoir ex - 187/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This gold rare has had one of the biggest drops i've seen for a while. This was going for $600 on Oct. 10, and it's dropped by a massive 33% to $399, which I think is about the right value for it now. If history teaches us anything, Gold Rares go down not up. But the unique embossed patterns and rainbow holo effect Mega Evolution Gold Rares have seems to be turning more heads. Personally it's not for me, but it's a tied top chase card with Mega Lucario ex Gold Rare.</p></div><p id="mega-lucario-ex-188132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Lucario ex - 188/132">Mega Lucario ex - 188/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229402"><div id="229402" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Lucario ex - 188/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you think $530 is eye-watering, this card was a massive $630 three weeks ago, so it's deffinately moving in the right direction. One thing i've noticed about Mega Evolution cards today, is that we're at the point where the cards have hit a new flooor. This will bring more buyers in, create more demand and we'll see a rise once again. So if you were after this card, now is likely the best time to get locked in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/painkiller-2025-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/painkiller-review.1340713/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Every now and then, some suit at a publisher looks at a beloved series they own, realizes they could make it into a live service co-op game, and says, out loud, “I know this has never worked for anyone else, but it might work for <em>us</em>.” It never does, of course; it makes the original fanbase angry, and oftentimes the franchise is old enough that new players don’t even know what it is. The result is a game for no one, a whole lot of nothing driven by market forces and the deluded belief that somehow, some way, this time the idea is just <em>better</em> than all of the previous times it’s been tried. This time, they, chosen by God, will be immune from whatever effects have frustrated lesser mortals. The latest game in this doomed genre is Painkiller, a reboot of People Can Fly’s 2004 cult classic, and the result is the same as it ever was. It’s fitting that it takes place in Purgatory. When it is consigned to the graveyard of history, its headstone will read “Here lies Painkiller, neither good enough to get into heaven nor bad enough to be damned to the inferno. You’ll wish you’d just played the original and called it a day, or simply booted up the Judas Priest song instead.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new Painkiller is one of <em>those</em> co-op games. You know the ones; a brief tutorial frontloads the meager plot, shows you the ropes and unlocks your base of operations. Once established, you pick from one of four visually-distinct-but-aside-from-one-passive-ability-virtually-identical-characters, all of whom come with pre-packaged quips that mostly sound like they were written by Dollar Store Joss Whedon. After selecting your weapons and loadout, you choose one of several missions, where you go to a place and kill a lot of bad guys, then return to your base with the spoils, where you can upgrade your stuff, and do it all again. You have seen all of this before, and I’m already bored describing it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The story here is basically nonexistent. You are one of four souls stuck in Purgatory – Ink, Void, Roch, and Sol – approached by the disembodied voice of the angel Metatron to stop the demon Azazel, another faceless voice, from Doing Something Bad. Go on mission, go home, spend spoils, repeat. To Painkiller's infinite credit, there is no paid currency or battle pass here, just a Season Pass with skins and the like, But the loop never varies – once you get New and Better Stuff, it's just time to go do whatever Metratron determines needs doing next. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That really doesn’t sound like Painkiller,” you might say if you played the original – and you, reader, you win the solid gold Kewpie doll, because it isn’t like Painkiller at all! If you squint, you can see the inspirations, though I use this term loosely. There are tarot cards, though you “win” a selection of them by spending gold in the Tarot Lottery because everything about video games is gambling now (even if you’re not spending real money), and equip them before missions for bonuses like +50 health and 30% more damage. Once the mission is over, your tarot cards are used up and you either have to spend more gold in the lottery or Ancient Souls, which you earn during missions, to restore one you’ve previously used. You can also use these currencies to buy and upgrade weapons, and you generally won’t have enough to do that and have tarot cards early on.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This isn't a Painkiller game; it's Warhammer 40k: Darktide wearing a Painkiller suit.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of, much of the original game’s iconic arsenal has been resurrected here like the Stakegun and Electrodriver, complete with their amusing alt fires. However, the titular Painkiller (which you always have) is now doing its best impression of Doom Eternal’s chainsaw, there to get you more ammo when your other guns run out. Sometimes, levels will lock you into a large, usually circular or rectangular space and make you kill a lot of enemies, though none of them are as visually striking or bats**t insane as the original rogues’ gallery. The similarities end there. This is not a Painkiller game; it is Warhammer 40,000: Darktide wearing a Painkiller skin suit, and hoping nobody cares enough to notice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Painkiller looks good, but its problems really come down to mission design. Environments feel samey even when they look different, and each of the three acts (which are three levels apiece) finds a single gameplay idea and never lets go of it. Your progress will be stopped by <em>something</em> and the only way through will be Doing That Act’s Mechanic: in the first, that means filling barrels with blood by killing enemies near them and then slotting those into the proper place; in the second, you’ll need to find and use soul containers to power things; in the third, you’ll have to stand on ritual markers to activate dreamcatchers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Occasionally, Painkiller will mix it up a bit – I actually liked the spots where my team had to use the soul containers to power a large cart we had to escort, but moments like that are rare. Mostly, you do the same things over and over again, moving through the environments, collecting gold, finding hidden chests, and picking up consumables –one plops down health; another plops down ammo; the third is a mostly useless decoy you will never pick up unless the other two are not available; and the fourth is an extra life; that’s it. You’re then locked into a combat arena until you either get enough blood canisters/soul containers/dreamcatchers to proceed or everything barring your path is dead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the combat isn’t as satisfying as it should be. Most enemies are cohorts, harmless by themselves but potentially dangerous in large numbers (and they <em>always</em> come in large numbers) that die easily. There are also larger, more dangerous demons you can stagger by pouring on alt fires or kill outright, and the end of act Nephilim, who serve as bosses. None of these are all that engaging aside from the Nephilim, and while there are several different kinds of cohorts and a handful of demons, none of them have much of a unique visual identity. There are no Psychonuns or Hell Bikers or Evil Samurai or Freaks, nothing that made the original game’s wacky evil ensemble memorable. No, this is Purgatory by way of a heavy metal album cover if it were generated by AI. If you’re going to do Painkiller, it could at least <em>look like </em>Painkiller, you know?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's Purgatory by way of a heavy metal album cover if it were generated by AI.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most infuriatingly, Painkiller isn’t out and out <em>bad. </em>The movement is fast, precise, and a hell of a time – you can slide, dash, air dash, <em>dash</em> <em>through enemies,</em> bounce off walls for a double jump, and use the Painkiller to grapple to various anchor points (or enemies!). All six of the guns, whether it’s the Electrodriver, Rocket Launcher, Hand Cannon, Stakegun, Shotgun, or SMG, feel great, and I liked messing around with the various alt fires. A shotgun that freezes enemies so I can shatter them? Neat. A Stakegun that’s also a grenade launcher or can create a gravity well? Love it. Turning the Rocket Launcher into a minigun that shoots rockets that freeze? Sign me up. And getting a new upgrade on a weapon’s branching paths feels meaningful and changes how you play. Yeah, a lot of it is “we have Doom Eternal at home,” but if you’re going to steal, you might as well steal from the best.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I even came to enjoy the characters, particularly Sol, a haughty, eternally youthful priestess, and Void, a straight man with a self-described fishbowl for a head and no memory of his past. Even Ink’s sarcasm and self-loathing and Roch’s tragic backstory aren’t poorly written, really. (The bad stuff is reserved for in-combat dialogue.) The issue is you rarely get to hear them finish telling each other their stories because you’ll run into some enemies and the background heavy metal (which is good) will kick in, or another character will spout some inane combat dialogue and the story dialogue you were hearing will just stop dead and never resume. Yeah, you can read it in the codex at your home base, but it’s not voiced, and the voice cast does admirable work with what they have. Bummer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The boss fights against the Nephilim are pretty good, too. They’re not groundbreaking – you’ve seen a lot of these mechanics before – but they’re engaging to play and they look cool, whether it’s a massive blood rat, a big statue hiding a secret, or a literal dragon. These are the best parts of the roughly four or so hours it takes to play straight through Painkiller’s Raid (read: campaign) mode, and a nice change of pace from the “we’re not locked in here with you, you’re locked in here with <em>us</em>” standard encounters.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Co-op Shooters</h3><p>There are a lot of co-op shooters out there. Here are the best ones.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Painkiller is designed as a three-player co-op game, and that’s the best way to play it, but if you’re short on friends or nobody’s around online, the bots are pretty good and respond well to player commands. Ordering them to stand on a switch to open a secret area is less intuitive than one of your co-op partners seeing the switch and just doing it, but it works, and I didn’t mind playing with bots when no one else was on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Disappointment still manages to creep in, though. I figured Painkiller’s blink-and-you’ll-miss it plot was setting us up for a showdown with Azazel when we finished all nine levels, but nope. You just get access to his empty tomb where his voice offers you the chance to work for him. Your character naturally declines and he pivots to offering, and I kid you not, this is an actual line of dialogue, “a higher difficulty” and the opportunity for more violence and chaos. Sure, Azazel, why not? I’m already having <em>so</em> much fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is also a roguelike mode to try out, and I enjoyed it because, unlike the Raid levels, there’s a lot more variety, and you can take your rewards back with you. You might navigate a platforming segment between fights that hurts you for as long as you’re in it or have to bring soul canisters up to the top of a ziggurat. Even the “we’re gonna lock you in a combat arena until either everything else is dead or all of you are” bits are more fun here just because you haven’t seen these environments before, and the randomized nature of your weapons, alt fires, and tarot cards feels more natural. It’s like this is what the Painkiller reboot was <em>supposed to be</em> before someone decided it should have a campaign, too. Unfortunately, during my first roguelike run, my game crashed. Talk about being damned.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Painkiller is a frustrating game. The designs for the Raid levels and enemies are largely disappointing, the story is nearly nonexistent and ends on a low note, and the Great Value Wheedonisms the characters deploy in combat often had my eyes nearly rolling out of their sockets. But I can’t dismiss it outright, either. The movement and weapons are a lot of fun, the bosses are memorable, I grew to like the characters, and the roguelike mode feels like what Painkiller wants to be. Like its characters, this is a game stuck in-between. Unworthy of heaven, but not bad enough for hell. I can’t imagine who this is for, because it’s not Painkiller fans, and even as a co-op game, it’s held back by obvious limitations. It’s a game about nothing for no one, a mediocre resurrection of a classic trying to put a new cover on an old book and hoping it still has some relevance 21 years later. Yeah. Purgatory sounds about right.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/painkiller-2025-review]]></content:encoded>
