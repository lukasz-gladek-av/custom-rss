            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Aggro Crab, the developer of Another Crab's Treasure and the recently-released co-op survival climbing game Peak, took aim at a Roblox clone version of the latter in a Twitter/X post today, in which the studio said it would rather people pirate Peak than play "this microtransaction-riddled Roblox slop ripoff".</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">tbh would rather you pirate our game than play this microtransaction-riddled <a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Roblox</a> slop ripoff <a href="https://t.co/ulRShLLGz2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ulRShLLGz2</a></p>— AGGRO CRAB 💥 (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1952475157433549083?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1952475157433549083" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post in question</a> shows screenshots of a Roblox game called "Cliff", which does look suspiciously similar to Aggro Crab's Peak. Both games feature a round-headed protagonist whose goal is to climb a mountain at the center of an island, an activity that can be accomplished either alone or with friends. Cliff even calls out in its description that it's inspired by Peak!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though, "inspired" might be a bit generous. Take a look at the two game descriptions side-by-side. Here's Peak:</p><blockquote>PEAK is a co-op climbing game where the slightest mistake can spell your doom. Either solo or as a group of lost nature scouts, your only hope of rescue from a mysterious island is to scale the mountain at its center. Do you have what it takes to reach the PEAK?<p>WORK TOGETHER</p></blockquote><blockquote>Need a Hand? You’ll need to rely on your friends to have any hope of scaling the mountain, which changes every single day. Help each other up ledges, or place ropes and climbing spikes to make the way easier for those who come after.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">And this is Cliff:</p><blockquote>⛰️CLIFF is a challenging climbing game where even the smallest mistake can be your downfall. Trapped on a mysterious island, your only way to escape is to reach the top of the towering cliff. Do you have the skill and courage to make it to the summit?</blockquote><blockquote>✋WORK TOGETHER</blockquote><blockquote>Need some help? You’ll have to rely on your friends if you want any chance of reaching the top. The mountain is tough, so help each other up ledges and watch out for dangers to make the climb easier for those who come after you.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Woof, that's...the same? It's essentially just the same description copied wholesale with some swapped synonyms. And a comparison of the Badges for Cliff and the Steam Achievements for Peak reveals that Cliff also named its "Shore" and "Tropics" biomes directly after Peak's locations of the same names.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest material difference between the two games, apart from things like quality and scope, is that Cliff has microtransactions. You can buy certain items using Robux including a Climbing Pickaxe, a Parrot Friend, and a Starterpack. Peak doesn't have any such thing. It's $8 for the game itself, and that's it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is unfortunately a common phenomenon on Roblox. Plug the name of just about any game, AAA or indie, into Roblox's search feature and you'll find countless clones. On just a quick search I was able to find microtransaction-filled variations on Pokemon, Mario, Sonic, Undertale, Untitled Goose Game, Five Nights at Freddy's (woof, there are LOADS of those), Fortnite, Elden Ring, Stardew Valley, Celeste...I could go on. Some of these games are marketed as homages or fangames, but many just straight-up use stolen assets from the games they're based on, and others are pretty blatant clones trying to disguise themselves by changing some proper nouns around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given Roblox's historical <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-makes-big-changes-to-parental-controls-amid-pedophile-hellscape-report">whack-a-mole approach to moderation</a> it's hard to say whether or not Aggro Crab's callout will have any effect on Cliff. But at least the studio has made its wishes known. Probably, the solution is just to buy Peak. But if you're so desperate you're going to play Cliff instead, the developers would prefer you engage in some piracy instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm a massive fan of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player board games</a>, especially ones that are designed specifically for head-to-head or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> play like 7 Wonders: Duel, Sky Team, and Splendor: Duel. These games tend to play faster than those with larger player counts, but still offer the juicy decision-making I crave. So when I heard about Zenith, a new tug-of-war-style dueling game set in space, I was immediately intrigued. Zenith features strategic resource management, high player interaction, cards, light engine-building, and a tech track – all packed into an experience that plays in under 30 minutes (making it a good <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">quick-playing board game</a>). It checks all the boxes for me and has quickly become one of my favorite games to pull off the shelf.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What's in the Box</h2><div catalogid="a30e96ef-17d6-47f2-88b0-73b35d89d8d4" id="225510"><div id="225510" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zenith Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Zenith manages to pack a lot of components into a relatively small box. Inside, you'll find three separate game boards (Planet, Technology, and Diplomacy), that connect together to create the main play area. The Technology boards are double-sided, allowing you to mix-and-match to create a randomized progression track before each game that players will need to adapt their strategy to match. Each player uses a set of wooden tech markers to track their progress during the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of small cardboard pieces to remove from the punchboards before you start, including three different credit denominations which function as the game's primary currency, bonus tokens, and the Leader badge. The rest of the components are made from high-quality recycled materials, including 80% wood, and all feature an etched design. They have a nice weight to them, and also smell great (who doesn't love the smell of fresh wood?)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zenith's other currency, the aptly-named Zenithium, is represented by a set of yellow wooden tokens. Players primarily interact with each other during the game through the Influence disks that are placed on the Planet board. Each disk features a different color and etched design to represent one of the five planets you're vying for control over: Mercury, Venus, Terra, Mars, and Jupiter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay in Zenith revolves around its deck of more than 90 unique Agent cards split across the three factions. Each Agent card includes a name and playful character artwork, many of which are subtle nods to famous sci-fi icons like Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick, Frank Herbert, Ray Bradbury, and George Lucas, just to name a few. I had a blast trying to figure out the dozens of references sprinkled throughout the deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the relatively short instruction manual, Zenith also includes two player reference cards that outline turn structure, as well as two double-sided aids that explain the myriad effects found on the Agent cards and Tech board.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the surface, Zenith is a very straightforward game; the first player to take control of the senate wins. This can be achieved in one of three ways: controlling three of the same planet, controlling four unique planets, or controlling any five planets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You gain control of a planet when you have enough Influence, indicated by the colored disks on the Planet board. Each planet has a track with nine spaces: four on your side, four on your opponent's side, and one in the middle. Throughout the game, you and your opponent play cards and develop technology to move each of the five Influence disks back and forth across their corresponding tracks as you try to achieve one of the victory conditions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To set up, players sit opposite one another with the Planet board in the middle. Three Tech boards are chosen at random (one for each faction) that connect to one side of the Planet board, with the Diplomacy board connecting to the other side. Each of boards has a distinct pattern on the bottom that ensures it's connected to the correct side of the Planet board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players randomly distribute the bonus tokens across the Planet and Tech boards, take 12 credits and one Zenithium, and draw four cards from the deck to make their starting hand. Because the hand sizes are small, you can mulligan any number of cards to give you the best possible start. Once players have finalized their hand, the game is ready to begin.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Zenith features strategic resource management, high player interaction, cards, light engine-building, and a tech track – all packed into an experience that plays in under 30 minutes</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Players take turns performing one of three actions during their turn: recruit an Agent, develop a technology, or become the Leader. To recruit an Agent, you play a card from your hand, paying for its cost in credits and applying the card's effects. Every card in the deck has a unique effect, and there is a <em>lot</em> of iconography to remember, so you'll likely be relying on the effect description aid quite a bit during your first few games. Each Agent card gains you at least one influence on the corresponding planet, which allows you to move the matching Influence disk towards your side of the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you recruit Agents, they are placed in a column below the corresponding planet. Each Agent that has been played provides a discount of one credit for future Agents of the same color. This light <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine-building</a> component incentivizes recruiting multiple Agents to the same planet and allows you to play more powerful Agents without disrupting your economy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An alternate action you can take during your turn is developing a technology, which is tracked on the Technology board. Each of the three Tech boards represent one of the game's three factions: Humans, Robots, and Animods, which are basically just anthropomorphic animals. Instead of recruiting an Agent (playing the card from your hand to gain influence), you can play the corresponding faction to its Tech track after paying the required cost in Zenithium. However, this resource can also be used to unlock powerful effects on certain cards, so you'll need to manage your reserves wisely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each faction's Tech track contains five spaces that increase in cost incrementally as you move up, while providing more powerful effects. The first space of each column only costs one Zenithium and has a relatively lackluster effect. But, each time you move up the Tech track, you'll get to perform every action below it when you move up to the next level. This makes the Technology board an important part of your strategy, as it can have game-altering effects as you reach the top.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early on, though, investing in the tech track can feel like a loss of momentum as it doesn't immediately help you gain Influence, so you'll need to balance this carefully as part of your strategy. While investing in a single faction's tech track has increasingly powerful rewards, investing in all three factions equally is another viable option as it provides you Influence when every faction reaches the next tier. The Tech board is an important part of the overall game and shouldn't be ignored, or you'll quickly lose ground to your opponent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last action you can choose to perform during your turn is becoming the Leader of a faction. By discarding a specific faction's card, you gain a one-time effect, as well as the Leader badge. Each faction has a different effect that helps improve your economy: Humans provide you with 4 credits, Robots give you one Zenithium, and Animods allow you to mobilize two cards (place two cards from the top of your deck under the corresponding planet without applying their effect).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Leader badge is important because it increases your hand size while holding it (the only way to do so), while also unlocking powerful bonus effects on some cards. This coveted component often makes for a mini tug-of-war game within the greater game as both players try to keep it in their control and reap its benefits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the strategy in Zenith boils down to carefully managing your resources. Between credits, Zenithium, your recruited Agents, and the cards in your hand, it's a delicate balance as you try to gain tempo over your opponent. Low on credits? You won't be able to play any Agents from your hand. Low on Zenithium? You progress on the Tech board is stalled until you manage to get some more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only aspect that you have little control over is the cards in your hand, as you always draw up to your hand size at the end of your turn and can't discard anything in your hand that isn't useful (with the exception of one Agent that allows you to dump your entire hand when played). While uncommon, there are moments where you can effectively brick while digging for a specific color card or faction. Most of the time it's the result of poorly mismanaging your resources, but when it happens it feels bad to watch your opponent gain momentum. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zenith features a high level of player interaction, but never manages to feel unfair. Many cards feature effects that disrupt your opponent's board state like Transfer, which allows you to move an Agent from your opponent's side of the board to the matching column on your side, or Exile, which lets you discard one of the Agents on your opponent's side. Investing in the various Tech tracks can allow you to take some credits or Zenithium, but they have a finite number of uses. While these effects can be annoying, one aspect about Zenith that I appreciate is that there's absolutely no way to disrupt your opponent's hand or outright drain their economy by playing cards. This creates a level playing field for both players and limits the amount of "bullying" that just feels bad in other games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Zenith is designed for two players, there's a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">4-player</a> version that pits two teams against one another. While the rules are largely the same, teammates control their own hand of Agents that they can't discuss with one another, and can only recruit Agents on the three planets on their half of the board. When obtaining the Leader badge, that player can choose to give two cards to their teammate, but otherwise can't share any resources. It's an interesting twist on the standard game, but Zenith truly shines best at the intended two player count.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Zenith</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QbbkrE?object_uuid=ba928005-74cc-4887-a40f-c9a611e1b2fd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DNR4VHPQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">More Two-Player Board Games We Recommend</h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 5, 2025 5:58 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Zenith is a strategic space duel for two where players fight over control of five planets by gaining the most influence. Throughout the game, players will play cards from their hand to recruit Agents with powerful effects, develop technology to swing the game in their favor, and appoint themselves Leader of one of three factions as they grapple for victory. It features a high level of strategic yet fair player interaction that challenges both players to carefully manage their resources, or risk losing tempo to their opponent. With meaningful decisions and tense tug-of-war gameplay packed into a brisk 30-minute experience, Zenith has quickly become one of my favorite two-player games to pull off the shelf.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/zenith-board-game-review-galactic-tug-of-war-for-two]]></content:encoded>

Resident Evil has a new ultimate adversary — Duolingo's dreaded Owl.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For unknown reasons, Japan's official Resident Evil social media account has begun posting pictures of the Duolingo Owl terrorising Leon S. Kennedy in a warped version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-official-account-declares-the-duolingo-bird-its-new-biological-weapon-duolingo-responds-english-or-spanish/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here, the Duolingo Owl — or a buff, supersized version of it — can be seen replacing the menacing Mr X in images that have more than a whiff of AI about them. "Our new biological weapon," the official Resident Evil account states, tagging in the official Duolingo Japan account. "Go. Spread language learning to the world."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Picking up on the brandter, Duolingo Japan then replied with an image of the young Leon S. Kennedy pursued by its mascot, now wearing a Mr X-style hat. "Leon, you haven't done today's lesson, right?" the caption reads. Gulp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil then replied with an image of Leon using Duolingo to learn Spanish — a nod to the events of Resident Evil 4, which is set in rural Spain. The app even shows a lesson being set by one of the game's infected ganados. "Story of my life," reads the post's accompanying text.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concluding this bizarre saga, a final post from Duolingo Japan shows its mascot, again wearing Mr X's hat, reaching out while standing in front of the burning Raccoon City Police Department.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby and the Forgotten Land's upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade, Star-Crossed World, is dropping on August 28, but until now we didn't have very many details about what exactly the big update to Kirby's biggest adventure would entail. But a new trailer today has cleared up a lot of questions around the scope of this sparkly upgrade, including a look at what new enormous objects Kirby can fit in his ridiculous stretchy mouth.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The upgrade comes with the usual slate of performance improvements for the base game of Kirby and the Forgotten Land, and yeah, dang, the original campaign sure looks smooth. But the meat of the upgrade is in the new Star-Crossed World content, which is unlockable once you've finished the first world of Forgotten Land's campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In it, a glittery meteor smashes into the Forgotten Land and transforms familiar levels into Starry Stages, where shimmering star pathways open up new areas and star fragments power up monsters into stronger versions of themselves. There are also new coins to collect, new figurines, and a new boss rush in the Colosseum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But really, it's the level changes that are the most exciting. While some of the shifts seem to be just interesting little branching paths in familiar places, other Starry Stages appear significantly transformed, including one level where waters part and you run around on the ocean floor. These stages also take advantage of three new Mouthful Mode transformations. In one, Kirby eats a spring and is able to bounce extremely high. In another, he eats a big gear and can roll around, including up and down and along walls, opening up a whole new dimension to movement. And in the third, Kirby can eat a big sign and slide down slopes really fast.</p><div id="nintendo-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Series Tier List</h3><h3>Nintendo Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The big takeaway from today's trailer is that Kirby and the Forgotten Land's Switch 2 upgrade seems like it's trying to earn its $20 upgrade price tag (or $80 full price, if you don't already own the Switch 1 version). When it was first announced, there were some concerns about how expensive the update would be relative to what players were getting out of it. But Star-Crossed World seems like a proper, full DLC for Kirby's first-ever 3D adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And a well-deserved one, too. If you somehow skipped Forgotten Land first time around, the Switch 2 version seems like a good opportunity to revisit a game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review">we gave an 8/10</a>, saying it "successfully warps the series’ classic mix of ability-based combat, platforming, and secret hunting into the third dimension."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
