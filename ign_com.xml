"They killed her family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree outside her home. But Atsu survived. She learned to fight, to kill, and to hunt, and after years away she has returned to her home with a list of six names: The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"One by one, she’s hunting them down to avenge her family, armed with the same katana used to pin her to that burning tree all those years ago. But while Atsu’s story begins with vengeance, she’ll find there’s more to her journey than just revenge. As she explores Ezo, Atsu will meet unlikely allies and forge connections that help give her a new sense of purpose."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a big year for blockbuster open world video games set in Japan dealing with protagonists on a quest for revenge with a list of cryptic targets to track down. Ghost of Yōtei will arrive just six months after Assassin's Creed Shadows, Ubisoft's own effort, that is set to receive a major DLC expansion at some point before the end of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help with the wait for more details, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-gameplay-story-latest-news">everything we know about Ghost of Yōtei</a> right here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Is Leon S. Kennedy Resident Evil’s most popular character because he starred in one of the best Resident Evil games of all time? Or did he star in one of the best Resident Evil games of all time because he’s the series’ most popular character? I’ll never know for sure. Nevertheless, ever since his first day on the job at the Raccoon City Police Department back in 1998, Leon’s influence over the Resident Evil series has only grown to the point that his popularity threatens the future of the series… again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Resident Evil 4 hit shelves on January 11, 2005, everything we knew about Resident Evil was upended. The series’s famous fixed camera perspective gave way to a fully 3D camera, and the infamous tank controls were replaced with fast-paced action and melee combat. And Leon Kennedy, who was introduced to the series in Resident Evil 2 as a fresh-faced rookie police officer, was promoted to a secret agent action hero tasked with rescuing the U.S. President’s daughter from an evil cult. Leon became more Ethan Hunt and less Ash Williams. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/03/02/for-edit-re4-preview-02-b-roll-en-sub-20230221-mp4-00-05-00-19-still001-1677758817128.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil 4’s status as a Hall of Fame video game is undisputed, but the 2005 release also caused Capcom to enter a period of being lost in the wilderness. The overwhelming success of Resident Evil 4 shifted the series towards a more action-focused tone, at the expense of its horror elements. Resident Evil 5 took us to Africa, where Las Plagas-infected militia troops engaged in car chases and gunfights. Resident Evil 6 pushed things to the next level, with Call of Duty-like street battles and explosive plane crashes. But while these games followed the blueprint set by Resident Evil 4 to tremendous financial success, fans weren’t wholly satisfied with the overall direction of the franchise. It increasingly became clear that turning Resi’s former everyday cops into MMA-trained super agents had eroded away the series’ core.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To rediscover the horror at the heart of the franchise, Capcom effectively rebooted Resident Evil in 2017 with Biohazard, the series’ seventh mainline game. It ditched Leon and many of the franchise’s iconic (now incredibly powerful) characters in favor of unknown newcomer Ethan Winters who, despite a surprising resilience to a variety of gnarly hand injuries, was essentially an “everyman”. Resident Evil 7 also adopted a new first-person perspective that not only put players directly face-to-face with the game’s many scares but also restricted Ethan’s moveset — there would be no roundhouse kicks here. This new formula led to sales success and the start of a new storyline focused on the Winters family (with an occasional cameo by legacy character Chris Redfield.) </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Leon became more Ethan Hunt and less Ash Williams.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">During the era of Resident Evil 7 and Village, there was little demand for Capcom to revisit the more action-prominent design of Resident Evil 4. That’s likely because, while  Leon might not have been at the forefront of the series during this time, he was still hanging around thanks to remakes of older games. Resident Evil 2 reinvented the PS1 classic in a guise that more closely resembled the over-the-shoulder, gun-heavy design of Leon’s most famous adventure, while the Resident Evil 4 remake replicated the original’s balance of horror and suplex tackles. But as time has gone on, it’s become clear that fans have been getting antsy to see Leon headline a new adventure, not just retread old territory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, Capcom finally announced the highly anticipated Resident Evil: Requiem, and once again, the studio debuted a new protagonist: FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft. But if you look around the internet for information on Requiem, you’ll see the name of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1lbbsee/leon_s_kennedy_is_most_likely_going_to_be_in/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Leon S. Kennedy brought up so often</u></a> that you would think he was the main character of the upcoming game. That’s because rumors, both substantial and otherwise, claim that Leon will appear in Requiem in some capacity, whether that’s as a second protagonist, cameo, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-secretly-stars-leon-fans-believe-as-trailer-easter-eggs-and-actors-resume-potentially-point-to-his-return"><u>even the secret star</u></a>, depending on who you ask.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom, for its part, seems adamant that Grace Ashcroft is the face of Requiem, and there is enough information about her to believe this. Unlike Ethan Winters, who was a complete unknown when he debuted in Resident Evil 7, Grace Ashcroft is the daughter of journalist Alyssa Ashcroft, a playable character from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-forgotten-resident-evil-game-that-holds-the-secret-to-resident-evil-requiem"><u>Resident Evil Outbreak games</u></a>. This makes Grace something of a legacy character in her own right, giving her greater importance and stronger ties to the overall canon of the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, during the Capcom Showcase, Resident Evil: Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi directly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem"><u>addressed some of the online rumors</u></a> surrounding Leon Kennedy being the game’s secret protagonist, saying, “We always thought about making Leon the protagonist, but making a horror game based around him is difficult… No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview"><u>played a slice of Requiem</u></a>, I can confirm that Capcom is continuing the revised formula it introduced in Resident Evil 7 and putting a lot of emphasis on horror in the new game. One of the standout details is how Grace audibly reacts to different jump scares throughout the demo, which effectively ratchets up the tension. Nakanishi makes a good point about Leon being a bad match for this type of game: by this point in the series’ timeline, which is 30 years after the events of Resident Evil 2, Leon is a veteran who has no problems facing off against even the scariest monsters.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This makes Grace something of a legacy character in her own right, giving her greater importance and stronger ties to the overall canon of the series.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the decision to maintain the series’ real-time timeline feels designed to get fans used to the idea that their beloved characters face a ticking clock. Even if Leon Kennedy does appear in Resident Evil: Requiem, it’d be as a member of the old guard. After all, he will be around 50 years old when the events of Requiem take place, and while I’m sure he can still roundhouse kick a zombie at that age, having him age in real-time since his introduction in 1998 feels like a deliberate attempt to put Leon closer to retirement than in the thick of the action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think there’s plenty of room for Leon Kennedy to appear in Requiem as a seasoned veteran helping the new protagonist, similar to Chris’ role in Resident Evil Village. But the problem is how the Leon rumors have sucked up so much of the oxygen around Resident Evil: Requiem, so much so that some fans of the series are outright disregarding Grace as the game’s protagonist. There’s a good chance Leon could appear in Requiem, but Capcom’s attention to detail on Grace tells me that developers are quite passionate about her as a character. It must be a little frustrating to see fans brush her aside for an unconfirmed appearance by Leon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Leon and Resident Evil 4’s grip on the newest game isn’t just limited to which characters fans want to see. Resident Evil: Requiem made waves when it announced that, in an attempt to appeal to all Resident Evil fans, there will be the option to play Requiem in both the scarier first-person perspective introduced in Resident Evil 7, or in the iconic third-person perspective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My concern, and something I noted in my preview, is that switching between first- and third-person perspectives has an immediate impact on how scary the game is. That wider viewing angle reveals threats that would otherwise go unseen, spoiling jump scares and instilling additional fear-conquering confidence. And for a game that’s supposedly focused on horror, as Nakanishi claims, having an option that immediately dampens the terror feels like it undermines the director’s goals.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The last time Capcom chased the ghost of past Resident Evil games, it took years for the franchise to find its way back again.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like in the aftermath of Resident Evil 4, Capcom finds itself again in a position of balancing giving fans what they want, between the potential appearance of everyone’s favorite zombie-hunting agent and the choice to play in both first- and third-person, and pushing both the design of Resident Evil and the story of Raccoon City forward through the use of a new protagonist and contemporary timeframe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the developers of Requiem believe that the game can be scary and compelling in both first- and third-person, then I look forward to seeing that for myself next year. Similarly, if they feel that Grace Ashcroft can carry the next mainline Resident Evil game as the protagonist, I’m even more excited to find out how she fits into the story of Raccoon City. After successfully reinventing Resident Evil with Ethan Winters’ story and establishing a slower, creepier design that directly opposes the high-octane horror action of Leon’s trip to Spain, fans should extend Capcom the benefit of the doubt about Grace, Leon, and Requiem. And for the developers, I hope they pursue their vision for the Resident Evil franchise without compromise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because the last time Capcom chased the ghost of past Resident Evil games, it took years for the franchise to find its way back again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4-shadow-requiem-capcom-leon-kennedy-grace-ashcroft]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the time, when a young Pokémon fan steps out on their journey to see the world, they don't get to meet the pope, or introduce the head of the Catholic church to an imaginary creature that shares his name (sort of). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But reddit user ReptileCake, a Pokémon fan from Copenhagen, Denmark, has done just that — and got his trading card signed by the holy pontiff in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN, ReptileCake says he took two copies of a Popplio card to his meeting with Pope Leo XIV, which took place last Saturday, July 5 at the Vatican. One copy of the card, a holographic version, he got blessed by head of Catholicism. The other copy, meanwhile, he asked the pope to sign with a half-working Bic biro — the only pen ReptileCake belatedly realised he had with him. Happily, Pope Leo XIV agreed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">ReptileCake had travelled as part of a youth trip  to Italy alongside other students and teachers from across Europe. Many brought Pope Leo XIV gifts, or mementos for him to bless. But only ReptileCake brought Pope Leo a Popplio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I introduced it as Popplio because it sounds like Pope Leo," ReptileCake wrote on reddit earlier this week. "He laughed, probably as a courtesy, but he did know about Pokémon cards, he even showed it around to the guards around him. Then I asked him to sign a copy for me and he was happy to oblige."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a photo provided to IGN by the Vatican as proof of the encounter, the pontiff can indeed be seen smiling, highlighting the light-hearted nature of the exchange.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/08/01144-05072025-1751976720679.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">ReptileCake's Popplio and Pope Leo XIV. Image credit: Vatican Media</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was pretty chill," ReptileCake recalled of his day. "We were herded through security and then seated, then the pope arrived nonchalantly, gave a great speech about hope, and then invited everyone up for a meet and greet [for] people to get some items blessed or give gifts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I went up, gave him a Reverse Holo Popplio and then asked him to sign a copy for me, in which he complied with a laugh. He felt really nice to be around."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/08/h3y8oua088bf1-1751978321393.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">ReptileCake's now-signed Popplio card, with Pope Leo XIV's signature. Image credit: ReptileCake</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are many rare Pokémon cards in existence, ReptileCake's Popplio signed by Pope Leo XIV surely now ranks as one of the rarest — and potentially most valuable. Still, the card will not be going on sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's just a funny joke that his Holiness indulged in with me," ReptileCake concluded, "that's worth more than any monetary value can satisfy. "[I'm] never intending to get rid of the card in any way. It's a personal artefact that I will cherish for eternity."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seal Pokémon Popplio was best known, until now, for being one of the Starter creatures in the franchise's 7th generation games Pokémon Sun and Moon, originally launched in 2016 on Nintendo 3DS.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This Pokémon snorts body fluids from its nose, blowing ballons to smash into its foes," the creature's Pokédex description reads. "It's famous for being a hard worker."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pope Leo XIV, real name Robert Francis Prevost, is the first head of the Catholic Church to have been born in the US, and became pope in May 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Vatican Media</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
