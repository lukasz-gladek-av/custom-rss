The company launched a full Metroid Prime 1 remake back in 2023, but has since made no comment about continuing to relaunch the rest of the classic trilogy.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/27/bf4a1d73-f07a-4958-865c-4e9984e34f1b-optimization-1769506991960.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Walmart's Nintendo Switch Online poster, including Metroid Prime 2 and Pikmin 2. Image: Walmart/Nintendo</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with Metroid Prime 2: Echoes seemingly being added to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack catalogue, some fans have said their hopes of a remake have now dimmed. Others, meanwhile, have criticized the decision to simply re-release the game's original GameCube version when its Wii re-release included some notable balance changes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I am very glad we are getting Prime 2, but I was really hoping for a remake like Prime 1," wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qo2t44/new_nso_games_leaked_via_walmartcom_promo_material/o1yg865/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pojosamaneo</a>. "Prime 2 is incredible, and deserves a remake."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Prime 2 being an NSO game isn't just not preferable over getting the remaster treatment, but because the OG GameCube release is rough," wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qo2t44/new_nso_games_leaked_via_walmartcom_promo_material/o1yg8d0/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mymouthiscancerous</a>. "It has insane difficulty spikes with bosses like Spider Guardian and Boost Guardian which were only rectified with the Wii port as part of Metroid Prime Trilogy. It's the same reason why Nintendo just plopping Wind Waker on NSO instead of porting HD just sucks when there's an objectively better version out there stuck in Wii U purgatory."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pikmin 2 already got its own Switch remaster, of course, launched back in 2023.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time a retailer has leaked upcoming Nintendo Switch Online games before Nintendo itself has made them official. Back in October last year, fellow GameCube addition Luigi's Mansion was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ocsm98/promotional_pamphlet_for_nintendo_switch_2/?share_id=VV2sqow817w3-YG8yVNl5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaked</a> by Target, just prior to Nintendo confirming its arrival to its subscription service.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As expectation mounts for a full Nintendo Direct in February, it may not be long until Metroid Prime 2 and Pikmin 2 are also made official.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before all that, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-announced-for-this-week-focused-on-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream">there is another Nintendo Direct this week</a> — focused on upcoming Switch social sim Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream. This will come just days after last weekend's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Direct that debuted a new Super Mario Galaxy Movie trailer</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

"One example of this was the excessively low turnover rate, leading to a clear lack of senior/lead-level staff with experience developing online/mobile/F2P games.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Additionally, as a French-first company establishing branches outside French-speaking regions to build a global development structure, they faced management issues unique to non-English global corporations."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When contacted by IGN for a response, Ubisoft declined to comment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft Osaka was shut down a year ago, impacting 134 staff, including Shimoda. Previously, the team had worked as a support studio, and had contributed to Shadows' development. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Less than a week after announcing its sweeping company reorganization, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-follows-last-weeks-game-cancelations-and-studio-closures-with-a-proposed-reduction-of-200-more-jobs-at-its-paris-headquarters">Ubisoft has proposed a reduction in headcount of around 200 people based at its headquarters in Paris</a>.
