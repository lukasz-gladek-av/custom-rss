But fans had wondered whether the patch had more to it than Arrowhead let on, given it weighed in at over 5GB. Perhaps the terrain deformation / dig system now in the game was a big part of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are now digging into the detail of this new shovel, trying to work out how deep they can go and whether it has any other use. Can it be used to dig under doors, for example? Can players work together to create trenches? The community is having fun working this out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Arrowhead announced Helldivers 2’s next premium warbond, dubbed Servants of Freedom. The battle pass due out February 6 adds a portable Hellbomb stratagem and new armor that come with the Integrated Explosives passive, which means that upon death, your corpse will detonate and take out the enemies around you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
