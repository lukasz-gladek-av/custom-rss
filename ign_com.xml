            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/help-us-rank-the-biggest-games-from-summer-of-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">All the big summer presentations are now complete, which means we now have a pretty clear picture as to what games we’ll be playing over the next year or so. Across IGN’s Summer of Gaming we’ve seen plenty of exciting reveals, from the debut of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> as part of Summer Game Fest (arriving next February!) to the big <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clockwork-revolution">Clockwork Revolution</a> trailer during the Xbox Games Showcase (which launches… when it launches.) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With more than a dozen presentations held over the last few weeks, there has been at least a little something for everyone. Cozy gamers found games to love among the trailers featured in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS_nFj3inRw&amp;ab_channel=IGN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wholesome Direct</a>, fans of the grimdark future got excited about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-returns-space-marine-master-crafted-edition-and-more-all-the-announcements-and-trailers-from-warhammer-skulls-2025">Warhammer Skulls</a>, and first-party devotees feasted on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">PlayStation’s State of Play</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. But with everything now out in the wild, it’s time for the hard work: to rank the biggest reveals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve selected the 25 biggest games of the season, based on a multitude of factors (including trailer and page views, social media chatter, and staff excitement) and entered them into a Tier List. Where each of those 25 games sits on the Tier List is up to you. S rank is for the most exciting, D rank is for the games you think show little promise, and then there’s space for everything else in between. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the 25 games are many that have an easy shot at hitting S rank. Resident Evil Requiem proved itself as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-trailers-of-summer-of-gaming">biggest, most-watched trailer of the season</a>, and our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview">hands-on preview</a> suggests it's certainly one to watch. And how about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/invincible-vs">Invincible VS</a>, which looks like a fantastic tag-team fighter as well as a pitch-perfect adaptation of the beloved comics? Then there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> with its cinematic first trailer – but will the Bond film vibes be matched by worthy gameplay? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other games are tricker to rank. We finally, after years of waiting, saw Capcom’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, but does it look as exciting as you’d hoped it would? How about the announcement of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-1-remake-officially-in-development-at-bloober-team-konami-has-announced">Silent Hill remake</a>? We’ve not seen a second of it, but it <em>is</em> being developed by Bloober Team, who knocked it out the park with its Silent Hill 2 remake. And then there’s sentient lighthouse simulator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/keeper">Keeper</a>, Double Fine’s long-awaited return, but its debut trailer seemed to keep at least a few cards close to its chest. Where will all these games (and more) rank? It's up to you to decide. </p><div id="summer-of-gaming-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Summer of Gaming Tier List</h3><h3>Summer of Gaming Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from IGN's Summer of Gaming, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-most-anticipated-games-from-summer-of-gaming">most anticipated games of the season</a>, as well as this month's IGN First, which is all about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a>. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I've leveled up, I've got lots of juice, and a cool sword, and stuff like that, and I just throw myself at them again, and again, and again, and again.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That was the technique I learned with Dark Souls," he continued. “It's not that you get better, it's more like monkeys and typewriters. You just keep doing it, and eventually, one day they're dead.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it turns out, Garland never had quite the trouble with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Starscourge_Radahn_Location_and_Boss_Fight_Guide">Starscourge Radahn</a>, instead offering his very own game help guide on how to take down the gravity magic-harnessing horseman.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Radahn's really easy”, stated Garland. “I thought Radahn was quite easy, because as long as you sort of activated the people who can assist you in that fight, they get on with fighting him, and they take off whatever it is, half his energy, and you finish him off. It's all about activating those little summon signs dotted around.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Can we expect either of these bosses to appear in A24's upcoming Elden Ring film adaptation? Well, as you may expect, Garland gave us no details on what he plans to do with the project. Indeed, we know next to nothing about the Elden Ring movie, which is in the works from Garland as writer and director, Elden Ring publisher Bandai Namco, and A24. Game of Thrones author George R. R. Martin, who helped create the original Elden Ring, is attached as a producer on the movie, as is Vince Gerardis. DNA’s Peter Rice will also produce, along with Andrew Macdonald and Allon Reich from DNA. There’s no word yet on how involved FromSoftware or game director Hidetaka Miyazaki will be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What do you think the story of the Elden Ring movie should be? I, for one, think it would be smart to tackle a prequel based on the events of The Shattering, rather than the story of the game itself. Got your own idea? Let us know in the comments below!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

That, however, isn’t always possible. Why? The developer of an upcoming Terminator video game has offered an explanation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/terminator-2d-no-fate">Terminator 2D: No Fate</a>, due out this September, is a retro game based on 1991 action masterpiece <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/terminator-2-judgment-day">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a>. It features iconic characters from the movie, such as John and Sarah Connor, the T-1000 and the T-800. Check out gameplay and comments from the developers at Bitmap Bureau in the video below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But while Terminator 2D: No Fate <em>does</em> feature the T-1000 and the T-800 characters, it does not feature Arnie’s likeness. Speaking to IGN, publisher Reef Entertainment explained why, and in the process lifted the lid on how licenses like these tend to work for video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reef, with the Terminator 2 license to play with, has the rights to use the characters from the movie such as Sarah and John Connor, and on top of that, it has image rights for certain actors who have provided those rights to Studio Canal, which owns the rights to the first two Terminator films, as part of the agreement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the rights to use the Terminator itself does not include the rights to use Arnie's likeness. That’s why Terminator 2D: No Fate uses the endoskeleton for character artwork, rather than Arnie’s likeness.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/18/gettyimages-1203004081-1750236768610.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Michael Edwards as Old John Connor. Photo by CBS via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As well as all that, Reef got in touch with Michael Edwards, the actor who played General John Connor in the iconic opening of Terminator 2, to do a likeness deal for the video game. Terminator 2D: No Fate includes gameplay that sees the player control future war John Connor in a fight against the machines, fleshing out that brief opening scene in the movie into an entire section of the video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the movie, you only see Edwards’ John Connor for a few seconds, but those seconds are memorable indeed; his heavily scarred face and steely gaze looking out over the battlefield tell us he’s seen and done all sorts in humanity’s desperate struggle for survival against the machines. So Reef reached out separately to the 80-year-old actor to do a deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(It turns out that in 2021, Edwards reprised the role of John Connor in a fan-made Terminator film called <a href="https://youtu.be/tF89pdWxaZw?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skynet</a>.)</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/18/screenshot-2025-06-18-095636-1750237011381.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Michael Edwards reprised the role of John Connor in 2021 fan film Skynet. Image credit: Blinky Productions Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In short: there’s a difference between signing the Terminator 2 license and having the agreement to use the characters, compared to the actor’s likeness, which is separate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t to say it is impossible to get Arnie’s likeness for use in video games. After all, Mortal Kombat developer NetherRealm has managed it multiple times, most recently for Mortal Kombat 1’s DLC character Conan the Barbarian. Before that, NetherRealm managed to get Arnie for the Terminator T-800 DLC character in Mortal Kombat 11. But there’s a gulf between the scope of a game like Terminator 2D: No Fate and the Warner Bros.-backed Mortal Kombat series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s worth noting that while NetherRealm’s Arnie likeness is in, a soundalike voice actor (Chris Cox) was used for his lines. It doesn’t look like the 77-year-old Schwarzenegger is in the business of doing video game voice work.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Reed Entertainment’s comment to IGN on how all this works in full:</p><blockquote>Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't in the game it’s just a T800. We didn't have his license, unfortunately. But for the rest, you have to ask each actor individually to use his portrait.</blockquote><blockquote>What we have is the right to use the characters. So like Sarah, John, T1000, T800, and then certain actors will also provide image rights to Studio Canal, which is included in the agreement. For example; Linda Hamilton is Sarah Connor, which is why you can see Linda at the beginning of the trailer. Whereas our right to use the Terminator itself, it doesn't include Arnold. When you see the character artwork for that, you'll see it's like the Terminator itself rather than Arnold. It's basically the endoskeleton that we have the right to use.</blockquote><blockquote>Michael Edwards played the future war version of John in the opening of T2. You see him, he lowers his binoculars, he's looking over the battlefield. Someone like that, we reached out separately to him to include his likeness. There's a definite difference between signing the T2 license and having the agreement to use the characters compared to the actor's likeness, which is separate.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by CBS via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

There is also, as it turns out, a limit on just how many you can have stored up in your hideaway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1ldjmds/you_cant_play_if_you_have_too_many_relics/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One user on the r/Nightreign subreddit</a> posted an image from their Elden Ring Nightreign game today, with a special message appearing over their attempts to start an expedition. "Cannot launch expedition: Too many relics in possession," read the message. "Please use the relic rite menu to sell off spares."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The user u/Scufozzover1 didn't specify exactly how many they had, only <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1ldjmds/you_cant_play_if_you_have_too_many_relics/my8yo5m/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ball-parking an estimate</a> of "upwards of 1000 maybe." It's easy to theorize this might be related to a general 999 item limit, but unless you'd like to grind out that many relics, it's unclear where the limit actually is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of reasons to clear out your relic storage, mostly for resources. Though if you're just playing run after run of Elden Ring Nightreign I could see losing track of just how many you've accrued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Comments in the thread have brought up an old critique of Elden Ring Nightreign: the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1ld2tlg/this_game_is_in_dire_need_of_a_better_relic/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">need for relic management</a>. As more relics flood in, it can become a little difficult to keep track of what's what, or adding additional filters that could better sift through the pile.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's already a bit of a hassle for me now, as I've built up a decent stockpile of basic relics, so I can't imagine what it's like for this Redditor and their apparent hundreds upon hundreds of relics. Maybe this won't be an issue for most players now, but as the weeks and months of Nightreign roll on, it might be worth keeping an eye on. At the very least, it's a good reminder to clean out your unused relics every now and then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
