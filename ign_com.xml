Amid all the new tricks and modes, Nintendo also confirmed a slew of new and returning tracks and racers for Mario Kart World.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the course side, there were several new courses shown off as part of the roamable world. From the streets of Crown City to the water of Salty Salty Speedway, there are plenty of places to explore and shortcuts to discover. Mechanics like wall-riding and grinding seem like they'll add quite a bit for players to uncover. Here's what we spotted in today's Direct.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mario Kart World Confirmed Courses Shown in Today's Direct</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Mario Bros. Circuit</li><li>Crown City</li><li>Salty Salty Speedway</li><li>Starview Peak</li><li>Boo Cinema</li><li>Toad's Factory</li><li>Peach Beach</li><li>Wario Shipyard</li><li>Whistletop Summit</li><li>DK Spaceport</li><li>Desert Hills</li><li>Shy Guy Bazaar</li><li>Wario Stadium</li><li>Airship Fortress</li><li>DK Pass</li><li>Sky-High Sundae</li><li>Koopa Troopa Beach</li><li>Faraway Oasis</li><li>Crown City</li><li>Peach Stadium</li><li>Dino Dino Jungle</li><li>Great ? Block Ruins</li><li>Rainbow Road</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">But what's a world full of courses without a universe's worth of racers to speed across them? Mario Kart World looks to be making some deep pulls from Mario's history. The usual suspects of Mario, Peach, Luigi, and Yoshi are joined by the likes of Spike, Conkdor, Penguin, and more. Here's everyone we spotted in a kart during today's Mario Kart World Direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World Confirmed Racers From Today's Direct</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Mario</li><li>Luigi</li><li>Peach</li><li>Daisy</li><li>Rosalina</li><li>Pauline</li><li>Yoshi</li><li>Toad</li><li>Koopa Troopa</li><li>Baby Mario</li><li>Baby Luigi</li><li>Baby Peach</li><li>Baby Daisy</li><li>Baby Rosalina</li><li>Wario</li><li>Waluigi</li><li>Bowser</li><li>Goomba</li><li>Spike</li><li>Cow</li><li>Lakitu</li><li>Toadette</li><li>Bowser Jr.</li><li>Birdo</li><li>King Boo</li><li>Shy Guy</li><li>Donkey Kong</li><li>Nabbit</li><li>Pirahna Plant</li><li>Hammer Bro</li><li>Monty Mole</li><li>Sidestepper</li><li>Cheep Cheep</li><li>Dry Bones</li><li>Wiggler</li><li>Cataquack</li><li>Pianta</li><li>Rocky Wrench</li><li>Conkdor</li><li>Chargin' Chuck</li><li>Penguin</li><li>Stingby</li><li>Swoop</li><li>Dolphin</li><li>Para-Biddybud</li><li>Pokey</li><li>Coin Coffer</li><li>Peepa</li><li>Snowman</li><li>Fish Bone</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">It's quite a line-up so far, and will probably only expand as we learn more about this game. Today's Mario Kart World Direct went over everything from Grand Prix and Knockout Mode to the camera-fueled social options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World is set to arrive on the Nintendo Switch 2's launch day, June 5, as an exclusive for the newest Switch console. There certainly seems to be quite a bit to do here, which will hopefully measure up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">to its $80 price tag</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-direct-everything-announced-for-the-switch-2-launch-title<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo shared with us a Mario Kart World Direct and it revealed much more about the launch title for the Nintendo Switch, including new details on characters, courses, races, secrets, and so much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This roundup has gathered everything you need to know about this Mario Kart World Direct and we hope it will help with the wait until this much-anticipated game launches alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Courses</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World will feature a ton of new and old courses on its interconnected map, and we were introduced to a few of them today, including Mario Bros. Circuit, Crown City, Salty Salty Speedway, Starview Peak, Boo Cinema, Toad's Factory, Peach Beach, and Wario Shipyard. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What should be most exciting for returning Mario Kart players is that the older courses have been "reimagined to feel at-home within this vast, new world, offering fresh experiences on classics." </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Characters and New Techniques</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering up to 24 racers can compete in one race, Mario Kart World will need a lot of characters to ensure everyone doesn't play the same one. While there are sure to be more added and revealed, this Direct featured such characters as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, Baby Peach, Baby Daisy, Baby Rosalina, Rosalina, Koopa, Rocky Wrench, Conkdor, Goomba, Spike, Cow, King Boo, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Waluigi, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Birdo, Bowser Jr., Lakitu, Toad, Wario, Pauline, Toadette, Shy Guy, Nabbit, Piranha Plant, Hammer Bro, Monty Mole, Dry Bones, Wiggler, Cataquack, Pianta, Sidestepper, and Cheep Cheep.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Driving with these characters will be even more fun this time around as there are new techniques to utilize. Charge Jump gives racers a chance to dodge enemy attacks, reach higher places and rails that can be grinded on, and even jump towards a wall to ride on it for a short time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most exciting new additions is Rewind, as it will let players try again to reach a hidden path or take a turn better or whatever! However, it is important to note that rivals will still move normally if you rewind so you could find yourself in even more trouble if you aren't careful.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Kart World Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Races - Grand Prix and Knockout Tour</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two main modes in Mario Kart World - Grand Prix and Knockout Tour. Grand Prix will be the mode fans are used to as players will need to compete in multiple races to win the Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup, Flower Cup, and more. However, this time around players will drive from course to course instead of exiting out to a menu, which should make for a much more seamless experience thanks to Mario Kart World's more open structure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you happen to conquer all of the Grand Prix Cups, a certain "colorful course" may appear which sure sounds like Rainbow Road. It won't be easy though, as there will be new obstacles like cars that shoot bullet bills and Hammer Bros. that throw their namesake hammers!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Knockout Tour is a battle-royale-esque mode where you have to race from one side of Mario Kart World's map to the other. The only catch is you have to be in a certain place at each checkpoint or you will be knocked out of the race. The winner will be the last driver standing in the Golden Rally, Ice Rally, and more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mario Kart World Free Roam</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In Mario Kart World's Free Roam mode, players will be able to drive wherever they'd like without the worry of trying to be in first place. As you explore, you will discover things like P Switches (hundreds of them!) that will activate blue coins you'll need to collect and start missions. These missions will be challenges that will improve your skills outside of races.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There will also be hidden coins like Peach Medallions, hidden panels, and much more. Oh, and there is a photo mode in Free Roam that will be available to always capture that perfect moment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Visiting Yoshi's restaurant will also be a joy as you can pick up "Dash Food" that will give you a boost of speed and an outfit inspired by your meal! Some examples shown were a cheeseburger, sushi, skewers, chips, roasted meat, pizza, ice cream, and more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Playing Mario Kart World with Friends</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing Mario Kart World with friends will undoubtedly be one of the best ways to play this racing game, and Nintendo is giving players a ton of options in how they can do that. Such options include having four players play on one system, local wireless play with up to eight players (two systems of four), and up to 24 players from around the world playing in Online Play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another big feature in Mario Kart World is allowing players to free roam with their friends in between races. Players will be able to see where their friends are on the map and fast travel to them for some fun. You can then battle or race with custom rules or just explore the map with them. Photo Mode will also be available for friends!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GameChat will also be an integral part of Mario Kart World as players will be able to talk to their friends and even see their reactions live on video for those who have a comptabile camera. If all players are on a single system, the camera can even detect up to four faces.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Modes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the modes we mentioned above, players will be able to jump into Time Trials, where there will also be an option to go online and race against ghost data of others around the world. VS Mode is next and it offers a ton of customization, including the option to compete with up to four different teams of racers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle Mode is back as well, and it includes such coompetitions as Coin Runners and Balloon Battle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Items</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While there will be familiar items returning to Mario Kart like Bullet Bill and Lightning, there will also be some new additions like the Coin Shell that can knock rivals off course and provide a trail of coins for players to collect. There will also be an Ice Flower to freeze enemies, Hammers to attack enemies and block their paths, a Mega Mushroom that will grow players to monstrous heights, a Feather that will let players jump to avoid attacks, and even a Kamek item that will call in the classic character to transform players into something mysterious.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Support Features</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World is aiming to be a game for players of all skill levels, and to reach that goal Nintendo is including some support features to help like Smart Steering, Tilt Controls (Joy-Con 2 wheel compatible!), Auto-Use Item, Auto-Accelerate, and the ability to adjust both the Vertical and Horizontal Camera.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">hands-on preview of Mario Kart World,</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">how Nintendo is justifying its $80 price tag,</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen">our big Nintendo Switch 2 interview with Nintendo's Bill Trinen</a> to learn more about the console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.
