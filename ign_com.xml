And at the Game Developers Conference last week, IGN learned at least one mystery it won’t explain: the base game’s buck-wild twist of a final cutscene.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who haven’t yet finished Lies of P, here’s the spoiler-free version: there’s a cutscene that plays at the end of the game that seems to suggest where Neowiz might be taking the Lies of P universe next. It’s a pretty wild twist of a scene, which has left fans speculating how it might be implemented and whether we’ll get an explanation in the DLC. However, Lies of P director Jiwon Choi confirmed that this cutscene isn’t DLC-related. All he’d say beyond that was, “Please stay tuned for additional announcements in the future.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/26/lies-of-p-overture-conceptart-glasshouse-wm-1743004263842.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Concept art for Lies of P: Overture</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Neowiz has already announced a full-blown sequel to Lies of P, which means it’s likely this cutscene is instead related to that. But we don’t really know any details about Lies of P 2 either, just that it’s being worked on. And Choi wouldn’t share any sequel hints in our chat with him, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I can certainly tell you is when we share such news or media and assets with you, you'll know for sure that we are ready to present it to you. And that follows very our strict focus on quality [amid] all the pressure that we talked about in the past. So that is the one promise that I can share with you, that when we actually share those contents with you and the news, we will be ready to share that with you.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE ENDING OF LIES OF P. READ BELOW THE VIDEO AT YOUR OWN RISK.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The scene we’re referring to that we asked Choi about is, of course, the Dorothy scene. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spoiler-warning-lies-of-ps-post-credits-scene-hints-at-a-surprising-sequel"><u>wrote about this in detail here</u></a>, but the short version is that the game’s final cutscene depicts Paracelcus speaking to someone on the phone, eventually mentioning that he will “find her, for sure. Another key of ours: Dorothy.” We’re then shown the unmistakable striped sock legs and ruby slippers of Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz, suggesting that whatever comes next for Lies of P, it will tie into other public domain “fairy tales”. But we still don’t know how or why, and we now also know it won’t be in Overture.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>SPOILERS END HERE.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We did manage to glean a few hints about what <em>will</em> be in the DLC. Choi recommends that while they want for Overture, Lies of P fans should replay the base game, as there are clues in the world of the game already that suggest what might be coming:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you play through the base game again, you'll see many hints that we scattered throughout the whole experience,” Choi said. “A lot of hints and a lot of windows into the world, and you'll be able to actually see that and experience that in expansion…There are many things that I actually wanted to accomplish when we were working on the base game. It didn't get put into the base game, and all of that, at least key elements of that are going to be included in expansion.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/26/lies-of-p-overture-conceptart-carnivaltent-wm-1743004238316.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Concept art for Lies of P: Overture</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He adds that some fans are already onto Neowiz’s tricks, saying that he regularly reads fan theories online and that “some of them are quite close.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also learned a few other tidbits: Choi told us that the DLC should take roughly between 15-20 hours to complete “for experienced players” and will become available to players once they’ve passed a “certain” chapter of the game, and then accessible all the way to the end. And we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-overture-revealed-during-sony-state-of-play-2025"><u>know from the game’s announcement</u></a> that the DLC is technically a “prequel”, with the main character getting transported back in time to Krat just before its fall. The DLC will feature new locations, new enemies and bosses, new characters, and new weapons – though again, Choi was keen on keeping the details on these a surprise for the release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/quite-a-ride-a-survival-horror-game-set-on-a-bike-announced-for-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Goodwin Games has announced a new survival horror game for PC called Quite a Ride. Built with Unreal Engine 5, you must keep pedaling on your bike in order to keep the fog around you – and the horrors within it – from consuming you. It doesn't have a release date as of yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Goodwin describes it, "You travel by bicycle through a foggy rural landscape filled with eerie secrets and monsters lurking in the dense mist. The game's atmosphere and themes draw inspiration from Stephen King's works and iconic horror films of the '80s and '90s." Check out the announcement trailer above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Quite a Ride - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Your phone's battery drains over time and must be recharged by continuing to pedal your bike. And that phone will keep sending you strange messages that might help or hurt you. Meanwhile, as you go, you'll encounter oddities like deserted towns and bizarre laboratories. The road is always changing, but Goodwin says there's a unique pseudo-multiplayer twist: "Players' collective global efforts can change the environment, unlocking new locations, hidden characters and secret quests over time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3166050/Quite_a_Ride/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wishlist</a> Quite a Ride on Steam if you're interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.
