            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-developer-is-formulating-a-plan-to-improve-pvp-and-toxic-deep-desert-experiences<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In its first Q&amp;A since Dune: Awakening launched on June 10, developer Funcom responded to questions on what's next for its survival MMO, and in particular changes due to come to its endgame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Funcom <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lehj35/official_dune_awakening_launch_ama_with_funcom/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a> it's "currently formulating a plan" to improve PvP in the Deep Desert, which players have previously branded as "toxic" due to griefing. Funcom has already <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-patches-out-orni-squishing-in-pvp-by-completely-removing-the-ability-to-damage-players-and-npcs-with-vehicles-and-not-all-fans-are-happy-about-it"><u>patched out the ability for players to squish other people with their Ornithopter</u></a>, but senior game director Viljar Sommerbakk also revealed the team was considering tweaking Ornis further, such as equipping them with rockets that "reduces overall maneuverability and max speed". </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team is also considering making Scout Orni rockets cost slightly more heat to fire, something Sommerbakk said would limit its combat usefulness relative to the Assault Ornithopter "while still allowing it to be an aerial threat." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have a lot of plans to address [players'] points about respawn times and revives," creative director Joel Bylos added. "Full loot is a decree that can be obtained via the Landsraad (so compete there if you want to make it a reality), there are control points in the deep desert already, we have no plans to reduce the DD size. As we work on the game, we will continue to work on making PvP more rewarding (I am sure you will note I am not being very concrete but that is because we are planning and watching how people are playing and finding the right points to address)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lead producer Ole Andreas Hayley said: "The Deep Desert will always stay a PvP free-for-all area, but we might consider adding other locations that offer factional warfare."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want players to make meaningful decisions about what they bring with them and how they outfit their vehicles," Sommerbakk continued. "Once players have engaged in PvP, we want the experience to be reliable, responsive, and clearly understood. This determines how PvP as a whole feels and how players make their moment-to-moment decisions in a fight. To ensure a more reliable experience in ground combat, we are continuing to address issues with movement desyncs and rubber banding, as well as ability activation reliability."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also some quality of life tweaks on the way, too, including named storage containers and vehicles, to help you differentiate, as well as "deposit/extract all" buttons for water storages and the like. We should also expect boss encounters as part of future dungeons as the team continues to evolve PvE content. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dune: Awakening Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Hayley also teased that we could receive additional maps in the future, also.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Dune universe has a lot of interesting locations and worlds to explore, and we're looking forward to continuing to build on top of the foundation we have," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, there are no plans to make it easier to distinguish between NPCs and other players — "this is in line with the vision of the game" — and when asked if it would be possible to skip all dialogue and animations, Bylos said: "Absolutely not."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-dev-working-on-pvp-and-deep-desert-issues-as-new-concurrent-user-peak-record-is-set"><u>Dune: Awakening a Great 8/10 in our review</u></a>, writing: "Dune: Awakening is an excellent survival MMO that captures Frank Herbet’s sci-fi world incredibly well, mostly to its advantage and occasionally to its detriment. The survival climb from dehydrated peasant to powerful warlord of Arrakis is a joy almost every step of the way, and the story and worldbuilding filled this nerd with absolute joy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There’s still plenty for Awakening to work on though, as its combat never really hits its stride, the endgame is a bit of a chaotic mess not worth the effort, and there’s quite a few technical bugs yet to be squashed, but even these rough patches felt like tiny desert mice next to the leviathan shai-huluds that are this survival game’s wonderful successes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dune: Awakening has enjoyed a superb launch, with a 'very positive' user review rating on Steam. Within hours of going live on June 10, Funcom's survival MMO had clocked up over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-one-of-the-most-played-games-on-steam-as-peak-concurrent-player-numbers-hit-new-heights"><u>142,000 concurrent players on Valve's platform</u></a>, and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>hit a new high over the weekend of 189,333 players</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If all that's got you interested, make sure to check out all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dune-awakening/Classes"><u>Dune: Awakening classes</u></a> you can choose from, and keep an eye on our in-progress <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dune-awakening/Dune_Awakening_Walkthrough"><u>Dune: Awakening walkthrough</u></a> for a step-by-step guide to the story.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/confused-nintendo-fans-spot-giant-metroid-prime-4-beyond-advert-stating-that-the-game-is-out-now-sparking-hopes-of-an-imminent-release<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Nintendo has confirmed to IGN that the Metroid Prime 4: Beyond advert currently at Oxford Circus in London is incorrect, and the game still lacks an official release date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We can confirm that the 'Out Now' message on this advert is incorrect," a Nintendo spokesperson said. "Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition are not yet available and are scheduled for release in 2025."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has been able to verify the advert currently remains in place at the station — as detailed in our original report below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ORIGINAL STORY:</strong> A giant advert for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond at London's Oxford Circus tube station states that the game is now available, sparking confusion from Nintendo fans on their morning commute.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First off, if you've seen the advert yourself, no — the current London heatwave hasn't melted your senses. The advert, now spotted by multiple fans and confirmed in person by IGN staff, really does say the game is "out now".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, Nintendo has not announced a Metroid Prime 4: Beyond release date other than a vague promise it will launch this year. But even if the game isn't out now, its appearance on an advert in such a prominent location is giving Nintendo fans hope its launch is right around the corner.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Any idea why the MP4 Beyond ad in the London Underground says 'out now'?" Nintendo fan orchestar  wrote on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1lfnbga/metroid_prime_4_ad_in_london_underground_out_now/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>. "I’m genuinely confused. Do they mean the Switch 2 is out? I wish the game was truly out though haha."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have speculated that the advert is perhaps outdated — maybe Nintendo did initially plan to launch Metroid Prime 4 now, and the wording wasn't updated? Alternatively, we could be seeing a version of the advert not due until later, alongside the game's actual release date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For other Nintendo fans, keen to play the game soon after many years of waiting, the advert has sparked hope of a surprise release. This does seem unlikely, however, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-confirms-super-mario-odysseys-pauline-is-your-new-sidekick-and-dk-can-now-transform-into-a-zebra-or-flying-ostrich">Donkey Kong Bananza firmly positioned as Nintendo's next big Switch 2 title</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As IGN senior commerce editor Rob Anderson told me this morning, reporting from the scene, the whole of this Oxford Circus tube platform is one long Nintendo Switch 2 advert, with individual panels for games such as Super Mario Party Jamboree, Donkey Kong Bananza and the Switch 2 console itself. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's placement here, then, looks just to be part of a wider promotional campaign — rather than a specific placement for the individual game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Nintendo for comment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/20/pxl-20250620-103943003-1750416263852.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is "out now", according to this Oxford Circus advert. Image credit: IGN</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now a cross-gen title for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is set to finally arrive at some point in 2025 after a long and eventful development. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally announced back in 2017, the follow-up to Retro Studios' beloved GameCube and Wii trilogy was rebooted in 2019, and development restarted by Retro Studios after an earlier version in the works at Bandai Namco failed to meet Nintendo's standards. Years later, with Switch 2 on the horizon, Nintendo finally gave the game a proper unveiling in June 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Switch 2, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will run at 120 frames per second and offer optional controls that take advantage of the Joy-Con's mouse feature. It seems most likely to arrive at some point between Donkey Kong Bananza's July launch and Pokémon Legends: Z-A's arrival in October.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo credit: Rob Anderson</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
