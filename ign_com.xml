            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox developers have been addressing disgruntled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> players who have questioned the need to nerf overpowered builds in the mostly single-player looter shooter, saying it’s necessary to preserve the challenge and encourage build “diversity.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes as players brace themselves for the end of builds that rely on what the community has dubbed 'the crit knife,' <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-is-your-7-days-notice-borderlands-4-dev-warns-those-insane-boss-melting-builds-based-on-unintended-interactions-arent-long-for-this-world">an "unintended interaction” Gearbox has said will be nerfed this week</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4"><u>Borderlands 4</u></a> is rife with overpowered builds that cause massive damage, even to the game’s toughest bosses on the hardest difficulties. The most infamous of these is the crit knife, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-says-its-prioritizing-the-first-round-of-buffs-over-patching-out-instakill-knife-builds-but-it-will-eventually-address-unintended-interactions"><u>which Gearbox has said it’s aware of</u></a>. But there are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-youtuber-tries-to-nerf-proof-their-character-instead-stumbles-upon-what-is-almost-certainly-an-unintended-interaction-that-does-so-much-damage-it-causes-bosses-total-existence-failure"><u>many others</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The nerf sweep set to hit Borderlands 4 has sparked a debate within the game’s community about the rights and wrongs of balance changes such as these in single-player games. With no PvP component, Borderlands 4 is mostly about solo players — and occasional groups of co-op players — farming bosses for loot that makes their build ever so slightly better each time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-want-to-know-what-sort-of-odds-i-am-trying-to-beat-when-i-am-grinding-a-game-150-hours-and-over-3000-boss-kills-later-a-superfan-has-worked-out-borderlands-4s-disappointingly-low-drop-rate"><u>IGN recently interviewed a Borderlands 4 player who spent 150 hours on over 3,000 boss kills to find out the game’s true drop rate</u></a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Builds based on the crit knife, for example, can essentially delete bosses even on Borderlands 4’s toughest difficulty, making farming for loot a trivial endeavor. Some believe there’s nothing wrong with such overpowered play because players aren't competing with others in any way. Others argue it’s bad for the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this debate isn’t isolated to Borderlands 4. I’ve seen it crop up over the years in countless loot games, from Diablo to Destiny. But it always presents a tricky balancing act from developers who want to keep their players happy while also sticking to their guns in their response.</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“What is the problem with these interactions in a mostly single-player experience? There's no pvp where it gives an unfair advantage,” <a href="https://x.com/F8ED_Media/status/1976722632956424283" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked one player on social media</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nerfs in a single-player experience is a s***-ass take and all of the ones asking for it should be ashamed, is that people can't have fun?

The gun builds that use the crit knife have other options and will have more options coming soon.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Timmins then chimed in on the crit knife, <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1977748287001182653" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a>: “Our intent is always to expand the number of builds, so any adjustment we make is in service of that goal.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1o2t1yl/honestly_i_love_this_dev_team/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Most in the community appear to agree with Gearbox’s stance on this</a>, calling the nerfs necessary if Borderlands 4 wants to survive as a live service game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They can't release Invincibles in a context where absurdly overpowered stuff that one-shot bosses exist,” said redditor LascarCapable. “Otherwise people will just gravitate towards the few builds that can do it, the same pieces of gear, and everything else will be irrelevant. Also, it would make the game a borefest; it's funny five minutes to one-shot bosses, but beyond that point it just removes all the fun of the main gameplay loop.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a game like Borderlands 4, which has billions of guns and enormous scope for varied builds, fans will always find ways to generate enough damage that makes a mockery of boss fights. The question for Gearbox will be how it manages those builds, while taking care not to come across as the fun police.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is something Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead has struggled with as it works to maintain the challenge in its explosive co-op shooter while also preserving the fun. It’s fair to say the studio hasn’t always got it right, leading to discontent within its community and, on occasion, apologies from its developers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are now on Gearbox to see what changes it has in store for not just Borderlands 4’s crit knife build, but any build it believes relies on an “unintended interaction.” A major patch is expected soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the weekend, Gearbox revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-reveals-bounty-pack-1-how-rush-saved-mercenary-day-the-first-seasonal-mini-event-an-invincible-boss-and-more">Borderlands 4 Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, the first seasonal mini-event for the game, the aforementioned Invincible boss</a>, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> launched to impressive player numbers just last week, but EA’s latest entry in the long-running FPS series is facing one issue that has players missing more shots than they should be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As players across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S poured into Battlefield 6 in the days following its October 10 launch, they were met with a launch build that holds up much better than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/04/dices-plan-to-fix-battlefield-4s-online-issues"><u>some of the more infamous launches of the franchise’s past</u></a>. It’s not been without its problems, though, with one particularly annoying bug seemingly affecting hit registration for some guns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Only a few clips analyzing the issue have managed to bubble to the top of online discussion, but each has drawn more examples from other individuals faced with the same issue. Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o4eams/alright_which_one_of_you_loaded_up_my_rifle_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>KaiKamakasi</u></a> was one of the first to bring their concerns to the table, showing a clip from Battlefield 6’s New Sobek City map that sees them firing more than 20 bullets directly into an enemy and getting nothing to show for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They joke that someone must have loaded their rifle with blanks, but the video seems to be especially damning evidence that something else is afoot in Battlefield 6. Each shot seems lined up perfectly with the enemy, so much so that blood can even be seen spurting out from the soldier as each bullet hits. The other player then kills KaiKamakasi and seems completely untouched.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I had this today as well,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o4eams/comment/nj35896/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one comment</u></a> added. “You can even hear it when the bullets hit a body so you know are hitting them. I was playing with a mate and asking him if classes have different armour that I'd never seen because some people just appeared to be bullet sponges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I knew I was clearly hitting them and they just wouldn't go down.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o4vrkl/often_it_feels_like_hit_registration_just_doesnt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>cjoux</u></a> took an even closer look in their own video by counting each bullet for a zoomed-in, slow-motion video of a close-range gunfight. This time, hit markers definitely show hit registration behaving as expected, but despite being trained directly on the target, only some of the nine shots actually land. Other Battlefield 6 players, again, chimed in with their own stories of similar hiccups, and we here at IGN have also experienced phantom bullets that seem to phase right through enemies, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I’m not crazy?” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o4vrkl/comment/nj5xi6x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one reply</u></a> added. “I’ve BEAMED people with a controller. I could literally see that I was on point with my reticle and still lose the engagement somehow. Always one or two bullets just MISS somehow when my gun felt like it shot more than enough to kill someone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s either hit registration or I’m not used to the spread and weapon balance in this game.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, EA is on the case.
