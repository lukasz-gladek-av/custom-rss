            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Magic Puzzle Company is one of my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">favorite jigsaw puzzle brands</a> on the market right now. Each puzzle is made up of 1,000 unique pieces and filled with fun little easter eggs throughout. Best of all, when you finally complete the puzzle you are treated to a secret ending that is different for each one. I personally love these puzzles because every image has some serious 'Where's Waldo' vibes and utilizes different artwork from popular artists I would have otherwise never known about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you aren't already familiar with the earlier <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzles">Magic Puzzle Company Puzzles</a>, I'd recommend checking out Series One to get started. However, if you're a seasoned veteran you'll be happy to know that Amazon has just released two new Series Five puzzles for 2026 and they look quite delightful.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New Series Five Magic Puzzle Company Puzzles</h2><div id="234491"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234491" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Golden Goose</h3></p></div></span></p></div><div id="234492"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234492" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Coveted Comet</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Series Five is the latest series in the Magic Puzzle Company lineup, and these two new puzzles are likely the last entries we'll see until Series Six. Each series has been comprised of three total puzzles, and the first puzzle in this series was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-series-five-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzle-features-art-from-an-adventure-time-designer">actually released back in August 2025</a>. The first option is called The Drippy Trip and features artwork from one of the original Adventure Time artists. I own this puzzle and can confirm that it is an absolute delight to put together—especially as a big Adventure Time fan</p></div><div id="226763"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="226763" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Drippy Trip</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the two new puzzles, the Golden Goose has sort of an early civilization vibe. The artwork is by <a href="https://www.anineillustration.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anine Bösenberg</a>, who cultivates a wonderful illustration style that does a great job of feeling cozy and alive without too much heavy detail. This puzzle is already available on Amazon, but in limited quantities. If stock runs out, however, you can purchase the Series Five bundle to get the full set later in February.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second new puzzle is called The Coveted Comet and looks to feature a colony of aliens inhabiting  some sort of comet or asteroid. The overall design is reminiscent of those cross-section books that show you everything going on within a single building, but with a more organic feel. The artwork comes from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/samuelhayward_art/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samuel Hayward</a>, who appears to have a knack for creating adorable prints. This puzzle isn't available until February 15, but you can currently preorder it on Amazon ahead of its release date.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Magic Puzzle Company Puzzles</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for more puzzles from this brand, you can check out some of the more popular options from previous releases right here:</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 15, 2026 6:49 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/new-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzles-series-five-2026]]></content:encoded>
