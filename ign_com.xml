            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here's what's up and down this week (October 10).</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-where-to-buy-2025">Mega Evolution</a> has kicked off with a bang thanks to its base set releasing in the US recently, and it's single card market is doing some strange things right now. One things for sure, the majority of the top chase cards in this set are getting more affordable by the day. It seems that day one stock is getting better across the board, with The Pokémon Company seemingly printing newer sets into oblivion. The long term effects remain to be seen, but more cards being printed means less damage to your pocket.</p><p id="mega-evolution-crashers-and-climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Evolution Crashers and Climbers">TL:DR; Mega Evolution Crashers and Climbers This Week</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gold Hyper Rare cards are the highest value cards in this set, with Mega Gardevoir ex (187/132) doubling in price compared to market value and Mega Lucario ex (188/132) kicking off high and currently settling at an insane $650 for the time being. There's some supprising Illustration Rare price rises in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-cards-most-expensive-cards">Mega Evolution</a> too, with Helioptile (143/132) rising by 33.6% recently thanks to it's gorgeous artwork. <br>One thing is clear with Mega Evolution, Pokémon trainers and collectors aren't giving in to FOMO. Being able to wait for sealed product and chase cards vs. buying it straight at launch can be a money burner, and it looks like this sentiment is finally sinking in at this point in Pokémania 2025. Let's get into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/feature-image-37-1760099343193.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/ao65eY?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Lucario ex – 188/132</a> is currently going for $650 near mint, which is nearly $70 below it's current market value of $719.37. Whilst it's only a 9.7% drop, it's still a great saving right now and a sign that Gold Hyper Rare cards may settle at or below $600 mark throughout the Mega Evolution era of Pokémon TCG. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Brave is a heaby hitter for 270 damage, but can't be used again next turn, so that's something to pull out when you're backed into a corner or need one more knock out. I'd much rather use Mega Lucario ex for energy recycling and building out the rest of my bench whilst dealing a solid 130 damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aADVd0?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Gardevoir ex – 178/132</a> is currently the highest valued Secret Art Rare at around $313, which is lower than the current market value of $317.08. That might not sound like a big deal, but these small dips can lead to big crashers and could indicate a price correction over the coming weeks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overflowing Wishes is great for getting Psychic energy to your benched Pokémon quickly, and it's artwork is classicly gorgeous. This is 100% a Pokémon card that would look amazing slabbed or in a chase card binder for sure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6DbX2?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Latias ex – 181/132</a> is currently valued at a much more modest $168.05, which is around $11 lower than it's current market value. Again it looks like the fandom are looking towards Gold Hyper Rare cards rather than SIRs in this era, but for me the artwork on this card wins out against the Hyper Rares floating around in this set. Mega Latias' speed and strength is captured perfectly in this artwork. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's Strafe move takes this a step further by causing 40 damage and performing a switch out with a benched Pokémon, perfect for chipping away at opposing Pokémon early game, especially low HP ones. If you follow the switching strategy, Illusory Impulse discards all energy from Mega Latias and deals 300 damage when it counts. Cool or what?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWEd07?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">My boy Mega Venusaur ex (177/132)</a> is giving out crashing energy by dropping around 6.2% to $217.97, but that's still a respectable value for an SIR. However, Mega Venusair is a very playable card, with Solar Transfer allowing trainers to move around grass energy during their turn, which is a fantastic ability and works well with Meganium from the same set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jungle Dump is both a hillarious move name and a cracking move, allowing to deal 240 damage and healing 30 damage from Mega Venusaur ex. That's why I love Venusaur, it's an absolute troll and always has a long game strategy about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QrApdG?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Kangaskhan ex (182/132) SIR</a> is also begginign its decent, running in at $91.48 compared to it's current market value of $94.20. The thing is, Kangaskhan doesn't have a massive following, so naturally it's pricing is going to reflect that. It's not very playable either thanks to trainers relying on coin flips for its main offensive move, however, Run Errand allows trainers to draw two cards per turn which is a bonus.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/feature-image-35-1760099499572.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aeKpB5?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Gardevoir ex – 187/132 Hyper Gold Rare</a> is currently doubling its market value at $600, which is frankly insane. It would however line up up with the other gold hyper rare in the set which is currently going for $650, which makes more sense. It is a ridiculously rare card all things considered, so this level of pricing just weeks after release isn't that much of a suprise. Whilst it's Overflowing Wishes and Mega Symphonia moves are cool, it's value is purely based of the regal presentation and rarity of this Gold Hyper Rare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aXVdDx?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Helioptile – 143/132</a> is moving at a strong pace for an Illustration Rare. It's gorgeous artwork is the main draw here, and it's clearly warrants it's 50.6% climb to $8.90. It's a good idea to snap this one up before it gets higher, it's still a great price for an in-demand Illustration Rare. It's not got the best moved for a basic Pokémon, so this price hike is all about looks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QbMnne?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Lucario ex (179/132) SIR</a> is my top chase card of Mega Evolution just because it features Mega Lucario and Mega Venusaur in battle, two of my favorite Pokémon. It's gone up to $330, which is a rise of 14% from its $289.45 current market value. Something tells me i'm not the only one desperate for this chase card in my collection. Although I can't see anyone using this particular card in a deck, even though Mega Lucario's Mega Brave and Aura Jab moveset is a corker. Once again, this is all about looks, and the artwork here is spot on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z31bbq?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bulbasaur (113/132)</a> comes in it's stunning Illustration Rare format and a <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxx77m?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Evolution promo stamp alternative</a>. The stamped card can be found as a bonus in upgraded booster boxes, and is commanding around $5 more in value right now, which is just a few dollars over it's market value. It's early days for both of these cards, but given Bulbasaurs popularity and the stunning floral and trippy artwork on display here, this is 100% a card to keep an eye on and buy now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

The bad news, the prices might be a little too hot to handle for some. Here's what's available, alongside some handy tips on how to find the restocked items and even just a little less right now.</p><div catalogid="4aaeaa5d-9765-4a22-8fef-b266790ea2f0" id="227468"><div id="227468" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Elite Trainer Box (Mega Gardevoir)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Let's start things off with the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeKpbl?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Evolution Elite Trainer Box (ETB)</a>. You're getting nine Mega Evolution booster packs, one full-art foil promo card featuring Riolu or Alakazam, 65 card sleeves, 40 energy cards, a player’s guide to the Mega Evolution expansion, six damage-counter dice, one competition-legal coin-flip die, and the collector’s box to hold everything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MSRP is $49.99, but these run at a 100% markup right now, and the market price sits around $90-$100 at the time of writing. So, while Amazon does have this in stock, it is also listed at <em>market </em>price ($99.99), not MSRP. It's good for those who have the cash and want an easy and reliable free delivery. You might even have some gift card credit leftover you want to use.</p></div><div catalogid="4aaeaa5d-9765-4a22-8fef-b266790ea2f0" id="227470"><div id="227470" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Booster Bundle (6 Packs)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mega Evolution Booster Bundle is in similar situation, and in stock for <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOgykM?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$59.99 at Amazon</a>. That's around a 100% markup from the MSRP of $29.99. It includes six Mega Evolution boosters, which works out at almost exactly $10 per pack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, if those prices arent what you're looking for, you're next best bet for finding ETBs or Booster Bundles for the new set is via trusted resale sites like <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj7Gpv?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGPlayer</a>. In my opinion its the best place to find sealed booster sets like these, and often enough it's cheaper than paying directly through Amazon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, that's certainly the case, as you can buy the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRDGx?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ETB for around $90-$92</a> including shipping, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z12dY?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Booster Bundle for around $54-$56</a>. It's a small saving compared to Amazon, but still a saving nonetheless.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Mega Evolution Chase Cards</h3><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Upcoming Black Friday Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The closer we get to the November, the more likely you are to see the word "Black Friday" peppered across your every waking moment. Pokémon TCG deals during the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday">Black Friday</a> sales are a complicated beast, as it's unlikely you're going to find much at all that's actually below its original MSRP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for something more immediate, the best advice I can give is to consider <a href="https://zdcs.link/weNPx?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon's Prime Visa Card</a>. If you're a Prime Member already, you'll bag a $150 gift card (that you can immediately use to buy Pokémon cards if you so wish), and up to 7% cashback on purchaes using the card. It's a little niche, but if you don't mind the credit check it's not a bad deal.</p></div><div catalogid="a6b8451e-4fef-449d-8d7e-2f84cb84f315" id="203056"><div id="203056" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Amazon Prime Visa Card</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>7% cashback on Amazon purchases, no annual fee</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not keen, for now you're better off holding out for another Walmart+ drop like the one that went down most recently. In case you missed the news, Walmart was granting early access to rare elusive TCG sets as part of its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-collector-con-sale-includes-rare-magic-the-gathering-commander-decks-boosters-prime-day">Collector Con sale</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-prime-day-elite-trainer-box-discount-walmart-plus-early-access">Prismastic Evolution ETBs for $59.99</a>, a huge discount compared to the $200 minimum you’ll currently find on other marketplaces like <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxLBp?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGPlayer</u></a> for the same set. There was also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-preorder-walmart-plus-early-access-in-stock">Phantasmal Flame preorders</a>, including ETBs for $55, another giant saving considering these go for $150+ resale right now as well. There was a bunch more included as well, such as action figures, Magic: The Gathering sets, and more, but you get the gist.</p></div><div catalogid="33f87b44-ee72-4240-98ad-021acd5d3806" id="192311"><div id="192311" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Walmart+ Membership</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>30-day free trial available. Then it's $12.95/month, or $98/year.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea is that after that early access period, the deals will then be made available to the wider public who don’t have Walmart+. However, given how quickly almost any MSRP-priced stock sells out, most items are typically gone way before general buyers can even get a sniff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't want to miss out on the next one, alongside any of Walmart's upcoming Black Friday deals (which they also put on early access for), I'd suggest picking up a Walmart+ membership when you can. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's $12.95/mo, or $98 annually, and offers a range of benefits beyond early shopping privileges. Members receive free delivery with no order minimum, savings on fuel, access to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/paramount-plus"><u>Paramount+</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/peacock"><u>Peacock</u></a> at no extra cost, and additional perks such as pharmacy delivery and discounts at selected partners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.
