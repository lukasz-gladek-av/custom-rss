            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/virtual-boy-on-switch-2-discovering-nintendos-greatest-failure</link>
            <guid>1424029</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A big sign of emotional maturity is owning up to your most embarrassing failures. For Nintendo, that past mistake is the Virtual Boy, and for the better part of three decades, the company has mostly ignored its most iconic commercial and critical fiasco, likely hoping we’d all just forget they ever released a tabletop headset that was known for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/looking-back-at-the-virtual-boy-nintendos-most-famous-failure">causing splitting headaches and eyestrain with its limited red and black 3D graphics</a>. Nintendo has never rereleased any of the Virtual Boy’s comically small library of just 22 games (several of which were exclusive to Japan), even when they <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/08/13/from-virtual-boy-to-3ds">launched a stereoscopic 3D handheld</a> that would have been the perfect emulator. But 30 years later, Nintendo is finally ready to reminisce and poke some fun at this ridiculous footnote by bringing Virtual Boy to Switch 2 and Switch, complete with a very faithful (and expensive) accessory that recreates the original look and feel. And after playing several games that will be available in the launch lineup on February 17, I’m thrilled to finally be able to discover this lost corner of Nintendo history, even if there aren't very many games to dive into.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though they’re finally bringing some of these lost games back, Nintendo still isn’t making it very easy to access them. Virtual Boy - Nintendo Classics will be available for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers (that’s the more expensive tier that costs $49.99 annually for an individual membership here in the U.S.), and you’ll also need one of two accessories sold through Nintendo’s website to play them. The first choice is the $100 replica of the original hardware, and the second is a $25 cardboard model you hold up to your face like Nintendo’s experimental <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/16/nintendo-labo-vr-kit-review">Labo VR set</a>. You can slide your Switch or Switch 2 into either of these hollow models to supply the screen, and according to the fine print of the latest Virtual Boy trailer, you can only play these games with one of these two accessories – you can’t play them regularly in handheld mode or on your TV. The forgiving view of this decision is that Nintendo aims to preserve the original Virtual Boy experience as closely as possible, while the cynical view is that Nintendo just wants to squeeze more money out of its most hardcore fans for a silly novelty that probably won’t actually provide much playtime. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle of those two extremes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I only saw the cardboard version behind a glass case, but I did get to go hands-on with the replica and instantly fell in love. I pride myself on having played most games from across Nintendo’s entire history, but the Virtual Boy has always been a big red-and-black hole in my library. Secondhand Virtual Boys and game cartridges are simply too expensive, so I’ve never pulled the trigger even if I’ve been tempted several times by various Facebook Marketplace listings, always stopping short when I see the previous owner wrote their name on all their cartridges in permanent marker. So as a hardcore Nintendo enthusiast who enjoys learning about both the good and the bad of their history (and talking about it every week on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL99PCYdTX-vc5oSnnIsUbuSJk6Bli4SpL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Voice Chat, IGN’s all-Nintendo podcast</a>), I’m the exact target audience for this bonkers release.</p><p>The replica unit itself is really high quality.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The unit itself is really high quality. The headset rests on a two-legged stand with a knob you turn to adjust the viewing angle. If you squint or see it from a distance, you’d be forgiven for thinking it was an authentic Virtual Boy. The design is undeniably weird and cool, and I can’t wait to display it in my office. I sat down, looked through the red lenses, and saw the monochrome display staring right back at me. I wear glasses, so often when I try on VR headsets a bit of light bleeds through the sides, but the Virtual Boy’s rubber eye shade was big enough to completely block out 2026 and let me immerse myself entirely in 1996.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Seeing Red</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I first dove into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/virtual-boy-wario-land">Wario Land</a>, one of seven games included in the launch lineup and the game I’ve easily heard the best things about over the years. After just one level, I can see why it has a strong reputation. Apart from the lack of a varied color palette, it looked and played just like the classic Wario Land games, with Wario’s aggressive dash attacks and destructive platforming. This is a sidescroller, but it makes use of the stereoscopic 3D with obstacles like swinging iron balls that move toward and away from you, where the added depth helps you judge their location. Having never played Virtual Boy before, seeing Nintendo games in 3D again made me oddly nostalgic for early 3DS games that made good use of the 3D slider, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/09/super-mario-3d-land-review">Super Mario 3D Land</a>. Wario Land made use of the feature in its platforming, too, with segments that launched Wario into the foreground and background, an idea used a lot in platformers we’d get later like Mutant Mudds, Kirby Triple Deluxe, and Donkey Kong Country Returns. After Wario Land, I hopped around some of the rest of the launch lineup, including Golf and the Punch-Out!!-like Teleroboxer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I only played for about 20 minutes, but I thankfully didn’t get a headache like the original hardware’s reputation would suggest. I’m honestly not sure how long I’ll play in one sitting when my own Virtual Boy preorder shows up in a couple weeks, because even though Wario Land was fun, it’s still kind of a pain to play. The edges of the screen were tough to see when looking in the unit, and it’s not the most comfortable feeling to crane your neck to look inside. At least it’s that authentic neck pain I’ve always wanted, though. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Virtual Boy for Nintendo Switch</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Would I recommend the average Nintendo fan drops $100 or even $25 to play these games? No, probably not. There are only seven of them to play at launch, and they are more enjoyable from a historical perspective than an entertainment one. You could buy seven superior indie games for 100 bucks that come in more than just one color. But if you love exploring wacky bygones from past eras and want a really cool accessory to display in your game room, you’ll probably really like the new Virtual Boy like I did. And there are more games coming after launch, including a previously unreleased F-Zero spinoff called Zero Racers, which is unbelievably exciting as an F-Zero superfan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I walked away not sure which is crazier: the fact that Nintendo made this bizarre piece of hardware 30 years ago, or the fact that they are rereleasing it now. The Virtual Boy sold roughly 750,000 units worldwide, and I’m not sure the market for this retro rerelease is much larger than that. It’s incredibly niche, pretty expensive, and there are only a handful of games worth playing, but they still chose to bring it back. And that’s one reason I love covering Nintendo; they’re the crazy toymaker of the video game industry. Not every swing they take is a smash hit, and I’m so excited to finally learn everything about one of their worst misses.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">The Complete Virtual Boy Game Library</h3><p>Create your own playlist from this listing of every officially released Nintendo Virtual Boy title.

            <guid>1424023</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">There have been many storylines to follow in the Switch 2’s first year, but there’s one specific thread that's bugged me since Nintendo unveiled its plans last April – and it’s only grown more bothersome over the last several months: the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. This series of enhanced Switch 1 ports have been wildly inconsistent across their price points, amount of new content, and quality of enhancements, and I’m frankly tired of Nintendo filling out its release calendar with slightly updated versions of games millions of Switch owners already played several years ago. These feelings were solidified when I attended a preview event to play Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park (yes, that’s the full title, and it’s one of the most hilariously unwieldy names in Nintendo history), which is already the <em>eighth </em>first-party Nintendo Switch 2 Edition since the console launched last June.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say what I played was <em>bad, </em>it just wasn’t particularly inspiring, and complete indifference has been an unfortunate theme across these releases. I sat down with three other journalists to try out a handful of cooperative and competitive minigames found in Bellabel Park, Wonder’s new hub area that contains more than a dozen multiplayer challenges. After selecting our characters from the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition’s slightly expanded roster that now includes Rosalina, we dove into our first co-op level. This one had two of us use the Joy-Con 2’s mouse controls to place platforms for the other two characters to leap across. It felt like something you’d have seen the GamePad used for back in the Wii U era, and it did lead to some clever puzzles for the mouse users where we had to guide a rolling ball along to break a barrier that was blocking the way for our partners. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other co-op mission we tried was essentially hot potato with a Bob-omb, where the four of us had to work our way through a level while also passing an explosive back and forth. A timer would tick down whenever the incorrect player was holding the Bob-omb, leading to a frantic rush to both get to the end as fast as possible while making sure the right person was in control. On the competitive side, one game had us battling to feed our personal baby Yoshi the most fruit, while the other ones we tried were pretty standard races that had us bouncing to the goal or flying on a flower propeller. Before the match begins, each player picks from a small selection of Wonder’s badges to try to get a leg up, which is a smart way to remix the lineup of special abilities that felt somewhat underutilized in the main adventure.</p><p>There's fun to be found, but Mario Wonder's new content is awkwardly straddling the line between 2D Mario and Mario Party.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each game certainly had some fun to offer, but afterwards I couldn’t help but feel like this concept is awkwardly straddling the line: if I wanted multiplayer mayhem with Mario characters, there are so many other, better options like Mario Kart, Party, or 3D World, just to name a few. And, if I wanted 2D Mario, I’d much rather play the traditional <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-review">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> campaign, which I adore. To be completely fair, there is more traditional content on the way in Wonder’s Nintendo Switch 2 Edition in the form of Wonder Effect boss fights against the returning Koopalings and extra challenges that take place in pre-existing levels, but I didn’t get to try any of that at this preview event. Even so, none of this Edition’s additions currently feel as exciting as a couple of extra brand-new worlds likely would have.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Problems with Nintendo Switch 2 Editions</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">And nothing here comes close to justifying the $80 price tag attached to Mario Wonder’s Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. Yes, there’s a $20 upgrade pack for folks who already own Wonder, but for new buyers, a visually upgraded version of a 2023 Switch 1 game with a few new Bellabells and whistles costs more than 2025’s Switch 2-exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which just feels completely out of whack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pricing has been a big problem across the lineup of Nintendo Switch 2 Editions. On paper, I understand the math Nintendo is doing. First-party Switch games notoriously almost never see permanent price drops, so the Nintendo equation is a $60 game plus a $20 content expansion equals an $80 product. But it’s hard not to look at that and just think that it feels kind of greedy. A new generation is the perfect time to discount the prices of your last-gen games, and if Nintendo knocked the Switch 1 version of Wonder down to $40 and priced the Switch 2 version at $60, I don’t think anyone would bat an eye. And Nintendo’s third-party partners aren’t following suit with this steep pricing model: Square Enix recently released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-review-update">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on Switch 2</a> for just $40 – $20 cheaper than it was at launch six years ago, and with all of its DLC and post-launch updates included. That’s a much more enticing offer for prospective buyers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’d be easier to accept the price points if the additional content was reliably great, but that hasn’t been the case. Last July’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a> (another mouthful, and another $80 game/$20 upgrade) launched in what I would consider an unacceptable state for an enhanced rerelease. Firstly, its new content was fairly throwaway, and mostly felt like a way to try and sell the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera accessory for its gimmicky minigames. But the bigger issue is that the enhanced resolution – a huge selling point of these upgrades – only applied to half of the game, while one half was quite literally a drag-and-drop port of the Switch 1 version, 1080p resolution and all. Nintendo eventually released an update that ironed out some of that messy edition’s issues, but it’s still a more misleading, clunkier, and overall worse product than the Switch 1 version that dropped a year earlier for $20 less.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Performance and graphical updates for Switch 1 games on Switch 2 have been a very positive part of this generation so far. Games like Zelda: Link’s Awakening, Echoes of Wisdom, Super Mario Odyssey, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violets-switch-2-upgrade-is-massive-and-it-bodes-well-for-legends-z-a">Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> all look and run way better now on Switch 2, and those patches were released for free! Which is why it’s all the more frustrating when Nintendo paywalls performance patches for the arbitrary games they happen to make more content for. </p><p>It's frustrating when Nintendo paywalls performance patches for the arbitrary games they happen to make more content for. <span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby and the Forgotten Land had some noticeable framerate issues on Switch 1, and on Switch 2 it now runs at a flawless 60 fps… but only if you buy the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-review">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a> game ($80) or upgrade pack ($20). Sorry, Kirby fans, Forgotten Land was chosen to get a batch of new levels, which means you have to pay 20 bucks to get the improved performance that’s free across most of Nintendo’s other releases. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition-review-update">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition-review-update">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> didn’t get any new content outside of extra lore and quality of life updates only accessible through a Nintendo smartphone app, but those cost $10 more rather than being free upgrades. Those two are also included as part of your Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, but none of the others are. Oh, and Breath of the Wild’s Nintendo Switch 2 Edition doesn’t come with its DLC, that’s still another $20 on its own. There's a lot to follow!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I may not be a game developer, but apart from things like mouse, microphone, or camera controls, there’s not much actual <em>content</em> in any of these expansions that appear to warrant being next-gen only. I’m sure most of these multiplayer minigames in Mario Wonder would work just fine on Switch 1, but for seemingly no reason other than to push people toward Nintendo’s next-gen console, they’re locked behind the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is actually the exception that handled this correctly, adding its new items and features in a free update for both Switch 1 and 2 players to enjoy, while keeping the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrades limited to higher resolution, mouse controls, and other niceties that actually don’t work on Switch 1. That Nintendo Switch 2 Edition costs $65 standalone or $5 for the upgrade pack, if you’re keeping score at home.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan Ranks Every First-Party Switch 2 Game</h3><p>Follow this list for my ranking of every Nintendo-published Switch 2 game from the very start of the generation.

These two launched alongside their Switch 1 counterparts on the same day as cross-gen releases. They cost $10 more than the Switch 1 versions, and deliver higher resolution and framerates, but don’t feature any Switch 2-exclusive content. It’s still technically a paywalled performance update, but it feels slightly more acceptable when it’s a brand-new game rather than dusting off an old one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the grand scheme of things, this obviously isn’t the biggest deal in the world, and Nintendo has still put out plenty of <em>actual </em>Switch 2 games like Bananza, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-review">Kirby Air Riders</a>, and more. But in an era where being a Nintendo fan is the most expensive it’s been since the cartridge days of the Nintendo 64, the Nintendo Switch 2 Editions feel like the most egregious example of Nintendo squeezing its most dedicated fans for a few extra dollars. It seems Nintendo wanted to repeat its strategy from the last console generation of porting as many Wii U games as possible to Nintendo Switch to make some more money and make the wait for the next truly <em>new </em>thing feel shorter, but it just isn’t coming across the same way this time. There were barely any Wii U owners – as of this morning, Switch 2 has already passed Wii U's lifetime sales in just seven months – so enhanced ports like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury</a> were basically new games to most of the audience. And even though it was unfortunate that people who already owned these games on Wii U had to pay full price again to get them on Switch because of the shift from discs back to cartridges, they didn’t cost $5, $10, or even $20 more than they did originally for people jumping in for the first time. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Surely we’re still in the first wave of Nintendo Switch 2 Editions that were planned before the Switch 2 launched, so it’ll be interesting to see if Nintendo continues pumping them out based on how the marketplace responds. It’s tough to get a comprehensive grasp of their success because of how Nintendo reports its sales data across upgrade packs and the two platforms, but it’s worth noting they've failed to provide updated numbers for Kirby at all in the last two quarterly financial reports, suggesting its totals were likely soft. It’s entirely possible one reason these Editions exist to train studios on how to develop for more powerful hardware on projects with a short turnaround time, and now those teams are onto the next <em>new</em> 2D Mario, Animal Crossing, Kirby, and Mario Party with a bit more knowledge. I hope all of Nintendo’s teams swiftly move on, because this is a pattern I don’t really want to continue for the rest of the generation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also went hands-on with plenty of Switch 2 games that don’t have ridiculously wordy titles (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-a-first-look-at-the-nintendo-switch-2-game-boxes">and box art</a>, for that matter), so you should check out my impressions of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-leans-way-harder-on-the-mario-than-the-tennis">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-on-switch-2-is-horrifyingly-great">Resident Evil Requiem and Pragmata on Switch 2</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/virtual-boy-on-switch-2-discovering-nintendos-greatest-failure">my lovely time discovering Nintendo’s greatest failure: the Virtual Boy</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Logan Plant is the host of Nintendo Voice Chat and IGN's Database Manager &amp; Playlist Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom is one of the strongest third-party publishers on Switch 2 so far. It released an excellent port of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/street-fighter-6-nintendo-switch-2-edition-gameplay-treehouse-live">Street Fighter 6</a> on the console’s launch day, and it’s keeping the momentum going in 2026 by bringing most of its big games to the platform, including Resident Evil Requiem, Pragmata, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-is-flying-toward-nintendo-switch-2-next-year">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> (with dedicated amiibo figures for all three games!). I went hands-on with Resident Evil and Pragmata on Switch 2 in both handheld and docked mode, and was extremely impressed with how these two slightly scaled down experiences are shaping up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d reasonably expect, the Switch 2 versions clearly don’t have the same fidelity as their counterparts on PC or the other consoles, but if you only have a Switch 2 or really value bringing your games on the go, the versions I saw were perfectly viable and didn’t make me wish I was playing on one of my beefier machines at home. Plus, I really enjoyed both games separate from my evaluation of their performance, and think they will each make excellent additions to Switch 2’s growing third-party lineup.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Resident Evil Requiem: Switch 2 Impressions</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with Resident Evil. The demo I tried on Switch 2 was nothing new if you’ve been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview"><u>following the lead-up to Requiem</u></a>. I controlled newcomer Grace Ashcroft as she woke up on an examination table in a medical bay. This section sees Grace tiptoeing around dark hallways that are occasionally illuminated by flickering lights or blinking red alarms. It builds a lot of tension in these opening moments, like when I turned a corner to see an unidentifiable mass in the distance, only to cautiously approach it and see it’s just a horse statue staring back at me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was immediately impressed by Grace’s character model and animations in the demo’s introductory cutscene. It opens with a closeup shot of her eye, and it looked very detailed and pulled me into the world right away. That strong first impression carried through the rest of the demo. Requiem appears to shoot for 60 fps on Switch 2, and I didn’t notice any drops throughout my session. Granted, this is not a very action-heavy portion of the game – Grace is completely unarmed for the entirety of this segment besides glass bottles she can throw as distractions – but it was still great to see the Switch 2 keeping up with Requiem so far. </p><p>Requiem shoots for a smooth 60 fps on Switch 2, and I didn’t notice any major drops.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, I found a lighter that let me explore a previously pitch black hallway I’d skipped earlier. The lighting effects that the lighter projected onto the wall may not have been as complex as on the other platforms, but it’s certainly not bad, and if I weren’t looking at it with a very critical eye, I probably wouldn’t have noticed. This dark hallway led to the main confrontation of the demo: a game of cat and mouse against a towering, terrifying monster with long, disgusting fingers that chased after Grace for the remainder of my playtime. It was very intense, and the biggest compliment I can give Resident Evil Requiem on Switch 2 is that I was so terrified by being relentlessly stalked by this monster that any concerns I had about the version I was playing instantly melted away. All I could focus on was Grace’s survival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After wrapping up the demo on the television from Grace’s first-person perspective, I swapped to the slightly less stressful third-person perspective in handheld mode and was similarly enthused with what I saw. Honestly, I think Resident Evil is far more fitting as a big screen experience with the lights turned off, but if you want to play it in handheld, the Switch 2 delivered a solid experience in this demo. There’s a noticeable resolution difference switching from the 4K television to the 1080p Switch 2 screen, but it still looked great and maintained solid performance, too. In third-person, I really like how Grace stumbled and tripped over herself while initially running away from the monster. She’s clearly as terrified and stressed as we are, and that small detail really sold it. I didn’t get to play as Leon Kennedy, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-the-final-preview"><u>but based on Dale Driver’s recent preview</u></a>, I’m excited to try the more action-heavy portions that will balance out the terror I felt after completing Grace’s demo. Resident Evil Requiem is coming to Switch 2 (and other platforms) on February 27, and on the same day, Capcom is releasing Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil Village on Switch 2 as well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Pragmata: Switch 2 Impressions</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Requiem is bringing the newest entry in one of Capcom’s most historic franchises to Nintendo players. On the other side of the coin, Pragmata is Capcom’s newest IP that’s also debuting on Switch 2. This sci-fi third-person shooter stars a soldier named Hugh and an android he names Diana as they explore a lunar research facility filled with hostile robots. I played the Sketchbook demo, which is the same slice of the game currently available to try on PC and coming to consoles at a later date. It covers Hugh and Diane’s introduction all the way through the first boss encounter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pragmata on Switch 2 was similarly impressive, but I did notice a few more rough edges and fuzzier details compared to Requiem. My theory is that’s because Pragmata takes place in far brighter, bigger areas than Resident Evil’s claustrophobic hallways, exposing some more of its shortcomings. But with that said, it still ran very well and felt great to play, even in its more action-focused combat scenarios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I really like the spin Pragmata puts on third-person shooting. Hugh and Diana have to work together to take down enemies, as Diana hacks into the androids to deal damage, slow them down, and expose weak points. Hacking is represented by a grid minigame that appears when you target an enemy, where you press the face buttons to navigate a cursor to the goal as quickly as you can, passing through damage multipliers on your way. It’s snappy and satisfying to pull off, made better by the fact that the action doesn’t stop when you’re hacking as Diana, meaning you still have to aim, shoot, and dodge as Hugh at the same time. It’s immediately fun to split your attention between the two objectives, and I’m excited to see how Pragmata builds upon its unique foundation deeper in the campaign.</p><p>It’s immediately fun to split your attention between Pragmata's hacking and shooting.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Running around the space station and solving light hacking puzzles was fun, too, and the heft of Hugh’s armor was sold by Switch 2’s HD rumble, as I could feel each footstep on the proper side of the controller. Just like Requiem, Pragmata was downgraded in handheld mode but still totally playable. Responsiveness is very important in Pragmata because of all its quick-time events, and the Switch 2 didn’t miss a beat in this demo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom was the only third-party presence at the Nintendo Switch 2 preview showcase I attended last week, but I also got to go hands-on with a lot of Nintendo’s upcoming first-party releases.
