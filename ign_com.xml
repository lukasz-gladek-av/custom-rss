            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Get Total War: Warhammer 3, Etrian Odyssey HD, and more.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new Humble Choice lineup becomes available on the first Tuesday of each month. That means <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGrB1B?object_uuid=a0ba2658-82f0-4bda-819c-ce4ad4c8cb9d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">November’s Humble Choice</a> is now available for $14.99. This month, members get eight PC games with a total MSRP of $254, including Total War: Warhammer 3, Etrian Odyssey HD, and more. Read on for the full list and all the details.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Humble Choice November 2025 Game Lineup</h2><div catalogid="9793c6e9-126c-41a5-a073-5b90c5dd9727" id="230111"><div id="230111" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Humble Choice - November 2025</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All eight PC games are delivered in the form of Steam codes. It’s a solid lineup of titles, representing a wide variety of genres. That means there’s something for everyone, and some off-the-beaten-path games you might not normally buy, but now you get them without having to pay anywhere near full price. Here’s the full list of games included in the November 2025 Humble Choice, with blurbs from the press release.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Total War Warhammer III</strong>: A grand-scale strategy game where fantasy armies battle daemonic forces in the Realm of Chaos.</li><li><strong>Another Crab's Treasure</strong>: A Soulslike adventure where a hermit crab fights enemies using trash as makeshift shells.</li><li><strong>Pharaoh: A New Era</strong>: A 4K remake of the classic city-builder where you manage resources, appease gods, and build magnificent monuments in Ancient Egypt.</li><li><strong>Etrian Odyssey HD</strong>: A first-person dungeon crawler focused on creating a party and mapping a dangerous labyrinth.</li><li><strong>No More Heroes 3</strong>: A stylish hack-and-slash game where an assassin fights alien superheroes in over-the-top battles.</li><li><strong>Synergy</strong>: A sci-fi city-builder about building a sustainable human settlement on a harsh alien planet.</li><li><strong>Spin Hero</strong>: A roguelike RPG where combat and progression are determined by spinning a slot machine.</li><li><strong>Paleo Pines</strong>: A cozy farming sim where you run a ranch, explore an island, and befriend dinosaurs.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest game in here is probably the strategy game Total War: Warhammer III, which we gave a 9/10 in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/total-war-warhammer-3-review">review</a>. It’s a huge blockbuster PC game with many dozens of potential hours of play time. Another Crab’s Treasure is a surprisingly accessible Soulslike game that got an 8/10 in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/another-crabs-treasure-review">review</a>. And Etrian Odyssey HD is a personal favorite, a remaster of a Nintendo DS dungeon crawler that has you draw the map as you explore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyone interested in relaxing farm sims can try out Paleo Pines, while No More Heroes 3 offers fast-paced action. There’s plenty here to try, and any one of these games is worth the $14.99 asking price all on its own. Getting the whole bundle for that price is a killer deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As always with Humble Choice, a membership gets you a month of IGN Plus as an added bonus, as well as access to more than 50 DRM-free games in the Humble Vault. You also get a discount on Humble Store purchases, with bigger discounts the longer you keep your membership active.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, 5% of each Humble Choice membership goes to charity. This month’s charity is <a href="https://www.nokidhungry.org/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No Kid Hungry</a>, which seems like a particularly timely choice. It works to make sure kids across the country have reliable access to healthy meals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

Like how this year's Fantastic Four movie was a '50's version of the future? Enter ROUTINE, an upcoming first-person sci-fi horror game set on a lunar base. Like all good horror games, silence and loneliness are your worst enemies, and that's true in ROUTINE – except for the part where you discover a foe who thinks the primary threat is, in fact, you. Piece together the events that took place prior to your arrival, and try to survive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ROUTINE is our IGN First "cover story" game for November, ahead of its December 4 release for PC (Steam and Xbox on PC) and Xbox (Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Xbox Cloud) – including Xbox Game Pass on day one. This first exclusive video (watch it above) introduces you to the C.A.T. Ultraview Module, a tool you'll need to make frequent use of as you explore the lunar base. It looks like a camcorder and a radar gun had a baby, and...you'll have to check out the video to see what it does.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Routine - 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">ROUTINE has quite the development story, having originally been announced over a decade ago.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Eight years on from its initial announcement, the long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is now just a month from launch — and today, fans can watch a fresh trailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Due to launch on December 4, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond remains mysterious, with Nintendo keeping details of its much-delayed first-person shooter largely under wraps. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly how it picks up the story of the Metroid Prime trilogy, 18 years later, we have no idea. All the areas Samus will visit? Not a clue. Chozo lore? Dark Samus? Phazon? Other bounty hunters? Time will tell. (Though, as of September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-has-a-release-date-while-samus-has-a-motorbike">we know Samus somehow has a motorbike</a>.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This year, in particular, has seen Nintendo fans fret over the continued wait for more information, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-metroid-prime-4-beyond-delay-rumors-nintendo-recommits-to-2025-launch">rumors of a delay spread</a> as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-reportedly-set-for-september-as-metroid-prime-4-release-date-and-mario-40th-anniversary-speculation-mounts">the wait for a release date dragged on</a>. Glimpses of the game to date have not prompted an outpouring of excitement, either, with a fairly mixed response to the Switch 2 event demo (to be fair, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-played-metroid-prime-4-beyond-first-hands-on-preview">linear and not overly exciting section from the game's opening</a>) and brief showing in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-september-2025-live-updates-everything-announced">September's general Nintendo Direct</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fan eyebrows have been raised, too, by the apparent lack of marketing dedicated to the game. Where Kirby Air Riders has been featured in two lengthy dedicated Nintendo Directs, Metroid Prime 4 has had none.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there is still time for the Metroid Prime 4 hype machine to kick into gear. And now, 30 days from launch, fans are celebrating today's new trailer doing just that. While there are no standout reveals in the video, it does an entertaining job of showing Samus in action, highlighting baddie Sylux, and revisiting more of the game's setting: the planet Viewros.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Metroidvania Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Trailer felt like, 'Yes, we've heard you all about the marketing. Please have this,'" wrote Metroid fan Jawmuncher on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/metroid-prime-4-beyond-survive-trailer.1343221/page-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>. "I approve. This is a trailer I could use to sell someone on the game. The last trailer I could not unless they REALLY like motorcycles."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Finally a good trailer," agreed AppleKid. "Still want to know more but this trailer at least isn't hype deflating like the last 2. Game looks great!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But still, there are calls for a dedicated Metroid Prime 4 deep dive, via a dedicated Nintendo Direct. "Kirby Air Riders got two," noted Khanimus. "The game people have been actively anticipating since it was announced 8 years ago probably should get one."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
