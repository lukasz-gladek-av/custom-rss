            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">While Ubisoft keeps quiet about a potential <a href="https://in.ign.com/assassins-creed-black-flag" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> remake, the actor behind the game's hero Edward Kenway has offered up some teasing words to fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A souped-up version of Ubisoft's piratical Assassin's Creed entry has been the subject of numerous leaks over the past few years, and is now widely expected among fans. But Ubisoft itself has never confirmed the project ‚Äî and declined to comment on the matter when contacted by IGN last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-swirl-as-collectible-maker-admits-there-is-something-going-on">when an Assassin's Creed merchandise maker also dropped an obvious Black Flag remake hint</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, at a fan convention, Edward Kenway voice actor Matt Ryan has given perhaps the most obvious tease so far that something is on the horizon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Have you beaten the game?" Ryan asks a fan, as captured on video by TikTok user therebelarchive. "Well, you might have to beat it again..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the fan replies "Is this true? I have to run through all of them again," Ryan responds with a knowing wink, and then says: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Well, especially this one. There's a reason I say that, but I can't say anything."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Matt Ryan (Voice of Edward Kenway) Teases Black Flag Remaster via a fan interaction at a convention! </p><p>Quote <br>‚ÄúHave you beat the game?‚Ä¶ well you may have to beat it again üòâ‚Äù<br>And <br>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason I say that but I can‚Äôt say anything‚Ä¶‚Äù<a href="https://twitter.com/TheHiddenOneAC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@TheHiddenOneAC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealZephryss?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@TheRealZephryss</a> <a href="https://t.co/vg6RghgcE7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/vg6RghgcE7</a></p></div>‚Äî YT.com/Super DropKick (@SuperDropKick17) <a href="https://twitter.com/SuperDropKick17/status/1939385926305849352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">While Ryan is likely aware of the ongoing speculation around a Black Flag remaster, could his involvement in it extend beyond seeing his prior work re-released? Reports have suggested Ubisoft is working on a substantial re-working of Black Flag ‚Äî does that mean Ryan himself is involved, re-recordling dialogue, or contributing to new story elements?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Multiple reports charting the game's development have surfaced over the past couple of years, with the  <a href="https://in.ign.com/assassins-creed-black-flag/188218/news/ubisoft-is-reportedly-working-on-an-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Flag remake allegedly being worked on by Skull and Bones studio Ubisoft Singapore</a> (remember that Skull and Bones itself started life as a Black Flag spin-off), with work underway to offer something <a href="https://in.ign.com/assassins-creed-black-flag/222720/news/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-rumors-hint-at-new-in-game-systems-engine-it-will-be-built-on-an" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ultimately more substantial </a><a href="https://in.ign.com/assassins-creed-black-flag/222720/news/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-rumors-hint-at-new-in-game-systems-engine-it-will-be-built-on-an" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">than just a simple remaster</a>. Reports have suggested that this new version of Black Flag will boast all of the visual fidelity found in the recent Assassin's Creed Shadows, as well as expanded wildlife and combat systems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With no all-new Assassin's Creed game set for the end of this year, fans believe the Black Flag remake would be well positioned to arrive in time for the holidays. Here's hoping Ryan isn't made to walk the plank for dropping this latest hint, and it's not too long before Ubisoft makes the remake official.
