However, the presentation ended with one big tease that’s farther out – a major feature coming to World of Warcraft’s next expansion that players have been asking about for years: player housing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The presentation didn’t offer any real details about exactly how player housing would work or what it would entail. All we learned is that the feature is in the works, and that we’ll finally see it in World of Warcraft: Midnight, the game’s next expansion planned for a full reveal in late summer of 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea of player housing has been toyed around with in expansions going as far back as the Warlords of Draenor. At the time, the “Garrison” feature was floated as WoW’s answer to player housing, but ultimately fell short of the customizability and more permanent nature of player housing in other MMORPGs, such as Final Fantasy 14.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Garrisons were ultimately abandoned at the end of Warlords of Draenor, serving no real lasting purpose for most players, and Blizzard hasn’t revisited the idea of player housing since. Notably, Guild Wars 2 just implemented player housing earlier this year as well, suggesting the feature is a popular one for MMO players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, we don’t know much else about what World of Warcraft’s next expansion, Midnight, will entail. We did see a content roadmap during the presentation that suggests the expansion will be officially unveiled in late summer of 2025. Midnight will be the second part of what Blizzard is calling “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-announces-next-three-expansions-in-world-of-warcraft-the-worldsoul-saga-blizzcon-2023">The Worldsoul Saga</a>”, which also encompasses The War Within and the expansion following Midnight, entitled The Last Titan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-everything-announced">everything announced from today’s Warcraft Direct right here</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcraft-1-and-2-remasters-shadow-dropped-with-improved-graphics-quality-of-life-improvements-and-other-new-features">remasters of Warcraft I and II</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-next-major-patch-will-finally-visit-the-legendary-goblin-capital-undermine">next patch for The War Within</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-classic-heads-to-mists-of-pandaria-next-year">next update for World of Warcraft: Classic</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

They’ll receive a new customizable ground mount specifically built for use in Undermine (it’s a fancy car) that goes really, <em>really </em>fast.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As usual for a new major patch, Undermine(d) will bring with it numerous new activities. There’s a new arena map, and a new dungeon, Operation Floodgate, which will join the remaining four The War Within launch dungeons in the Mythic pool. There will also be two new delves, some new variations on existing delves, and new story and updates for delve companion Brann Bronzebeard. Finally, there’s a new eight-boss raid, The Liberation of Undermine, which will take teams through the city itself and into the decadent heart of the goblin empire, where players will finally fight goblin faction leader Gallywix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Undermine is a significant location in the Warcraft universe, though this is the first time players will visit it. In Warcraft’s history, Undermine was the underground site beneath the isle of Kezan that goblins claimed for their capital after rebelling against the Zandalari trolls. However, during the Cataclysm, the volcano the city was situated beneath erupted. The goblins evacuated the surface of Kezan, and Undermine was thought to have been destroyed. However, there have been hints ever since then that Undermine is still operational, and the new patch will allow us to see the city for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft patch 11.1 “Undermine(d)” is planned for release early next year, with a patch 11.2 coming in the summer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-classic-heads-to-mists-of-pandaria-next-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today’s Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct, Blizzard announced its next big plans for World of Warcraft: Classic. Shocking no one, it’s planning to move onto the next expansion in 2025: Mists of Pandaria.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with other Classic expansions, Mists of Pandaria will launch with “some changes” to its original form, but will largely retain the same  content and features from when it first released in 2012. Among other new features, Mists of Pandaria introduced the continent of Pandaria, the playable Pandaran race that could join either the Alliance or the Horde, the Monk class, pet battles, Scenarios, and flexible raiding.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, though, this will be a different experience than the one offered during the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-is-revisiting-mists-of-pandaria-in-world-of-warcraft-remix">recent Mists of Pandaria: Remix event</a>, which allowed players to speed level through Pandaria with new spells and abilities, new items, and other twists on its original gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The addition of Mists of Pandaria furthers World of Warcraft: Classic’s steady march to catch up with existing World of Warcraft content. However, recently some Classic players have begun to criticize the direction of the game and lament how far away it’s gotten from the original Classic feel as expansions have been added. While Blizzard has done some things to address this, such as add new Classic modes like Hardcore and Season of Discovery, players are increasingly asking for more opportunities to replay the oldest content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those players, Blizzard announced that it will be adding new “vanilla” Classic realms on November 21. This will include new PvP, PvE, and new “hardcore mode” realms, which will go through the same steady cadence of patch updates as past Classic realms, with the Molten Core raid launching a few weeks after launch. These new realms (minus the Hardcore realms) will eventually progress to The Burning Crusade Classic, giving players the opportunity to start all over once more and progress through early WoW content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft: Classic’s Mists of Pandaria update will launch sometime in 2025.

Today, Blizzard announced it’s releasing remasters of both the original Warcraft and Warcraft 2, and they’re both out today.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During today’s Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct stream, Blizzard unveiled both remasters, which will include fully updated graphics as well as an option to revert back to original visuals, a number of quality of life features, and improved UI and UX features. Warcraft II will also include multiplayer, with all legacy custom maps being compatible and playable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Critically, these are both being billed as remasters rather than full-blown “reimaginings” like Warcraft III: Reforged. Fans of the original game widely panned Warcraft III: Reforged due to the many changes made from the original, technical issues, and features that were missing or degraded from the original. Our own reviewer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcraft-3-reforged-review">gave it a 7/10</a>, but described it as "uninspired." Upon its release, many fans expressed frustration that Blizzard had not simply remastered the original Warcraft III, which may be why Blizzard opted for a lighter touch with Warcraft I and II.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, Warcraft III: Reforged is also receiving an update today that will include a graphics overhaul and various other quality of life changes that may improve the experience. These include the ability to toggle between the game’s new graphics, old graphics, and a new remastered look that’s reminiscent of the classic look but has a higher resolution. Reforged players will also get the ability to mix and match certain UI elements in all three graphic options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warcraft III: Reforged will join the remasters of Warcraft 1 and 2 in a revamped “Battle Chest” hearkening back to the classic, popular bundle. The bundle’s pricing will adjust based on what games players already own, meaning if you already own Reforged, you can add the two remasters at a discount.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warcraft I and II Remastered, Warcraft III: Reforged 2.0, and the new Battle Chest are out today. You can catch up with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-everything-announced">everything announced from today’s Warcraft Direct right here</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-next-major-patch-will-finally-visit-the-legendary-goblin-capital-undermine">upcoming updates to World of Warcraft</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-classic-heads-to-mists-of-pandaria-next-year">World of Warcraft: Classic</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-next-expansion-finally-adding-player-housing-after-years-of-requests-by-fans">teases of the next retail expansion, Midnight</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
