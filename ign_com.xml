            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/more-of-thps-3-4-remastereds-soundtrack-revealed-song-list-so-far<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Remember when, remember when...remember when music so beautiful?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest reasons for why we remember the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games so fondly is because of the licensed soundtrack. From punk rock to hip-hop, and a new wave of hardcore with the remasters, the series forged our music tastes, and it will continue to do so with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remaster-revealed-everything-you-need-to-know">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remastered coming July 11</a> this year. In the lead up to its release, Activision is putting together <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWU4xkATYcbh7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official THPS 3 + 4 playlist on Spotify</a> and continually updating it as it reveals more and more of the song list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first wave of tracks have just been revealed, and here are the songs we currently know of for the THPS 3 + 4 Remastered soundtrack:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>"Ace of Spades" by Motörhead</li><li>"Them Bones" by Alice in Chains</li><li>"Ultimate" by Denzel Curry</li><li>"Gang of Four" by Damaged Goods</li><li>"96 Quite Bitter Beings" by CKY</li><li>"Yankee and the Brave (Ep. 4)" by Run the Jewels</li><li>"King of the Beach" by Wavves</li><li>"Real Thing" by Turnstile</li><li>"Not the Same" by Bodyjar</li><li>"New Wage Salary" by End It</li><li>"Head" by Jeff Rosenstock</li><li>"Collard Greens" by Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar</li><li>"Outta Here" by KRS-One</li><li>"Result" by TCMF</li><li>"Dog Years" by Urethane</li><li>"Charlotte" by Kittie</li><li>"Mass Appeal" by Gang Starr</li><li>"Faster than the World" by H20</li><li>"Roadkill" by Starcrawler</li><li>"Amoeba" by Adolescents</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, those who get the deluxe edition of the game, or access it through Xbox Game Pass, will also get a full band version of the Doom E1M1 theme song as a playable track (along with the Doom Slayer and Revenant skater skins).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, I'd love to hear Guttermouth's "I'm Destroying the World" and AFI's "The Boy Who Destroyed the World" from THPS 3 make comebacks, as well as Bad Religion's "Big Bang" and Flogging Molly's "Drunken Lullabies" from THPS 4. That's mostly because I'm a washed up old punk kid. However, it's an opportunity to discover new music and celebrate the scene as it is today, bridging the gap between the new and old <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-remake-review">as was the case with THPS 1 + 2 Remastered</a> from 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">preorder THPS 3 + 4 Remastered's deluxe or collector's edition</a> can access the playable demo right now which includes two parks, two skaters, and a limited soundtrack. An exclusive physical Birdhouse skate deck also comes with the collector's edition. You'll also be able to access the full game early on July 8, three days ahead of its official release date.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

One player set out to show just that, with a long journey from a starting zone to the peaks of its later areas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ja5g5x/did_you_know_theres_only_1_loading_screen_between/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monster Hunter subreddit</a>, user -BrotherPig- posted a video, below, chronicling their journey across the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Monster_Hunter_Wilds_Locations">zones of Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. They start out in the Windward Plains, running across the sand and dunes, all the way to the later game zones and, eventually, some of the last game areas and locales. Spoilers await, if you haven't rolled credits on the campaign just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an impressively long trip, and emphasizes just how linked all the zones are. There's only one loading screen that happens, around halfway into the trip, as the traveler heads from the Oilwell Basin into the Iceshard Cliffs. Otherwise, it's one big run for this presumably exhausted Seikret.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds isn't entirely without loading screens, of course. Aside from the one we see in the trip above, there's also the loading screen to enter the training grounds, and those you would get from fast traveling or departing for a friend's quest. But the connectivity is certainly fascinating to see in action, and gave me a new appreciation for all the little corridors and passages that connect the Forbidden Lands.</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-popularity-is-thanks-to-story-emphasis-immersion-and-cross-play-series-producer-says">secret sauce for Monster Hunter Wilds</a> though, according to a series producer, is apparently in its story, immersion, and cross-play.

It’s due out late 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> does exactly what it says on the tin: players clean grubby environments with a powerwash. It’s a smash hit, with over 17 million players enjoying the satisfying ping whenever a dirty section of the environment is cleared of dirt. PowerWash Simulator did so well that it ended up attracting big-time licensed DLC, including Warhammer 40,000, Shrek, and SpongeBob SquarePants.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the commercial success of PowerWash Simulator that put FuturLab in a position to self-publish the sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“PowerWash Simulator 2 feels like a natural evolution from its predecessor,” said Dan Chequer, Design Director at FuturLab.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The original game’s design was all about eliminating anything that detracted from the pure satisfaction of taking something dirty and making it clean. PowerWash Simulator 2 is all about adding in even more avenues for players to achieve that same sense of satisfaction, with new tools, features and quality of life improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We're really excited to see players dust off their power washers and get stuck into this brand-new campaign, that brings you even more to clean, and even more ways to release the pressure.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">PowerWash Simulator 2 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">PowerWash Simulator 2 includes a new campaign uncovering more of Muckingham’s mysteries and brand-new grime-coated locations like Sponge Valley, Power Falls, and Lubri City. You even have a home base this time around, where you can “put down your roots and make the place yours by collecting furniture and trinkets to spruce it up along the way, then invite your power wash pals over to check out your pad.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also new is split-screen and the ability to share campaign progression online together for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now here’s something interesting: FuturLab said it’s “excited” to share more information in April.
