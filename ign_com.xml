While he only mentioned Dark Souls, this theoretically opens the door for other FromSoftware games such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/demons-souls-review-2">Demon's Souls</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/21/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>, and, dare we say it, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review">Bloodborne</a> to cameo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign drops up to three players into a condensed version of Limgrave from the main Elden Ring and tasks them with surviving. Enemies and structures are procedurally generated to allow for a varied experience, with players encouraged to battle to grow stronger and survive the night, when a boss appears.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Surviving three days and nights spawns a major boss for players to take down, and the game has eight in total for players to conquer. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-we-played-it">IGN has already played the game and you can read our impressions here</a>.
