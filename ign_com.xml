Nintendo's legendary action-adventure franchise has seen over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-legend-of-zelda-games">25 mainline games</a> and a handful of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review">great spinoffs</a>, and if you own a Nintendo Switch and subscribe to their online service, you have access to just about every single Zelda title to date. But the green-clad Hero of Time transcends just video games, so we've put together a gift guide for that special Zelda fan in your life. From the video games and controllers, books to apparel, and even an amazing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-great-deku-tree">LEGO Deku Tree set</a>, there's quite literally something for both new and old Legend of Zelda fans alike. </p><p id="video-games"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Video Games">Legend of Zelda Video Games</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Nintendo Switch 2 just around the corner and both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom receiving performance upgrades, you can still pick up two of the best games the system still has to offer. And if you're waiting a bit to pick up the Switch 2, there are still plenty of other Legend of Zelda games to keep you occupied. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-review">Skyward Sword HD</a> and the<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/19/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review"> Link's Awakening</a> remake are the best ways to revisit these older titles, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review">Echoes of Wisdom</a> finally allows players to take control of Zelda. The first two Hyrule Warriors titles are incredibly fun action games, so be sure to check them out before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> releases on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p id="themed-accessories"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Themed Accessories">Legend of Zelda Controllers and Accessories</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now what if you already have all these Legend of Zelda games, what are you supposed to play them with to show your support of the franchise? Luckily there are tons of great Zelda-themed controllers and accessories to deck your system out with. From official Zelda Joy-Con (I have Skyward Sword HD set, they look incredible!) and pro controllers to third-party Nintendo Switch dock covers, you'll be sprucing up your game room setup in no time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more things like this without the Zelda theme, you can check out our guide to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-accessories">best Switch accessories</a>.</p><p id="coffee-table-books"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Coffee Table Books">Legend of Zelda Encyclopedias</h2></p><p id="manga"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Manga">Legend of Zelda Manga</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are an impressive amount of Legend of Zelda manga and encyclopedias that look great a shelf or coffee table.

The encyclopedias are great collectibles for any Zelda fan, as they offer closer looks at the lore and history of Hyrule, complete with old concept art and sketches. </p><p id="tabletop-games"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tabletop Games">Legend of Zelda Puzzles, Cards, and Board Games</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are tons of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzles-for-adults">great jigsaw puzzles for adults</a>, and the Legend of Zelda-themed puzzles are among our favorite. The 1.000-piece Hyrule map puzzle would look right at home framed over a fireplace once complete. You can also find a handful of classic board games with a Legend of Zelda skin, such as the Monopoly Legend of Zelda Collector's Edition or Legend of Zelda Uno. Also, be sure to have a look at the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-can-get-a-pack-of-official-legend-of-zelda-playing-cards-for-just-10">official Zelda playing cards</a> (these are Japanese imports only!). </p><p id="lego-sets"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="LEGO Sets">LEGO Great Deku Tree Set</h2></p><div catalogid="a354f9e4-c347-41a8-9501-e2ef3cec9a91" id="201337"><div id="201337" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Great Deku Tree Set</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Set #77092, includes 2,500 pieces.
