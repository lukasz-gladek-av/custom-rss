Like many fresh ideas, the concept of a deck-building game is startling in its simplicity. Card games where you build a custom deck before you play have been around a while. In a deck-building game, though, you build the deck <em>while </em>you play. Starting with a hand of currency cards, you cash them in for other, more interesting cards, and make a deck on-the-fly you think is good enough to win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn't just gamers who got bowled over by the brilliance of the concept: It was designers, too. Gaming was soon awash in copycat games, many of limited interest. Since then, the mechanic has seen redeployment into other genres of game with mixed results, but there are loads of awesome examples. These are the best deck-building board games out there right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR: The Best Deck-Building Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#slaythespire">Slay the Spire</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#heat">Heat: Pedal to the Metal</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#arnak">Lost Ruins of Arnak</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#star-wars">Star Wars: The Deck-Building Game</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#dune">Dune: Imperium</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#el-dorado">The Quest for El Dorado</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#cubitos">Cubitos</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#quedlinburg">The Quacks of Quedlinburg</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#underdark">Tyrants of the Underdark</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#legendary">Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#dominion">Dominion</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#aeons-end">Aeon's End</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#clank">Clank!

So it's entirely appropriate that there's now a board game version of that game to close the circle. Rules-wise it's very close to its source material as you choose an adventurer and refine their combat deck through a series of tough encounters and merchant visits, climbing the titular spire to fight a terrifying boss. However the parent game is solo only, and a lot of the fun in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/slay-the-spire-the-board-game-review">Slay the Spire: The Board Game</a> comes from the fact that you get to venture into the unknown and battle the gribblies with friends along for the ride.</p></div><p id="heat-pedal-to-the-metal"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Heat: Pedal to the Metal">Heat: Pedal to the Metal</h2></p><div catalogid="b34c3d5f-862d-4b67-ae09-2df14512bd66" id="195818"><div id="195818" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Heat: Pedal to the Metal</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In Heat: Pedal to the Metal, your deck represents the engine of your car, with most cards showing a number of spaces to move. On your turn you can switch gears and then must play the corresponding gear number of cards from your hand, trying to avoid taking corners too fast and spinning off, in a nail-biting race to the finish on your choice of included tracks. Deck building in the basic game is limited to managing heat cards that you take in exchange for extra actions but which clog up your deck, however there's an advanced variant that lets you tinker with your engine deck in all sorts of other satisfying ways for a deeper strategic experience.</p></div><p id="lost-ruins-of-arnak"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lost Ruins of Arnak" id="arnak">Lost Ruins of Arnak</h2></p><div catalogid="12b47414-1a47-426c-9d08-c534eb78cc53" id="180361"><div id="180361" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lost Ruins of Arnak</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph" id="star-wars">Given the ongoing popularity of the Indiana Jones series, it's perhaps surprising that more board games haven't riffed on the adventurous archeaologist, but at least this one that does is an absolute cracker. Players race to gather equipment and companions to make expeditions deeper and deeper into the jungle, braving strange guardians and plundering ruins before feeding their gains back into the next expedition in a cool interplay of daring and forward-planning that's surprisingly strategic once you peel back its interlocking mechanics. One of those is your trusty deck of cards that you'll get to add to by spending your loot, before playing as you plan and execute your expeditions.</p></div><p id="star-wars-the-deckbuilding-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game" id="star-wars">Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</h2></p><div catalogid="def0fa37-840a-4faa-9a9a-34e7e08852fd" id="177415"><div id="177415" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At first sight, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-deckbuilding-game-review">Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</a> looks like a typical example of the genre where you start with a few cards that give you resources, which you spend to buy more cards to beef up your deck. In this instance, you’re looking for offensive cards that damage your opponent’s base as a route to victory. But there are some really fun tweaks to the formula beyond the appealing theme. For starters, you can attack cards before your opponent buys them, denying them good options and earning you a reward. There’s also a very deep well of card variety, with tons of interesting combos between their effects you can explore. Finally, destroying one base isn’t enough: you need three, and you get to pick which ones you use, with their special effects adding another layer to the game’s strategy.</p></div><p id="dune-imperium"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dune Imperium" id="dune">Dune Imperium</h2></p><div catalogid="78ef26ef-33d1-4276-b2fd-590cf3dddef9" id="155275"><div id="155275" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dune Imperium</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-imperium-board-game-review">Dune: Imperium</a> your deck represents resources that your noble house can draw on as you seek power and influence in the universe of Frank Herbert’s sci-fi epic. It’s married to another classic mechanic, worker placement, as each card play sends one of your agents to a board space, either courting influence with a faction like The Guild or The Fremen, or to the planet’s surface, to harvest spice or do battle for territory. It’s a clever melange of thematic and abstract concepts that mesh to create a fascinating whole with many parts to master. There’s also a whole new concept for deckbuilding called reveal turns where you discard your remaining cards to get a secondary effect, meaning you’re building and playing your deck on two different levels at once.</p></div><p id="the-quest-for-el-dorado"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Quest for El Dorado" id="el-dorado">The Quest for El Dorado</h2></p><div catalogid="a4337eee-9d52-427c-b50e-2db0194e4867" id="198605"><div id="198605" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Quest for El Dorado</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is what you get when Reiner Knizia, possibly the most prolific and talented game designer of all time, turns his considerable skills onto deck-building. The result is a seamless blend of deck management and race game as players compete to be the first to make it across the map, matching cards from their deck to terrain hexes on the board in order to move. But of course that’s only half the story: there are hidden surprises in many spaces to upend your strategy and powerful one-shot cards in the market that can make or break your game if timed correctly. Easy to learn, fun to play, but full of interaction and challenge: all the hallmarks of yet another Knizia classic that’s worth its weight in gold.</p></div><p id="cubitos"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Cubitos" id="cubitos">Cubitos</h2></p><div catalogid="52477445-7671-4979-b7a1-7265ba9a1593" id="198606"><div id="198606" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cubitos</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Dominion spawned the whole deck-building subgenre, various games have switched from a deck to a bag of cubes, but Cubitos<em> </em>takes things one step further and allows you to build a collection of actual dice. Your aim is to propel a running racer across the finish line first, but it’s the dice that do the propulsion when you roll the appropriate symbols to move. Other symbols let you buy more dice, thin your collection, even attack and defend with other players. But best of all are the blank faces, which do nothing except let you re-roll them unless you roll all blanks, in which case it’s turn over. With the thrill of rolling huge buckets of dice, the strategy of combining dice types to suit the action, and the addictive terror of push your luck, you’ll be winning with Cubitos even when you lose.</p></div><p id="the-quacks-of-quedlinburg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Quacks of Quedlinburg" id="quedlinburg">The Quacks of Quedlinburg</h2></p><div catalogid="17284768-0988-43e6-bfce-b1a1d8b45546" id="157129"><div id="157129" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each turn of this game (which you may also find re-branded as just plain Quacks), you’ll get the opportunity to add new ingredients to your secret bag, from which you’ll then draw counters to mix in your cauldron in a quest to create the most powerful potion. But watch out: Draw too many bomb counters and your mixture for the round will explode, ending your turn early. This simple premise is set into flight by the fact that you can change the effects of the other counters each game, choosing from a palette of different abilities that dovetail in new and interesting ways, adding more power to your potion and your purchasing ability as you race with your opponents to make the best brew. Add in a slew of other strategic levers to manage, and you’ve got the makings of a modern classic. And once you've mastered the contents of the base game there are all sorts of expansions to mix in, as we explain in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-quacks-of-quedlinburg-buyers-guide">Quacks of Quedlinburg buyer's guide</a>.</p></div><p id="tyrants-of-the-underdark"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tyrants of the Underdark" id="underdark">Tyrants of the Underdark</h2></p><div catalogid="54095bdc-7b22-49e7-9e3b-df59a14ac86c" id="155296"><div id="155296" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tyrants of the Underdark</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tyrants-of-the-underdark-board-game-review">Tyrants of the Underdark</a> is another game where your deck corresponds to assets belonging to a noble house, only this time they’re minions in the employ of Dungeons &amp; Dragons’ fiendish dark elves. Card play spreads your troops, assassins and influence from your starting city over a network of Underdark locations from the well-known fantasy novel trilogy <a href="https://zdcs.link/MgPPg?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Legend of Drizzt</a>. There’s a real sense of struggle as you tussle for territory with other players, card and counter-card adding and removing pieces from the board. Many of the cards represent iconic characters and monsters from the role-playing game with art to match. And there are multiple card sets to combine for new and interesting strategic and tactical options with every play. </p></div><p id="legendary-a-marvel-deck-building-ga"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Ga" id="legendary">Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game</h2></p><div catalogid="ba64de19-1607-413b-9d01-11cb5d637c32" id="164693"><div id="164693" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Legendary does a couple of interesting things with the deck-building formula. For starters, it’s cooperative, with all the players working together to defeat a supervillain, although if you defeat them you can tally points and declare a top, legendary, player. Second, the villain has a deck too, which functions as a game engine and a scenario which dictates the win and loss conditions. You’re not, as you might expect, playing as individual Marvel heroes but rather controlling them as a group with your card plays, recruiting new cards and attacking the villain’s henchmen. It’s a riot of replayability with so many different combinations out of the box, plus it’s fast and smooth with lots of options to fine-tune the challenge level to your group’s needs. There’s a whole series of Legendary games built on the same mechanical engine, including the excellent <a href="https://zdcs.link/kv00W?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game</a>.</p></div><p id="dominion-2nd-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dominion: 2nd Edition" id="dominion">Dominion: 2nd Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="912e22f5-6a33-452d-bf80-12fd40392a7a" id="198818"><div id="198818" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dominion: 2nd Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Or you could start with the deck building game that started it all. Dominion wasn't only novel: It was also simple, with quick, three-step turns. All the complexity is on the cards themselves. The goal is to use the starting copper cards to buy better cards, allowing for more money and actions, working up to buying victory point cards. Strategy comes down to honing your deck into the leanest card-buying machine you can manage. With 25 card options, of which 10 got chosen for use in each game, it also has impressive replay value. Yet it's popular enough to have spawned a slew of expansions, of which <a href="https://zdcs.link/vwMMb?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dominion: Intrigue</a> is often considered the best, but we have a full <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dominion-buying-guide-expansions">Dominion buyer's guide</a> if you want to shop around.</p></div><p id="aeons-end"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Aeon's End" id="aeons-end">Aeon's End</h2></p><div catalogid="c4e046c8-ff49-43e8-bfd5-9b9ba7fd94d9" id="201955"><div id="201955" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Aeon's End</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Aeon's End takes deck-building into the popular category of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative games</a>. It's a smart move: deck-based games are often low on interaction, and having players work together is a solid solution. Here, you're all wizards working together to save a fantasy city from a marauding evil. And there are plenty of cards to heal and buff your fellow players, so there's plenty to think about. Its particular genius, though, is that you flip your discard pile over rather than shuffling when it's empty. This makes the order of card play critical, allowing you to set up combos for the next time you run through your deck. With other timing-based innovations and a tense random turn order, it's thrilling and challenging in equal measure. You can now choose from a variety of sets as we run down in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aeons-end-board-game-buying-guide">Aeon's End buyer's guide</a>, from facing off against demons in the original box to taking on the undead in a longer, more complex campaign with the new <a href="https://zdcs.link/VxPPY?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legacy of Gravehold</a>.</p></div><p id="clank-catacombs"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Clank!

Catacombs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Numbers are at the heart of what makes deck-building work, and they're at the heart of what makes the Clank! series special. Players are adventurers seeking to loot a dungeon and escape before a dragon wakes up. The engine of each hero is their deck, which lets them move and fight, open doors and spend gold. These are just abstract numbers that you use to overcome challenges: The real game is the frantic race in and out of the dungeon. That's where all the themes and thrills are. By separating the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a> from the theme, Clank! manages to satisfy fans of both camps with a winning combination. Clank! Catacombs is the latest and greatest iteration of this series, adding more deck control, more variety and a dungeon built of randomly-drawn tiles to re-create the thrill of exploring the unknown. </p></div><p id="undaunted-normandy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: Normandy" id="undaunted">Undaunted: Normandy</h2></p><div catalogid="f73d6c06-70d4-4669-8a3a-3e6e0df5d169" id="158884"><div id="158884" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: Normandy</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Deck-building has proved a surprising proxy for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">warfare</a> in several games. Undaunted is the best of them, using the flow of cards from your deck as a way to simulate casualties and command confusion on the battlefield. It's a great fit, giving players a real sense of running an infantry platoon from simple rules. Atop the deck-building strategy, there's the extra dimension of moving pieces on the map. This isn't so realistic, but it's still a ton of fun as you tussle over tiles using tactics and dice. A selection of scenarios and troop types ensures there's plenty of replay puzzling as you work the game's layers to gain the upper hand. There are multiple editions of the game to choose from. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Ly1rZ?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Undaunted: Normandy</a> focuses on squad-level combat in France while <a href="https://zdcs.link/pPb1R?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Undaunted: North Africa</a> moves the action to single-soldier special forces and adds rules for vehicles, and for those who'd prefer to avoid the military theme <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-2200-callisto-board-game-review">Undaunted 2200: Callisto</a> is set in a far-future mining colony.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Deck-Building vs Deckbuilding</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Deck-building is a confusing term because it applies to both a genre and a gaming activity, and it means slightly different things in each case. The term originates in collectible card games, the best known of which is Magic: The Gathering. In this realm, deck-building means the process of deciding what cards from your collection you’re going to use in a deck with which to play the game. In the very earliest days of collectible games, before access to the internet was widespread, this was a key part of the strategic appeal of these titles as you had to decide which cards would work well together. Nowadays, it’s increasingly common for players to get deck-building suggestions from the internet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2008 there was a minor revolution in game design with Dominion, which invented deck-building as a genre. It took inspiration from deck-building as an activity but instead of building a deck before you play from a collection, in these games you build your deck while you play, from a market of cards. In many such games, like Dominion itself or Star Wars The Deckbuilding Game, your starting cards include currencies with which to buy new cards. It’s increasingly common to link deck-building to other game mechanics, as Dune: Imperium does, in which case the resource to buy cards may come from one of those other game elements. Either way you’ll get more and more powerful cards as the game progresses and, often, there will be ways to get rid of your weaker starting cards, too, linking the strategy and tactics of deck construction in new and interesting ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re a fan of deck-building in both senses, you might also want to check out <a href="https://zdcs.link/8BVZ8?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Millennium Blades</a>, which uses the deck-building genre to simulate the process of building a collectible card game collection and using it to build decks. It works surprisingly well, is full of fun pop culture references, and features literal wads of paper money to spend. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like these, be sure to check out of picks for the overall <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-deals">best board game deals</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-7-biggest-surprises<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">New video game hardware announcements can become somewhat predictable. With each new generation of consoles you can expect to see near-certain staples like better graphics, faster load times, and new takes on beloved, plumber-and-turtle-oriented franchises.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even Nintendo, which has done this consistently across several generations, from the N64 analog controller, tiny GameCube discs, wacky Wii motion controls and Virtual Console, the Wii U tablet screen, and the Switch’s built-in portability, has delivered these improvements with the Switch 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But being Nintendo, the company again unveiled a few genuine shockers during the Switch 2 Direct.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">It's 2025 and we finally get online play.</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">When I was four years old in 1983, my babysitter used to roll footballs at me like Donkey Kong rolling barrels at Mario. I would jump over them, making a Donkey Kong sound effect in the air, then grab a toy hammer and smash them like Mario. That’s how long I’ve been a Nintendo fan. So I say this from a place of long-suffering experience: it’s going to be impossible to talk about this awesome reveal without revealing a little loving bitterness. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo, as we all know, does not really play online well. Satellaview and Metroid Prime: Hunters aside, Nintendo has barely scraped the surface of what’s possible with a unified multiplayer platform like those created by Sony and Xbox. It’s never as easy to find and talk with friends on a Nintendo platform. Even the Switch required a separate app for voice chat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shockingly, change appears to be here now. During the Direct, Nintendo unveiled GameChat, and it looks... really neat?! It's a four-player chat that supports noise suppression, video cameras for showing friends’ faces, and screen sharing across consoles, allowing you to keep an eye on up to four different displays inside a single screen. We know from the new Switch 2 accessibility features page that GameChat also supports text-to-voice and voice-to-text, allowing players to communicate multiple ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we haven’t seen what, if any, unified matchmaking interface might tie into this just yet. But it’s already a big step, and I’m hoping it means the last nail in the coffin for the abominable friend code forever. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Miyazaki is bringing new blood exclusively to Nintendo</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">When I saw the first frames of this trailer, I thought I was seeing Bloodborne 2. The ambiance, the character design, and the environments all screamed the FROM Software house style. Thanks to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-fans-react-to-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods"><u>Eric Van Allen at IGN</u></a>, I now know that I was watching footage from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods-7-things-we-learned-from-nintendos-interview-with-director-hidetaka-miyazaki">The Duskbloods, a multiplayer PvPvE game </a>designed by the softly-smiling monarch of video game masochism, Hidetaka Miyazaki. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I do not know where this man found time to direct a Nintendo-exclusive game. I’m starting to think that he may never leave his office nor sleep, much like one of his own confused, hollowed characters wasting away in the high tower of some gothic prison. But I’m grateful. FROM doesn’t really miss anymore, so I’m anticipating a tasty treat.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of people who need a vacation, apparently Super Smash Bros. director Masuhiro Sakurai has moved on from Smash to a new Kirby game? Did not see that coming. Get that man a nap!  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Kirby's Air Ride was, to put it bluntly, a pleasant-looking but aggressively unfun Kirby racer for GameCube. But Sakurai has made no secret of his deep affinity for Nintendo’s round, pink elder god, and it’s practically a certainty that a Sakurai-helmed take on the franchise will be a far more refined and enjoyable experience. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Control issues</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It was almost a throwaway moment, but the Pro Controller 2 sounds genuinely Pro this time around when Nintendo announced the Pro Controller 2 has an audio jack now, which is another feature that’s welcome about a decade later. More importantly, they’ve added two mappable extra buttons. I LOVE customizable buttons, so this tiny surprise actually tickled me pink. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">No Mario?!</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This one genuinely shocked me. Near as I can tell, a lot of Nintendo’s Mario makers have been locked up in a secret bunker for years working on his next 3D adventure, which I assumed would be the big summer game for Switch. I was very wrong. Turns out the Odyssey team <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-first-hands-on-preview"><u>is the force behind Donkey Kong Bananza</u></a>, the captivating new 3D platformer with a focus on destructible environments. Nintendo is once again playing against expectations as it so often does, trusting hardcore fans to flock to Donkey Kong’s biggest game in generations and saving Mario for another day.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch will also launch with extensive third party support and Mario Kart World. While World looks like a system-seller, I figured it would be timed as a Christmas-window family game. Nintendo usually leans on Mario, Zelda, or both to sell to their biggest fans during a console’s first year. But Nintendo is looking at Mario Kart 8’s record sales with confidence, betting their most popular party game, alongside Bananza, will help move enough Switch 2 units to make launch a success.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Forza Horizon x Nintendo was not on my bingo card</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Open-world Mario Kart is here, whether it be for good or for ill. I’m betting on good, as the zany physics, weird vehicles, and combat mechanics of Mario Kart should lend themselves well to navigating between and across tracks battling friends and sewing chaos. The short look we got seems to indicate a continuous world a la Bowser’s Fury, but much larger and supporting myriad drivers. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">It’s very expensive</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/does-the-price-of-the-switch-2-overshadow-its-reveal">The Switch 2 costs too much.</a> I get that everything is expensive right now, as tariffs go up, the yen goes down, and American inflation reignites. But $449.99 USD is a hefty price by any standard, and Switch 2 is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-does-switch-2s-price-compare-to-the-cost-of-other-nintendo-consoles-at-launch-spoiler-its-not-the-most-expensive">most expensive launch in Nintendo’s 40-plus US sales history</a>. In fact, Switch 2 costs $150 dollars more than its predecessor’s launch price, and is $100 dollars more than the next-most-expensive Wii U. Successful Nintendo consoles and handhelds have often relied on lower prices as a differentiator, but Switch 2 will be looking to succeed without a price advantage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jared Petty is a former IGN editor who likes writing about how wonderful and silly video games are.
