            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/all-disney-games-on-nintendo-switch-in-order<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-company-disney-owns">multimedia powerhouse</a>, the king of every form of entertainment from movies, TV shows, theme parks, and even video games. Over the last 30 years, The House of Mouse had a hand in creating video game adaptations of some classic Disney movies and original games, like Kingdom Hearts and Epic Mickey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, there are plenty of Disney games on the Nintendo Switch for you to enjoy playing alone or with family and friends. Whether you’re relaxing at home and want to take a break from scrolling through Disney+ or taking a trip to a Disney Park, here's every Disney game for the Switch in release order.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Many Disney Games Are on the Nintendo Switch? </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It can be a little challenging to pinpoint what is and isn't "Disney" these days. In total, <strong>11 Disney games have launched on the Switch</strong> since the handheld released in 2017. Three of those games are movie tie-ins, one is a spin-off of the Kingdom Hearts series, and one is technically a collection of multiple "Disney classics." I don't include them here in the interest of space, but there are also plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-star-wars-games-on-nintendo-switch">Star Wars games on the Switch</a> that technically fall under the Disney umbrella.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Which Disney Game Is Worth Playing in 2025? </h3><div catalogid="d2a33a52-6f6f-4e47-97be-8b0c4ce3372d" id="214796"><div id="214796" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Disney Dreamlight Valley</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Featuring a sticker set, collectible poster, full access to the base game and exclusive digital bonuses.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Not every Disney game is created equal. The combination of "the Disney Brand" with Nintendo Switch games already being pretty expensive means I wouldn't recommend all of the games on this list at their current price points. That said, there have definitely been some winners in the past couple years. If you're looking for a game that makes you feel like you're part of the Disney world, Dreamlight Valley is as good as it gets. The Animal Crossing-like game places you in the position to rebuild Dreamlight Valley with the help of your neighbors, a host of Disney and Pixar characters with their own questlines. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">All Disney and Pixar Games on Switch (in Release Order)</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Cars 3: Driven to Win (2017) </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first Disney game that launched on the Switch is technically a Pixar game that also overlapped with the Nintendo 3DS. In 2017, the media giant released a tie-in game for the movie Cars 3. Naturally, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cars-3-driven-to-win">Cars 3: Driven to Win</a> is a racing game featuring 20 tracks based on locations from the films (including Radiator Springs). The game also includes 20 customizable "characters," some that are automatically unlocked at the start, like Lightning McQueen, while others, like Mater and Chick Hicks, can only be unlocked by winning your way through the five game modes and various Master Events.</p></div><div catalogid="d2a33a52-6f6f-4e47-97be-8b0c4ce3372d" id="214789"><div id="214789" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cars 3: Driven to Win</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">LEGO The Incredibles (2018)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO The Incredibles takes the plotlines of both Incredibles films, released 14 years apart, and merges them into one giant <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-games">LEGO game</a>. Much like the LEGO Star Wars games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-the-incredibles">LEGO The Incredibles</a> contains some deviations from the original source material, like changes to the lore we don’t want to spoil for those who haven’t seen the films (even though you had nearly 20 years to do so), and adds original villains to fight along with Bomb Voyage, Syndrome, and the Underminer. But it’s fun to play through, especially seeing that the LEGO version of Elastigirl can stretch herself as far as her movie version can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is only one of many <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-lego-games-on-nintendo-switch-in-order">LEGO games currently available on the Switch</a>. </p></div><div catalogid="d2a33a52-6f6f-4e47-97be-8b0c4ce3372d" id="214790"><div id="214790" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO The Incredibles</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Disney Tsum Tsum Festival (2019) </h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disney-tsum-tsum-festival">Disney Tsum Tsum Festival</a> is a cute party game inspired by the Disney Tsum Tsum line of collectible toys and the mobile game from Japan, featuring all the Disney and Pixar characters in Tsum Tsum form. The game has 10 different minigames you can play alone or with family and friends, including bubble hockey, curling, and ice cream stacker, among others. You can even play the classic mobile puzzle game with the Switch in a vertical position.</p></div><div catalogid="d2a33a52-6f6f-4e47-97be-8b0c4ce3372d" id="214791"><div id="214791" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Disney Tsum Tsum Festival</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory (2019) </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney and Square Enix’s spin on the latter’s Theatrhythm Final Fantasy lets you take control of Sora, Donald, Goofy, and other characters from across the Kingdom Hearts universe to slash the Heartless and their ilk to the beat of the series’ iconic soundtrack. Enjoy the musical stylings of Yoko Shimomura by yourself, or share the music with your friends in local co-op or online multiplayer battles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the grand scheme of things, Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory gives a recap of the series up to Kingdom Hearts 3 with narration from Kairi, who falls into a deep sleep under Ansem the Wise’s observation after the events of Kingdom Hearts 3’s Re: Mind DLC. Whether you’re a veteran fan of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-games-in-order">Kingdom Hearts games</a> or a newcomer, this game does an excellent job of getting you up to speed in preparation for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-release-date-gameplay-trailer-news">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, which is currently in development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Read our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-melody-of-memory-review"><em>review of Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory</em></a><em>.</em></p></div><div catalogid="d2a33a52-6f6f-4e47-97be-8b0c4ce3372d" id="214792"><div id="214792" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kingdom Hearts Melody of Memory</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Disney Classic Games Collection (2021)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disney-classic-games-collection">Disney Classic Games Collection</a> is an updated edition of 2019’s Disney Classic Games: Aladdin and The Lion King (a mouthful of a title) that includes the Final Cut of Aladdin and the console and handheld versions of The Jungle Book. It has an interactive museum, a rewind function to correct gameplay mistakes, an expanded soundtrack, and a retro-style manual for one of the three games if you buy a physical copy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This compilation lets you relive the game adaptations of your favorite Disney movies the way you played them in the ‘90s no matter which platform you owned at the time, hence the inclusion of the Sega Genesis and Game Boy versions of Aladdin and The Lion King, as well as the Super Nintendo version of the latter. Adding The Jungle Book makes the compilation even more valuable as no one had seen the game since 1994.</p></div><div catalogid="d2a33a52-6f6f-4e47-97be-8b0c4ce3372d" id="214793"><div id="214793" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Disney Classic Games Collection</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Includes multiple versions of the Aladdin, The Lion King, and The Jungle Book games that have been created over the years</p></div></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Disney Magical World 2: Enchanted Edition (Switch Release: 2021)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In hindsight, Disney's Magical World series feels a bit like the precursor to Dreamlight Valley. Originally released for the 3DS, the first two Magical World games let players befriend and complete quests for Disney and Pixar characters with additional farming, crafting, and even combat mechanics. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disney-magical-world-2-enchanted-edition">Magical World 2: Enchanted Edition</a> is a remaster of the second game in the series released specifically for the Nintendo Switch. Like Animal Crossing, the game syncs to your device's clock for seasonal events and quest refreshes.</p></div><div catalogid="d2a33a52-6f6f-4e47-97be-8b0c4ce3372d" id="214794"><div id="214794" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Disney Magical World 2: Enchanted Edition</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Tron: Identity (2023)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Tron: Identity is a visual novel that differentiates itself from other games adapted from the Tron franchise. It reveals another facet of life on the Grid without involving characters from the films, as it is set thousands of years after the events of Tron: Legacy. The game centers on a program named Query, a detective assigned to investigate an explosion in the vault of the Repository, a secure building in the center of the Grid. As the mystery unfolds, the other programs you interact with pose more questions than answers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each character you meet gives you the choice to either ally with them, antagonize them, or derezz them, depending on the dialogue. Plus, you have to complete puzzles in order to ask them more questions about the vault explosion. That’s a lot of detective work to do in three to six hours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Read our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tron-identity-review"><em>review of Tron: Identity</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Disney Speedstorm (2023)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">2023 was a big year for Disney games, but the first release from that year flew a little under the radar. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disney-speedstorm">Disney Speedstorm</a> is a kart racing game featuring some brawling mechanics and, of course, a pretty extensive lineup of Disney characters with unique skills and their own personalized vehicles. Characters are pulled from everything under Disney's umbrella, from the emotions of the Inside Out movies to Jack Sparrow from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pirates-of-the-caribbean-in-order">Pirates of the Caribbean</a>. While the racing mechanics are relatively solid, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-speedstorm-early-access-review">IGN's Early Access review</a> of the game comments on the "absurd" token systems and "gacha-like" in-game economies. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Disney Illusion Island (2023)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Mickey Mouse’s latest gaming adventure from Disney Interactive and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/dlala-studios">Dlala Studios</a> sees him, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy travel to the mysterious Monoth Island for a picnic that turns into a high-stakes mission to recover the three stolen Tomes of Knowledge that helps protect the island. Whether you’re playing in single-player or co-op mode with three additional players, you can play as either character and navigate the island Metroidvania style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney Illusion Island carries the same comedic charm as the recent Mickey Mouse cartoons despite the change in art style. Enjoy the game’s story, the lore of Monoth Island, and the unlockable Mickey Mouse memorabilia scattered around the island.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Read our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-illusion-island-review"><em>review of Disney Illusion Island</em></a><em>.</em></p></div><div catalogid="d2a33a52-6f6f-4e47-97be-8b0c4ce3372d" id="214795"><div id="214795" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Disney Illusion Island</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Disney Dreamlight Valley (2023)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney Dreamlight Valley is a life sim from Gameloft that is basically <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-is-a-game-like-animal-crossing">Disney meets Animal Crossing</a>, where you get to live, work, and play alongside your favorite Disney characters. You play as a human who arrives at the titular Dreamlight Valley, which has been gripped by the Night Thorns, leading to The Forgetting. This supernatural event caused the Disney characters who stayed in the valley to lose their memories while others returned to their home worlds for safety.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You work to rebuild Dreamlight Valley using magic called Dreamlight to weed out the Night Thorns, provide housing for the character via Scrooge McDuck’s construction company, cook food at Remy’s restaurant, and build friendships with everyone, both heroes and villains. The best part is, you never have to worry about your clothes, food, and tools taking up space in your inventory. And you can customize your character with the coolest Disney outfits complete with Mickey Mouse ears just like you were going to Disney World — or Disneyland, depending on where you live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Read our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-review"><em>review of Disney Dreamlight Valley</em></a><em> or check out more </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/jkienlen/lists/the-best-switch-games-like-stardew-valley"><em>games like Stardew Valley for Switch</em></a><em>.</em></p></div><div catalogid="d2a33a52-6f6f-4e47-97be-8b0c4ce3372d" id="214796"><div id="214796" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Disney Dreamlight Valley</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Featuring a sticker set, collectible poster, full access to the base game and exclusive digital bonuses.</p></div></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed (2024) </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The most recent Disney game on the Switch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a> is a remaster of the original Epic Mickey game that launched on the Wii in 2010.
