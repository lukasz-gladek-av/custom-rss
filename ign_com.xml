From an almost lifelike Billie Eilish and an advanced look at GTA 6's Lucia to the sexiest (?) of all Squidwards we've got you covered.

The latest is Patch 5, which brings the drug dealer sim up to version 0.3.3f14.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Patch 5 makes a number of important improvements to the game, of most interest to its many players is the developer’s note that Schedule I’s first content update is set to launch this weekend.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-selling-game-on-steam-right-now-is-schedule-i-an-indie-drug-dealer-simulator-with-more-players-than-monster-hunter-wilds-gta-5-and-marvel-rivals">Schedule I is currently the top-selling game on Steam</a>, with more players than big hitters such as Monster Hunter Wilds, GTA 5, and Marvel Rivals after going viral across social media, Twitch, and YouTube. In the game you go from being a small-time dope pusher to kingpin, manufacturing and distributing a range of drugs throughout the grungy city of Hyland Point. You can expand your empire with properties, businesses, employees, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s developed and published by TVGS, aka Australian indie developer Tyler, who has called Schedule I’s explosive launch “amazing but pretty overwhelming.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I never expected this kind of response!" Tyler said in a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jkigky/comment/mjzluub/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>. "At the moment I’m just trying to stay focussed and get patches out ASAP. Also looking forward to getting started on content updates as soon as all major bugs are patched.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546730838559032913" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patch 5</a> fixes a number of employee bugs, multiplayer bugs, and casino bugs. Tyler has also implemented a number of pathfinding validity checks to hopefully prevent crashes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Schedule I Update 5 version 0.3.3f14 patch notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tweaks/Improvements</strong>
</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added an active display setting to choose which monitor the game displays on.
</li><li>Botanists will now automatically move product from their supplies to drying racks.
</li><li>Owned vehicles are now visible on the map app.
</li><li>Implemented a few validity checks/failsafes for NPC pathfinding and warping. I think this was one of the primary causes of crashing on certain chipsets (thanks to Chi Chi on Discord for bringing this to my attention).
</li><li>Refactored employee item movement behaviour to be a bit smarter.
</li><li>Implemented NPC effects culling at a certain distance to improve performance.
</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">
<strong>Bug fixes</strong>
</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed non-host clients sometimes not being able to hit/stand in blackjack.
</li><li>Fixed a quest UI bug that was sometimes causing infinite loading screens in multiplayer.
</li><li>Fixed clipboard selections not reassigning without first manually clearing the existing selection (employee beds, botanist supplies, etc).
</li><li>Fixed the dealer sometimes preemptively revealing its hand to non-host players in blackjack.
</li><li>Fixed first-person jacket looking janky.
</li><li>Fixed 'Master Chef' achievement being rewarded prematurely.
</li><li>Fixed some property null references that were causing multiplayer loading/desync issues.
</li><li>The drying rack 'dry' button is now non-interactable if the input slot is reserved by an employee.
</li><li>Fixed NPC 'stay in building' behaviour sometimes causing errors for non-host players.
</li><li>Fixed NPC voiceover emitters sometimes throwing a null reference.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Tyler added that sneak peeks at the first content update will be posted soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">See <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/schedule-1">IGN's Schedule 1 guide</a> where you can learn all about the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/schedule-1/Schedule_1_Mixing_Guide">basics of mixing recipes</a> and creating new blends to maximise profit, as well as how to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/schedule-1/Schedule_1_Cheats_and_Console_Commands">access console commands</a>, and the quickest way to jump into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/schedule-1/Schedule_1_Multiplayer:_How_to_Play_Co-Op">multiplayer co-op</a> to take over Hyland Point with friends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
