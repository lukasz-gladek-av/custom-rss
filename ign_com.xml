Apple case that required Apple to enable developers to offer their customers alternative ways to make purchases outside apps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1917716512347152499" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Sweeney put forward a “peace proposal” to Apple, which Epic has battled against in the courts for years now. “If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic,” Sweeney said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-sweeney-says-epic-can-afford-to-keep-spending-billions-fighting-apple-and-google-for-the-future-of-fortnite-on-mobile-for-decades-to-come">IGN reported on how Sweeney had spent billions of dollars fighting Apple and Google over the way the companies run their app stores</a>. Sweeney told IGN at the time that he considered it a long-term investment in Epic and Fortnite’s future, insisting Epic could afford to keep up the fight for decades to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sweeney’s ongoing battle to get Fortnite back on iPhones and Android phones while avoiding paying store fees is well-documented. The gist is this: Epic doesn’t want to pay the now standard 30% store fees on revenue made on mobile games. Instead, it wants to run the likes of Fortnite through its own mobile store, the Epic Games Store, without Apple and Google getting in the way and gobbling up its profit. Back in 2020, this dispute ended up with Fortnite blocked from release on iOS.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in the U.S., nearly five years later Fortnite is finally set to return.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/01/tim-sweeney-1746092302375.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Epic's Tim Sweeney is determined to defeat Apple and Google, however long it takes. Photo by SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In another <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1917706848251134055" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Sweeney hailed the court ruling: “NO FEES on web transactions. Game over for the Apple Tax.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Apple’s 15-30% junk fees are now just as dead here in the United States of America as they are in Europe under the Digital Markets Act. Unlawful here, unlawful there.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apple will now be referred to federal prosecutors for violating the U.S. court order. "Apple’s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated," U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said. "This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gonzalez Rogers referred Apple and one of its executives, Alex Roman, vice president of finance, to federal prosecutors for a criminal contempt investigation into their conduct in the case. Roman gave testimony about the steps Apple took to comply with her injunction that was "replete with misdirection and outright lies," the judge wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apple in a statement said "we strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court’s order and we will appeal."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/01/gettyimages-957063534-1746092530926.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite is finally set to return to iPhones in the U.S., nearly five years after the game was pulled. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After multiple costly legal battles Epic has now made significant progress; prior to this point its victories were mostly limited to Europe via the region's Digital Markets Act.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In August last year, the Epic Games Store launched on iPhones in the European Union and on Android devices worldwide with Fortnite, Rocket League Sideswipe, and Fall Guys for mobile. But actually getting the likes of Fortnite up and running on mobile is a nightmare, with various “scare screens” putting up to 50% of users off, according to Epic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the spending, Epic has suffered significant layoffs. In September 2023, the North Carolina studio saw 830 employees, or about 16% of its workforce, lose their jobs. In October last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-laying-off-830-employees-tim-sweeney-says-fortnite-maker-epic-is-now-financially-sound"><u>Sweeney insisted the company was now “financially sound,”</u></a> with Fortnite and the Epic Games Store both hitting new records in “concurrency and success.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Unfortunately, alongside this news comes the additional confirmation that Codemasters is also “pausing development plans on future rally titles.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The veteran UK racing studio <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc-24/news/wrc-development-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>published the announcement via EA.com.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our WRC partnership was a culmination of sorts for our Codemasters journey with off-road racing, spanning decades through titles like Colin McRae Rally, and Dirt,” reads the studio’s statement. “We’ve provided a home for every rally enthusiast, striving tirelessly to push the boundaries and deliver the exhilarating thrill of driving on the ragged edge. We’ve brought together incredibly talented racing developers, worked with some of the sport’s icons, and had the opportunity to share our love of rallying.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The World Rally Championship itself has <a href="https://x.com/OfficialWRC/status/1917610425153097758" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>acknowledged the news on social media</u></a>, with a largely vague comment noting the “WRC gaming franchise is going in an ambitious new direction with more news coming in the near future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA pulling the pin on Codemasters rally games will be a bitter pill to swallow for motorsports fans following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-reportedly-attempting-to-outbid-take-twos-nearly-1-billion-offer-to-acquire-codemasters"><u>EA’s acquisition of the storied British racing studio back in 2020.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news comes in wake of reports of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn"><u>over 300 layoffs at EA, including roughly 100 at Respawn Entertainment.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Codemasters has been at the spearhead of rallying video games for almost three decades, dating back to 1998’s iconic Colin McRae Rally. The pioneering rally simulation kicked off a series of successful and highly esteemed racing games. Following the death of Colin McRae in 2007, the series retired McRae’s name and continued its evolution as Dirt. 2009’s Dirt 2 (known as Colin McRae: Dirt 2 in Europe and other PAL game territories) marked a transitional point for the series, which was reinvented again as a hardcore simulation in 2015’s Dirt Rally. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">2023’s EA Sports WRC was the first Codemasters rally game to hold an official WRC license since 2002’s Colin McRae Rally 3. IGN’s review notes EA Sports WRC took the class-leading feel of 2019’s Dirt Rally 2.0 and stuffed it into an officially licensed World Rally Championship experience, like a steel rod in Timo Rautiainen’s backside, but its technical gremlins left it feeling like a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-wrc-review">“great racing game trying to fight its way out of an unfinished one.”</a> Subsequent updates sought to improve its screen tearing issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.
