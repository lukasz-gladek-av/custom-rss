            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Save $35 for a limited time.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster Collection just hit its best price ever ahead of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-predictions-and-latest-news">Black Friday</a> sales. It’s sitting at $40 right now, down from the usual $75, which is a clean 47% cut and even beats the recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-2025-sale-top-deals-live">Prime Day</a> offer by another five bucks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Break it down, and the value is absurd. Based on <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/?q=final%2520fantasy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HowLongToBeat</a> times, you’re looking at roughly 30 cents per hour of classic Final Fantasy if you work through the whole bundle. </p><div catalogid="f468f4d5-e228-4975-aea6-e336d85547ce" id="224483"><div id="224483" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In a market where new releases can run you double this package for a fraction of the content, that’s downright generous. These Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 editions also run perfectly on Switch 2 and PS5, so you’re covered on the hardware front.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe you’ve recently discovered Final Fantasy because of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-most-expensive-surge-foils">Magic: The Gathering crossover</a>, and you’re curious where those characters and creatures actually come from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the easiest way to get the full tour. You’re getting the first six games with modern touches like adjustable EXP gain, toggleable encounters, and auto-battle, all of which make these versions the most approachable they’ve ever been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not long ago, the physical edition was one of those almost impossible-to-find collector items. Reprints finally fixed that, and now all six games cost about half the price of a single new release. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I mentioned, it's the best price ever on this collection, so you're getting the best deal possible (backed up by trusted price trackers like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCKFZ1V6?th=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CamelCamelCamel</a>).</p></div><div catalogid="f468f4d5-e228-4975-aea6-e336d85547ce" id="224484"><div id="224484" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition (PS4)</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Should You Wait for Black Friday?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Probably not. When a deal hits an all-time low during the run up to Black Friday, that’s usually the signal that retailers have already fired their biggest shot for deals like this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This collection doesn’t swing up and down like mainstream blockbusters, and Square Enix hasn’t been in the habit of pushing deeper cuts on it outside the major tentpole events. The last meaningful drop was during Prime Day, and this price already beats that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, physical stock also isn’t guaranteed to sit around forever. This is still a niche collector-leaning release, and once the early Black Friday rush cleans out retailers, you’re at risk of FOMO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Black Friday proper knock off another dollar or two? In theory. In practice, retailers use early Black Friday offers to test demand, and if something sells well at an all-time low, they don’t bother dropping it further. So if you’ve been waiting for the right moment to grab this set, in my expert opinion, this is the moment.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Early Black Friday Deals</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Friday discounts are already starting to roll in, and we'll see a whole host of sales go officially live in the next few days across retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big new deals include <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao6MlA?object_uuid=79e35cef-40ce-4bd2-89c0-34d0b8118fe9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$50 off the Meta Quest 3S at Amazon</a>, now $249, or just <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrAgBD?object_uuid=79e35cef-40ce-4bd2-89c0-34d0b8118fe9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$329 for the 256GB version with Batman Arkham Shadow included</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The DualSense Edge controller is also down to just <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXVjGO?object_uuid=79e35cef-40ce-4bd2-89c0-34d0b8118fe9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$159.99 at Amazon</a> today as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.
