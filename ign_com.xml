The studio is warning against issues with fake merch sales around him, but also teasing an official plush Esquie that's in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1922603248415908078" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> from the official Expedition 33 account, Sandfall Interactive said it has seen a number of "suspicious" websites pop up selling Esquie plushies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To be clear: any third-party websites selling Esquie plushies are NOT officially licensed," the studio said. "Many of them are using AI-generated artwork to advertise, and we strongly recommend against purchasing from these sources. They could be scams."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To balance out the wheee with the whooo though, as Esquie might say, Sandfall confirms it is looking into making official Esquie plushies, and wants to get them out as soon as it can. "In the meantime, please be patient — and don’t get scammed!" the studio said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who have played the game probably get why an Esquie plushie might be in high demand. If you haven't gone on Expedition 33 yet, Esquie is a giant helper you meet in Act 1 of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 who becomes both a traveling companion and overworld travel method. He's got the same vibe as Big Hero 6's Baymax.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that in mind, it's easy to see how an Esquie plush might garner some interest, so it's good to know Sandfall is working on an official solution. A cursory search on Google pulled up both an unofficial site, and a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kh8sug/esquie_plush_scam/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">few threads</a> asking about Esquie plush peddlers. If you want the real thing from Sandfall and Kepler, you'll have to wait a bit. No news on whether the real-life plushie will also be filled with wine, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-patch-123-is-a-big-one-nerfs-maelles-game-breaking-stendahl-build">Sandfall Interactive released patch 1.2.3</a> for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, addressing some balance tweaks around Maelle's Stendhal ability. French President Emmanuel Macron also recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/french-president-macron-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-for-creating-one-of-the-best-rated-games-in-history">praised the game</a>, calling its developers a "shining example of French audacity and creativity."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
