            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're still on the hunt for a Switch 2 console, here's a rare opportunity to get one at a discounted price. In fact, this may very well be the only Switch 2 deal we'll see for 2025. AliExpress is offering a genuine <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wR6Ay?object_uuid=01572a01-6e23-42b9-be2f-996e784ab5e0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 console</a> for just $428.99 after you apply a $100 off coupon code "<strong>AEUS100</strong>" or "<strong>USAFF100</strong>" during checkout. Alternatively you can bundle it <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxA4Lk?object_uuid=01572a01-6e23-42b9-be2f-996e784ab5e0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">with the Mario Kart World game</a> for just $452.11 after the same coupon. Both consoles ship free locally from the United States and arrives within 1 to 2 weeks, however you will still have to pay local sales tax.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The catch? Although these are genuine Switch consoles, they are Hong Kong imports. Like all Switch consoles, they are <strong>region unlocked</strong>, meaning you can play them in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. They'll come with a Hong Kong style plug, but a US adapter is included. Imported consoles do not get a US-based Nintendo warranty. AliExpress does include a 90-day free returns window for the Switch 2 console and a 15-day free returns window for the Mario Kart bundle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch 2 Is on Sale at AliExpress</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Brand new, genuine, imported, region unlocked units</strong></em></p><div catalogid="36a3b9f5-2ced-42c2-8fd0-f4fa3b4e7cdd" id="223120"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 console was released on June 5. It is backwards compatible with nearly all Switch 2 games as well as the original Joy-Cons and Switch Pro controller, although the new Switch 2 controllers offer more functionality. In his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2 review</a>, Tom Marks sums up the Switch 2 as "a vital but unexciting upgrade to a console I already love."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two major Switch 2 video games have been released: Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Logan Plant reviewed Mario Kart World</a> and wrote that "Mario Kart World may not make the most convincing case that going open-world was the boost the series needed, but excellent multiplayer racing, incredible polish, and the thrilling new Knockout Tour mode still more than live up to its legacy." <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7xlD?object_uuid=01572a01-6e23-42b9-be2f-996e784ab5e0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a> currently sells for $79 if purchased separately, so it makes a lot of sense to buy it as a combo with the console for only about $23 more ($57 in savings), even if it means going through the workaround process mentioned above.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Donkey Kong Bananza is the Only 10/10 Masterpiece of 2025</h2></div><div catalogid="7e14ca20-d3b4-46c3-be95-0d920f6e2169" id="227037"><div id="227037" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Donkey Kong Bananza</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only did we rate Donkey Kong a 10/10, it's the <em>only</em> game we've given a Masterpiece rating so far this year. In his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Donkey Kong Bananza review</a>, Logan Plant writes that <strong>"</strong>The leader of the bunch is finally back to kick some tail in Donkey Kong Bananza, a brilliant successor to Super Mario Odyssey and a smashing return for a classic Nintendo character. Granted there isn't too much competition in the way of Switch exclusive games for 2025, this has been a fantastic year so far for console gaming in general. We've seen some of the best games released in recent history, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/17/kingdom-come-deliverance-review">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Death Stranding 2</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, all of which got close to a Masterpiece rating but didn't quite hit the mark. That's not to say that Donkey Kong Bananza is necessarily better than those other games since, after all, different people have reviewed each of these games, but it's a testament to just how outstanding Donkey Kong Bananza is on its own merits to have achieved that score.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Abyss has to wait a while longer.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bandai Namco is teasing another remaster of a game in the Tales series, and it sure looks like it's going to be Tales of Xillia.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfIytHHiIyU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upcoming livestream</a> published to the Tales of YouTube Channel, which premieres tomorrow at 7am PT / 10am ET. Currently, the livestream is just a still that reads: "The Next Tales Of Remastered is...?"</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Next Tales of Remastered project will be announced on Aug 19th - 7 AM PT <a href="https://t.co/pIlI4mrGeF" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/pIlI4mrGeF</a> <a href="https://t.co/BiZ7Q42qUV" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/BiZ7Q42qUV</a></p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1957447195914887439?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">However, as has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tales/comments/1mpzywl/tales_of_newsxillia_leak_youtube_screenshots/?share_id=0uqQYmDmE5O1zVvyd5Pxy&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out on social media</a>, a version of this video accidentally went live on the Bandai Namco Europe page a few days ago that showed the remaster to be Tales of Xillia. So it looks like that's what we're getting tomorrow in an early morning livestream, surprisingly hours ahead of Gamescom Opening Night Live later in the afternoon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tales of Xillia first launched in 2011 in Japan and 2013 elsewhere, and follows two characters, Jude and Milla, who uncover a powerful and destructive weapon and set out on a quest to stop its use. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/06/tales-of-xillia-review">gave it an 8/10 back in the day</a>, making it a great candidate for a remaster especially given that it's been a PS3-exclusive up til now and difficult to go back and play. It also sparked a sequel, Tales of Xillia 2, which was similarly locked to PS3.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All that said, some fans will likely be disappointed that this isn't the Tales of remaster they were hoping for. Last year, Bandai Namco <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-graces-f-dev-talks-about-tales-of-the-abyss-remaster-possibilities-and-the-future-of-the-series">announced a Tales of Remastered Program</a>, starting with Tales of Graces f (a Tales of Symphonia remaster was released the year prior). At the time, we asked producer Yuki Ishikawa about the very popular Tales of the Abyss, widely-regarded as one of the best Tales games, and whether it might be up for a remaster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If [a Tales of the Abyss remaster] could happen and I could share that joy with the rest of the fans, that’s something I’ll work hard towards,” Ishikawa said. Meanwhile, I'm over here as the only person carrying the torch for Zestiria, but I can wait my turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
