            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hitman developer IO Interactive has announced that cross-platform progression is finally coming to World of Assassination, allowing you to pick up your stealthy murders wherever you last left off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released exactly five years ago today, Hitman 3 initially launched for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Stadia, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. In the years since, IO's assassination masterpiece has since also launched for Switch 2, iPhone, iPad and Mac. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next month, on February 3, a fresh update will unlock <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> cross-progression across mobile, consoles and PC — though the ability to carry over progress from Hitman 2 will cease as a result. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cross-Progression will allow you to assign a specific platform as your Primary Account, with your progress there saved to IO Interactive's servers and accessed wherever you log in with your IOI Account. This progression includes:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting, however, that Cross-Progression does not mean Cross-Purchase. So, just because you might own the game on PC, don't expect to suddenly be able to fire it on PlayStation. The same goes for its DLC packs, which similarly must be bought for any platform you wish to play their content on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Older saves not tied to your Primary Account won't be deleted, though you will need to toggle off Cross-Progression to regain access to them. Doing so will let you pick up your older save specific to that platform. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hitman: World of Assassination - Signature Edition Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One wrinkle to all this is the end of IO Interactive's ability to carry over progression from Hitman 2 to Hitman 3. The ability to do this will end on February 3, alongside the addition of Cross-Progression. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This guarantees data integrity and prevents conflicts between legacy progression systems and the new unified WOA progression," IO Interactive wrote in a <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/blogs/2026/cross-progression-coming-to-hitman-woa-and-new-look-to-ioi-account" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> on the changes. "Past February 3rd 9:00 UTC players won’t be able to proceed to the Hitman 2 to Hitman 3 carryover, giving you two weeks to proceed to the carryover if you are yet to do so."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IO Interactive has three main productions right now: ongoing work on Hitman: World of Assassination, including work on a co-op mode, James Bond blockbuster 007 First Light, and a new fantasy IP appropriately codenamed Project Fantasy. Beyond all that, there are also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/of-course-theres-going-to-be-a-hitman-4-developer-io-interactive-says">plans to release Hitman 4 — eventually</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Block rocking beats expectations.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The chief developer behind the saving of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has celebrated the game’s early access launch, declaring: “I have no regrets.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hypixel Studios founder Simon Collins-Laflamme issued an update a week on from Hytale’s release on PC (check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hytale-review-early-access">IGN's Hytale early access review so far</a> to see what we think). He said saving the game and releasing it had been “the most challenging but rewarding experience of my life.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale has endured a tumultuous development. It was announced in December 2018 with a trailer that so far has an incredible 62 million views on <a href="https://youtu.be/o77MzDQT1cg?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube</u></a>. The idea was to expand on the likes of Minecraft by combining the scope of a sandbox with the depth of a roleplaying game, all set in a procedurally generated world.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Excitement around Hytale was fueled by the experience of the developers themselves, who co-founded Hypixel, one of the most influential Minecraft servers in the world. League of Legends developer Riot Games invested in the project and, in 2020, bought the studio outright.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in June last year development on Hytale stopped and Hypixel Studios began winding down operations. It was thought Hytale was canceled, destined never to release. But in November, Riot confirmed it had sold the rights to Hytale back to Collins-Laflamme as this "gives players the best chance to one day experience a revised version of the game they've been waiting for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2006090043665088900" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>statement</u></a> published at the end of 2025, Collins-Laflamme expressed his "anger" at what had happened to Hytale over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The game has insane potential, but four years of engineering went into rebuilding the engine rather than gameplay features," he said. "That leaves us with a four-year gap and a lot of catching up to do, and that rebuilt engine is never gonna be used.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When you don’t invest in gameplay, you don’t just lose time. You lose momentum, iteration, and player feedback. Now the focus has to be on gameplay first and rebuilding trust by actually shipping things at a rapid pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s a damn miracle we were able to salvage Hytale. It was barely playable. All basics were broken. Camera, movement, combat, crafting, building, gameloop, sounds, rendering. Everything, everything was wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It should have taken years to fix, but within weeks, we got the game into a playable, fun state. And now, instead of slowing down or celebrating a release, we have to keep pushing for years to make up for the time that was lost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So yes, I feel anger. And I’m turning that into focus and execution. I’m committing more money, more time, and personal sacrifice to deliver the game this vision deserves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to the early access launch, and it sounds like all the heartache was worth it. Even before the early access launch, Collins-Laflamme said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hytale-isnt-even-out-yet-and-its-already-made-enough-money-to-cover-the-next-2-years-of-development-costs">Hytale had already made enough money to cover the next two years of development</a>. And now, he’s told fans he can call the launch a success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s now been seven days since early access launch and I can confidently say that I have no regrets saving Hytale, it’s been the most challenging but rewarding experience of my life,” Collins-Laflamme said in <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2013636980626595976" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on X / Twitter</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thank you everyone for the amazing support, and a big thank you for the rebuilt Hytale team for trusting me to get this to the finish line in just a few months. I haven’t been involved with Hytale development for many years and coming back was a big unknown and risk for me, and my family. I fully trusted the people and it just worked. Amazing team, every single one made a big difference.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Work on updating Hytale continues, with Update 2 coming this week.
