And, given the increasing importance of the PC for a multiplatform game’s success, is GTA 6’s no-show on PC a missed opportunity or even a mistake?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN put that question to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick ahead of the company’s recent financial results, and in his response he teased GTA 6’s <em>eventual</em> release on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So with Civ 7 it's available on console and PC and Switch right away,” Zelnick said of Firaxis' recently launched Civilization 7. “With regard to others in our lineup, we don't always go across all platforms simultaneously. Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar fans have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years. Still, some had hoped that a game as big as GTA 6 could be a turning point for the studio's PC gaming attitude.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Rockstar titles tend to get to PC eventually, but the question of how long PC gamers will have to wait for what could end up being one of the biggest games ever remains. Given GTA 6’s fall 2025 release window, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">which Take-Two is still confident in</a>, it seems likely PC players won’t get to play the game until 2026 at the earliest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstar <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-rockstar-dev-tries-to-explain-why-gta-6-is-coming-to-pc-after-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s"><u>attempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hits PS5 and Xbox Series X and S</u></a>, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how big of a missed opportunity could skipping PC for GTA 6’s launch be? Zelnick told IGN that the PC version of a multiplatform game can generate 40% of overall sales, or even more with certain games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That stat came as part of a discussion about the current console generation, which has seen sales of the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S — the two consoles GTA 6 launches on later this year — plummet. While Nintendo has the Switch 2 waiting in the wings, neither Sony nor Microsoft have announced their next-gen consoles. How long before the industry needs the PlayStation 6 and whatever Xbox is next?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelnick pointed to the PC platform as growing in importance, even as console sales fall, while publishers wait for Sony and Microsoft’s next moves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue,” he said. “Of course, there will be a new console generation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In any case, according to Zelnick, the release of GTA 6, which is expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time, will drive console sales as fans jump into the current generation for the first time in order to play the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you have a big title in the market and we have many of them coming, historically that has sold consoles,” Zelnick said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I think that will happen this year. I don't think tariffs are going to be our friend, but I think there will be a meaningful uptick in console sales in calendar 25 because of the release schedule, not just coming from us, but coming from others. So I'm not concerned about that [console sales falling]. I think the trend that you'd want to focus on is this increasing share of the market that is reflected in PC.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, many see the PlayStation 5 Pro as a future 'GTA 6 machine,' in the hopes it will be the best platform to play the game when it comes out. However, tech experts believe <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts">the PS5 Pro probably won't run GTA 6 at 4K60</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-react-to-kendrick-lamars-super-bowl-playstation-easter-egg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Football fans spent months preparing for Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl LIX halftime show, but no one was expecting to see the artist take another dig at Drake with a stadium-sized PlayStation Easter Egg.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the rapper’s set went off as expected. While the crowd cheered to spins on hits from records like DAMN and GNX, appearances from stars like Samuel Jackson and SZA helped take the show to new heights. Of course, there were plenty of references to Lamar’s infamous 2024 beef with Drake, too, but what audiences didn’t expect was how the Super Bowl performer chose to finally close the door on the former Degrassi star. As the lights went down, the words “Game Over” could be seen illuminated on the side of the stadium, while the stage was revealed to feature PlayStation’s iconic cross, circle, triangle, and square symbols.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show was always going to be seen as a victory lap when it came to his beef with Drake, but bringing Sony into the fight to finally close that chapter in grand fashion felt especially brutal. Although it’s not quite clear why the To Pimp a Butterfly artist chose to seemingly channel PlayStation for the end of his year-long fight, music and gaming fans have taken to social media to share their appreciation for the dig nonetheless. At the very least, Lamar’s already great performance might be better on rewatch once you realize the stage is one big video game reference.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Kendrick Lamar brought out the PlayStation symbols and said "Game Over" 😭<a href="https://t.co/MfkDEJ1F9G" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/MfkDEJ1F9G</a></p>— KAMI (@Okami13_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1888766562750148721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">the stage for Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl performance has the PlayStation controller buttons 😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/DnkrJGRDtI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/DnkrJGRDtI</a></p>— Radec (@realradec) <a href="https://twitter.com/realradec/status/1888764872353022049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Serena Williams, Samuel Jackson, PlayStation references, the GNX, the whole stadium yelling "AMINORR" ugh the dancers in red, white &amp; blue, SZA?!

Aside from its surprise spot in the Super Bowl halftime show, the gaming company found itself making headlines on Friday and Saturday morning when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-psn-down-february-2025">gamers were locked out of accessing PSN for an extended period of time</a>. The unscheduled event saw fans unable to play any online titles for around a full day, resulting in one of the longest periods of downtime since the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/04/21/one-year-later-reflecting-on-the-great-psn-outage">infamous outage of 2011</a>. PlayStation was eventually able to bring PSN back online later yesterday and has stated it will be gifting PlayStation Plus users an additional five days onto their subscriptions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the Super Bowl still has time to go, and that means more trailers and commercials for some of the biggest movies and TV shows of 2025. Highlights so far include teasers for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-rebirth-super-bowl-trailer-reveals-more-dinosaur-carnage-ahead-of-summer-premiere">Jurassic World Rebirth</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning-super-bowl-trailer-packs-in-nostalgia-and-more-tom-cruise-stunts">Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thunderbolts-reappears-with-action-packed-super-bowl-trailer-and-a-first-look-at-sentry">Thunderbolts*</a>.
