The push your luck card and dice game by Mantic Games is a fun, pick-up-and-play experience for two or more players. It comes in a relatively small box, making it a good small gift or game to take on camping trips to pass the time. With season 3 of Prime Video's Invincible animated show now over, this sale is the perfect opportunity to spend more time with these characters and the Invincible universe.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Invincible: The Dice Game Deal on Amazon Today</h2><div catalogid="0f16c122-5ccd-4d6f-97dd-b9089e6c0195" id="218922"><div id="218922" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Invincible: The Dice Game is 44% off on Amazon</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are looking to join the Guardians of the Globe by assuming the role of new recruits, taking on other heroes and fighting various villains. Earn enough reputation points, and you win. Be warned, however: your resources are limited to the amount of dice available in your pool, so strategy is the name of the game.

A lot happens in these episodes – Mark wrestles with the ethics of killing, other characters die or nearly die, and new villains arrive from other galaxies or dimensions – even though little of it feels conclusive. The door is left open to several possible developments – especially when it comes to Mark’s evolving morality." Season 4 of the popular Image comics adaptation will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-season-4-should-premiere-in-2026-as-amazon-teases-thragg-casting">likely arrive in 2026</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">See more board game recommendations</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.
