            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-game-awards-nomination-sparks-renewed-debate-among-fans<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The full list of Game Awards 2024 nominees has dropped, and one release in particular has been sparking plenty of discussion on social media and elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-complete-list-of-nominees-goty">Since the nominees were revealed Monday morning</a>, fans have been discussing whether Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree deserves to be on a list that also includes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-review">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc">Black Myth Wukong</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/balatro-review">Balatro</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>. They mainly point to it being an expansion pack that can only be accessed by completing the main game, making it less of a standalone experience than comparable ones like The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As amazing as Shadow of the Erdtree was, it getting a GOTY nom just kind of rubs me the wrong way. Yes, it was expansive, but it wasn't the first DLC for a game to be giant. Witcher, Xenoblade, Cyberpunk, etc. Would've rather seen an <em>actual</em> game," one fan wrote on Reddit in what has become a common sentiment online. Others simply memed the decision.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Elden ring dlc in goty nominations <a href="https://t.co/y47ujBGgCe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/y47ujBGgCe</a></p>— Jonah (@NahImGhost) <a href="https://twitter.com/NahImGhost/status/1858558736249348356?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Awards has made it clear that Shadow of the Erdtree falls within its official selection criteria. Its website includes a statement issued today reading: "The Game Awards aims to recognize the best creative and technical work each year, irrespective of the format of that content’s release. Expansion packs, new game seasons, DLCs, remakes and remasters are eligible in all categories, if the jury deems the new creative and technical work to be worthy of a nomination. Factors such as the newness of the content and its price/value should be taken into consideration."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Certainly, there's no doubt that Shadow of the Erdtree is one of the biggest releases of 2024. We awarded it a 10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">our review</a>, writing, "Erdtree’s absolutely jam-packed with secrets, valuable treasures, challenging boss battles, and horrific monstrosities to face off against, as well as cool new weapons, spells, Ashes of War, Spirit Ashes, talismans, and more to play around with and use to find even more novel ways to tackle its memorably brutal battles. Add on some very interesting lore revelations, not to mention the same spectacular visual design and stellar music that accompanies its larger-than-life bosses, and you’ve got what is certainly one of the best DLC expansions I’ve ever played."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also not light on content, clocking in at a cool 51 hours for a completionist run on IGN's sister site <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/139385" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HowLongtoBeat</a>. It came in second in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/faceoffs/whats-your-game-of-the-year-2024-so-far/results/community">community GOTY Face-Off</a>, surpassed only by fellow nominee Black Myth Wukong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm a bit 'eh' about DLCs being nominated, but SOTE is my favourite release of the year and is a very substantial gaming experience so I'm fine with it (not that I played the others lol)," <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-game-awards-2024-goty-nominees-revealed-astro-bo[%E2%80%A6]-elden-ring-sote-ff-vii-rebirth-metaphor-refantazio.1038660/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one fan wrote</a>. "Obviously it couldn't function as a standalone game in its current state, but on the other hand, everyone's been saying that Fromsoft could have easily released it as a sequel, it took almost 2.5 years to make, and it cost $40. It's not really setting much precedent for a typical 6-12 months, 5-10 hour Fromsoft DLC to be nominated in the future. Like, they will still be lower down the list for being too iterative or not expansive enough."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">WHAT CHICANERY! FOR YEARS, DLCS HAVE NEVER COUNTED, BUT NOT OUR FROMSOFT! ANYTHING FOR PRECIOUS FROMSOFT! SILENT HILL 2 BLEW EVERYONE'S EXPECTATIONS OUT OF THE WATER AND THE $40 DLC GETS TO BE A NOMINEE? WHAT A SICK JOKE! <a href="https://t.co/Lq7Z0M60cf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Lq7Z0M60cf</a> <a href="https://t.co/Xed9XdddLo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Xed9XdddLo</a></p>— Chris Voiceman (@ChrisVoiceman) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisVoiceman/status/1858573127841665119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Still, some remain skeptical, calling for The Game Awards to add a "Best Expansion" category to account for highly rated releases like Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. Plenty of others feel that other well-received releases such as Animal Well have been snubbed to make room for Shadow of the Erdtree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One way or another, Shadow of the Erdtree figures to take home some hardware when The Game Awards streams on December 12. In addition to Game of the Year, it was also nominated for Best Game Direction, Best Art Direction, and Best RPG. Astro Bot and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth led the with seven nominations apiece.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stay tuned for lots more GOTY coverage as 2024 comes to a close, and make sure to check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-reviewed-games-of-2024">list of the best video games of 2024 so far</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

Right now you can get it without heatsink for $129.99 or with heatsink (at <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAV6eb?object_uuid=c22c6669-3acd-407d-a8b6-f9523ca0c4d5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart</a>) for $134.99. The WD Black SN850X is one of the best performing PCIe 4.0 SSDs on the market; this is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-ssd">best SSD for your PlayStation 5 console</a>, but it can also be a blazing fast boot drive for your gaming rig.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2TB WD Black SN850X PS5 SSD (Without Heatsink)</h2><div catalogid="7802e9e7-6a2b-4ead-a7ae-1ee8af772012" id="200160"><div id="200160" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>WD Black SN850X 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">2TB WD Black SN850X PS5 SSD (With Heatsink)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d8fe4dc-95eb-4e0c-9293-5792ccaff9b1" id="175040"><div id="175040" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>WD Black SN850X 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD with Preinstalled Heatsink</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/wd-black-sn850x-nvme-ssd">SN850X</a> is the latest generation of WD's flagship Black series M.2 SSDs. In terms of performance, it's considered a top-tier SSD with sustained read speeds of up to 7,300MBps, write speeds of 6,600MBps, random read speeds of up to 1,200K IOPS, and write speeds of 1,100IOPS. It's faster than the previous generation SN850 thanks to newer flash chips (BiCS5 vs BiCS4) and an updated firmware. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you plan to install this in your gaming PC, WD includes Game Mode 2.0 utility software that's designed to tune the SSD for better performance during gaming sessions. Unless you have an unlimited budget, 2TB is the size I would recommend for a boot solid state drive; for most people, this is plenty of space for your OS and apps, and the price is still reasonable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The SN850X also makes for an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-ssd">excellent SSD for your PlayStation 5 console</a>. It's identical to Sony's officially licensed WD SN850P SSD. It more than fulfills all of Sony's PS5 recommendations, including a M.2 2280 form factor, minimum 5,500MB/s speed, and PCI-E Gen4x4 interface. You can get the version with the pre-installed heatsink for $10 more, or you can just pick out a <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVDjed?object_uuid=c22c6669-3acd-407d-a8b6-f9523ca0c4d5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">cheaper heatsink</a> (it's very easy to install). The SSD comes with a five-year warranty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't yet own a PlayStation console, fret not because there are some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-slim-console-black-friday-2024">fantastic PS5 deals coming for Black Friday</a>. Sony recently unveiled a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J40QG4CVaww" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Play Has No Limits | PS5”</a> ad promoting a special holiday price for the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdd6Mj?object_uuid=c22c6669-3acd-407d-a8b6-f9523ca0c4d5&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=721116655.1681141708" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5 Slim (Digital) at $379.99</a>. The deal is set to run through <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> and expire after December 24.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should You Wait for Black Friday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That is a great question. We will unquestionably see more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ps5-ssd-deals-for-2024">SSD deals</a> on November 29. The WD SN850X, however, is one of the fastest SSDs on the market and if you're looking for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssd">best of the best</a>, we think there's a slim (although not zero) chance that you'll find a better deal. However, if you're more flexible and willing to buy an SSD that isn't quite the best, but still fast enough to fulfill all of Sony's recommended PS5 specs, then you should wait and find a deal that's closer to $100.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
