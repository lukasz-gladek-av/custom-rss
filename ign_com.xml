            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-patch-22-fully-revealed-and-its-out-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt has unveiled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> patch 2.2, which significantly expands the game’s customization options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed in partnership with support developer Virtuous, 2.2 is called ‘Express Yourself,’ with the idea that players can express themselves more in-game. The update launches today, December 10, with <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51028/update-2-2-is-live" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes</a> below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-gets-surprise-update-22-cd-projekt-still-has-some-gas-in-the-tank">CD Projekt had previously clarified</a>, 2.2 does not add a new game plus feature to Cyberpunk 2077, nor PlayStation 5 Pro support. 2.2 does, however, let players change the colors of more cars in a more detailed way, with an upgraded vehicle customization user interface. The new TwinTone feature lets you scan any car in Night City and add its paint job to your car. The idea is if you’re driving around and see a cool car, you’ll be able to save its paint job in a database and from there apply it to your cars. This adds a paint job collecting and exploration aspect to Cyberpunk 2077 gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are gameplay implications, too - if you change the color of your car while you’re being chased by the police, you’ll fade out your heat level. So, you can escape into an alley, change your color, then drive away Scott free.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">10 cars previously unavailable to buy or own will be added to the Auto Fixer website, eight to the base game and two to the Phantom Liberty expansion. Sticking with cars, Johnny Silverhand, played by Keanu Reeves, will now spawn next to you in the passenger seat around 25% of the time. The idea here is to increase the presence of Johnny while playing, reinforcing the fact he’s stuck in V's brain. He’ll make comments, too, some of which are insults. Johnny will not spawn when you’re in combat, when another NPC is sat in the passenger seat, or when you’re on main story quests (since he’s usually involved in those) but CD Projekt said you’ll see him quite a bit. You’ll be able to use photo mode when Johnny is sat next to you, too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/10/46ded1252b3630bb68a6c94e3dffc2e7f9a8070f-1733852649358.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Expect Johnny to pop up while you're driving around Night City. Image credit: CD Projekt.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of photo mode, the camera is much improved. It now has a drone mode letting it fly around farther due to a bigger range. You can disable collisions, too, to help nail that perfect shot. The new aspect ratio feature is PC only, unfortunately, due to limitations with the consoles. There are new lighting options, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2.2 will let you spawn up to three NPCs from a list of 20 characters taken from the base game and Phantom Liberty in photo mode. Smasher is one of the NPCs you can spawn, complete with unique poses, so you’ll be able to have your revenge on him if you want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generally, photo mode has a reworked user interface, with additional depth of field options. CD Projekt hopes that the improvements to photo mode will mean players won’t need to rely on mods or other external software to take their in-game pictures.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/10/a60c7f9aa43a5da541ff4f592c5b0aae5a13364e-1733852711059.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Photo mode is expanded with 2.2. Image credit: CD Projekt.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a new gallery you can display in your apartment to show off your snaps. So you can hang a picture of your date with Panam up on the wall for… future reference, if you fancy it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to the character creator, there are 112 new assets available for customization of V. Eight new face plates are available, so you can make your character look like they’re a member of The Mox if you’d like. New nail and even lip designs are in there, too, lifted from the various corporations in Cyberpunk 2077, and loads of new eyes (including double eyes). There’s a new randomizer, too, with a ‘plain to punk’ slider to influence what it might spit out. You can lock specific assets, too, then continue with the randomizer.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/10/c68a06b50462354026e633910bdc9ea36855844a-1733852807659.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Character creation is much improved. Image credit: CD Projekt.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During a <a href="https://youtu.be/MIlOthAEggI?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community broadcast</a>, game director Paweł Sasko teased additions CD Projekt will let fans discover for themselves. There are a “bunch of new things that happen in the city,” which will no doubt set players on a hunt throughout Night City. There are a couple of secrets Sasko has yet to see appear online even from the base game, so there’s plenty to work towards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this the true end for Cyberpunk 2077? CD Projekt has yet to say. 64 staff at CD Projekt are working on Orion, the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-enters-full-scale-production-cyberpunk-2077-hits-30-million-copies-sold">but most are working on The Witcher 4</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cyberpunk 2077 update 2.2 patch notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Update 2.2 for Cyberpunk 2077 is being rolled out on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this patch you’ll be able to express yourself like never before — it includes over 100 new customization options for V, adds CrystalCoat™ compatibility for select vehicle brands, introduces a brand-new TWINTONE™ color scheme feature for CrystalCoat™-compatible vehicles, and more!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/undaunted-2200-callisto-board-game-review.1057095/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-2200-callisto-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Undaunted: Normandy was a surprise smash hit back in 2019 thanks to its novel marriage of building a deck of action cards in-game that you then played to command squads of soldiers on a board. It spawned several spin-offs with the same World War II theme, including the aerial Undaunted: Battle of Britain and the stupendous campaign version <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-stalingrad-board-game-review"><u>Undaunted: Stalingrad</u></a>. (Those games are so exceptional, by the way, they landed on our lists of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">best war board games</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">best deck-building games</a>.)</p><div catalogid="28c1399f-0d35-4a4d-8f76-2c41ce739634" id="213093"><div id="213093" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted 2200: Callisto Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However, right back to the original, some players who were uncomfortable reducing real-life conflict to a game wanted a sci-fi version. Now their wish has been granted, as the same systems have been ported to the fight for an icy, mineral-rich moon between miners and their corporate overlords in Undaunted 2200: Callisto</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What’s in the Box</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Undaunted 2200: Callisto arrives in a very heavy box, and those familiar with the previous entries in the series may be surprised to find the weight is mostly down to four double-sided, fold-out boards, replacing the modular board tiles of the original.  While this reduces the number of maps you can fight on it is, for the most part, a positive change making setup easier and the boards better looking, with clear space demarcations and helpful information printed around the edges. The board art is suitably dark, cold and futuristic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some other surprises await. Alongside the 10-sided dice that the series has always used are a collection of eight- and 12-sided ones, used with one of this entry’s new rules, shooting at different elevations. This is also the first entry to contain a dedicated solo rule book, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solitaire play</a> being available only via an expansion previously. There are also game rules and a scenario booklet which are clear and concise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beneath these are more familiar components. There are a couple of sheets of punch-out tokens and standees, which represent foot units and vehicles, respectively. There are also two large decks of cards, one for each faction, which you’ll use to command your troops. The art on these is detailed and atmospheric but has one problem: most of the figures depicted are in space suits, which makes them feel weirdly anonymous and identikit, despite efforts being made to visually differentiate the two factions. This, alongside the black-on-yellow and white-on-blue of the counters, can also make it a little awkward to tell at a glance exactly what unit under your command is what.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How it Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The core gameplay remains unchanged, so veterans of the series can dive right in. Each scenario gives you a list of cards for your starting deck, and a bigger pool of cards you can incorporate into your deck during play. At the start of each turn, both players draw four cards and pick one to bid for initiative, with more powerful cards having a higher bid value. Going first can have a huge impact on how the turn unfolds, and the loser’s card is wasted, so this is a rapidly repeating dose of tension. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your other cards can be a mix of combat and command cards. Playing the former allows you to activate the corresponding counters on the board to do things like move and attack. The latter let you either choose new cards to add to your deck, or sometimes to draw more cards or re-activate units for a second action in the same turn. How you choose to use command cards is a fascinating <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategic</a> puzzle that depends on the scenario and the state of your forces. The more cards you add, the slower your deck will cycle and the less likely it is you’ll get complementary cards in your draw, but it also gives units more staying power in a game where eliminating enemies is often a victory condition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to activating troops, you can’t just rush for objective spaces, or into combat with foes. Before most counters can reach a space, it has to be marked as scouted, which is the preserve of cards with the matching action, generally recon and navigation units. Once scouted, heavier units can move in and use an action to control the space, which is the other key victory condition in most scenarios. This sets up a constant stress over how to most effectively move and utilize the forces at your disposal. Each space has a defensive bonus, and the need to scout often leaves counters in vulnerable positions before they can creep into safely. Similarly, you often want your soldiers to be attacking, not spending precious actions to take control of spaces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the new game aspects add pieces to this tactical puzzle. Most noteworthy is a simple elevation system, where clearly marked spaces and platforms are treated as one level above standard spaces. Firing up a space means you’re rolling an eight-sided <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dice-rolling-board-games">dice</a> against the target number of the counter’s defense, plus the range, plus the bonus printed on the space they’re in. Firing down gets you a 12-sided dice, whereas the same elevation uses 10-sided dice. When target numbers are generally six or more, that variation makes a huge difference, meaning the fight over elevated spaces can be vicious, diverting your attention away from the objective spaces that can win you the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other major change is the addition of space-specific actions, which are also printed on the board. Most commonly these are doors which you can spend an action to open, or to attack, removing them permanently, although some scenarios have laser turret spaces you can use to make a powerful attack. Between these action spaces and the elevation rules, Undaunted 2200: Callisto answers another common request from fans of the series for more interactive terrain rules. Like everything else in the game, the designer’s solution is streamlined yet effective, adding variety and depth to play with minimal extra rules overhead.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Undaunted 2200: Callisto answers another common request from fans for more interactive terrain rules.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Vehicles are another example of this thought process at work. They have a shield printed round their defensive values, which essentially means they’re immune to small-arms fire. Some attack options have values to use against soft foot units, while others can attack these armored targets: often the ranges and values are different. A mining Ripper unit, their standard troop, rolls one die at any range against soft targets, but gets two dice against armored targets in the same hex, for example. Vehicle units can be very powerful, not only in terms of firepower but also flexibility, and so become yet another move in the interlocking circles of prioritization that bedevil all your choices in this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Units also get plenty of variety. In addition to the standard scouts, solider and machine-gunners that you meet in the first scenario, later units add additional effects such as area attacks and suppressing fire, or the ability to transport other troops with them for fast deployment. It’s also noteworthy that there’s more asymmetry in the units available to both sides than there were in earlier Undaunted games. The scouts available to the corporate player, for instance, move faster but have more limited attack options compared to their mining counterparts. This minor asymmetry is a welcome addition, making trying out each side in a scenario a much more interesting prospect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the sci-fi trappings, and the presence of mechs and laser turrets, this still feels like a pre-modern skirmish game. There are no awesomely powerful sci-fi weapons to leverage on either side, no cool technologies to harness, just re-themed rifles and machine guns. This, of course, betrays the roots of the game in World War Two. It doesn’t really spoil the game – getting up close and personal enhances the tactical options available, and you could make the same arguments about perhaps the most popular sci-fi tabletop game around, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-fireteam-review">Warhammer 40k</a> – but some players may find it disappointing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo</a> version plays well, although the overhead in following simple flowcharts for each unit, specific to each scenario, is a bit of a pain. The payoff is a mute enemy that makes tactically sensible choices, often offering clues as to the best way to approach any given scenario. There’s also a new team game for four which works surprisingly well, in which the troops on each side are subdivided into two decks, with teammates swapping the lead role in bidding for initiative each time. Splitting forces like this makes the chances of piecing together combos you might need in any given turn less likely, can be frustrating but also very exciting, and leads to emergent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">co-operative</a> decision-making.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6b1M2?object_uuid=54e9ca3c-ed76-4467-bbc5-168d41d55d88&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 10, 2024 3:38 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Undaunted 2200: Callisto is the fifth full game in the series, and veterans of the entire franchise are going to be on the fence about the new aspects on offer here. There is enough novelty to get jaded fans excited about another entry, but only just. The core gameplay of exciting tactical encounters wrapped in a lightweight layer of strategic deck management is very much the same. The good news is that those attracted to this series for the first or second time thanks to that sci-fi makeover will discover that that core gameplay is fantastic, a seamless blend of layers that even manages to conjure theme and narrative from its simple rules. Each scenario presents new challenges to overcome, feels different from each asymmetric side, and different again with two or four players. It’s an impressive achievement to have squeezed this much originality out of an old series, and you suspect this dynamic design duo will have more tricks up their sleeve to propel it even further into the future.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
