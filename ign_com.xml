            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Naughty Dog is allegedly requiring most of its developers working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet to work a minimum of eight extra hours per week, in an effort to meet a deadline for an internal demo that will be reviewed by Sony.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg report</a>, which claims that beginning in late October, Intergalatic developers have been required to work at least eight hours a week, though not more than 60 hours total per week, and to log their time in an internal spreadsheet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those developers have also been asked to work from the office five days per week, where previously the requirement had only been three days per week, with up to two days work-from-home. This has caused some to have to scramble to find childcare and pet care arrangements that were previously not needed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mandatory overtime is in service of finishing an internal demo in time for a review by Sony, after said demo missed multiple deadlines. Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet does not currently have a public release date or window set, but Bloomberg's report suggests internally it is targeting mid-2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The report concludes that the mandated overtime ended this week, and Naughty Dog will return to just three days a week mandated in-office ithrough the end of January, with a more detailed schedule to come.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Naughty Dog has been notorious for crunch over the years on series such as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/were-definitely-at-the-point-where-somethings-gotta-give" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncharted</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/as-naughty-dog-crunches-on-the-last-of-us-ii-developer-1842289962" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Last of Us</a>, with the studio even openly hiring for individuals who would be willing to crunch. In 2021, studio co-presidents Evan Wells and Neil Druckmann addressed the issue in an <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2021/08/28/naughty-by-nature-naughty-dog-leadership-reflects-on-the-studios" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Game Informer</a>, saying that while they wanted to prevent burnout, they didn't want to impose a one-size-fits-all restriction on employee passion and creativity. That same year, the studio <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-07-22/sony-s-naughty-dog-video-game-studio-finally-has-a-team-of-producers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hired a number of producers</a> specifically tasked with alleviating workload. However, many of those producers have reportedly since left the company, and some employees have apparently already worked long hours to finish Intergalactic's first trailer, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-heads-to-space-with-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-the-game-awards-2024">debuted at The Game Awards last year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Druckmann has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-naughty-dogs-most-expansive-and-maybe-the-most-expensive-game-the-studio-has-ever-made">referred to Intergalactic</a> as the most "ambitious" "expansive" and "expensive" game Naughty Dog has ever made. "What can I say and not say? I can tell you we’re in the thick of it. We’re making it, we’re playing it.

He continued, saying that "Larian's DNA is agency" and said it would be irresponsible of the studio not to "evaluate new technologies," presumably referring to the generative AI discussion that started the controversy. But he also appeared to backpedal somewhat on the idea, adding that "our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke's full statement is below:</p><blockquote>It’s been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation. <p>Larian’s DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, and players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make.</p><p>In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes.</p><p>To give you more insight, we’ll do an AMA featuring our different departments after the holiday break, in which you’ll get the opportunity to ask us any questions you have about Divinity and our dev process directly.</p><p>We’ll announce the date in the new year. In the meantime, I wish you all happy holidays!</p></blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke's statement comes in response to criticism of his own remarks in interviews following the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yup-that-weird-statue-was-teasing-a-new-divinity-game-the-game-awards-2025">announcement of a new Divinity last week</a>.

Some examples given included using the technology for brainstorming, PowerPoint presentations, pitching concept art, and writing placeholder text.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, a number of players across various social platforms, as well as game developers and even former Larian employees criticized the studio, arguing that the listed uses for generative AI at Larian either seemed like things that didn't benefit from generative AI at all (such as placeholder text), or alternatively were key parts of the artistic process and would suffer from not having humans at the helm throughout (concept art).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke then responded with multiple statements, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">one given to us</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another posted on Twitter/X</a>, where he claimed that critics were misunderstanding what Larian was doing and that "We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also had our own interview with Vincke about Divinity, which you <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/if-you-like-baldurs-gate-3-this-is-gonna-be-great-larian-boss-swen-vincke-reveals-what-to-expect-from-divinity-in-first-interview-since-the-game-awards-announcement">can read in full here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
