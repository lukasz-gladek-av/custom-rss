            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-everything-announced-for-title-update-1<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom hosted a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> Showcase today, spotlighting everything coming to its latest entry in the Monster Hunter series. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-has-a-release-date-and-loads-more-details-title-update-2-set-for-summer-2025">Alongside a look at Title Update 1</a>, we also got news about more cosmetic DLC, some surprise additions, and the next Title Update on the way too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Title Update 1 arrives on April 4, 2025, as a free update for all owners of Monster Hunter Wilds. In tandem with the launch, several pieces of free and paid DLC will be going live as well. A new hub will expand the hang-out potential for hunters, new armor and cosmetic pieces shake up the fashion game, and more fearsome monsters await on the horizon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've now got a date, details, and more for the next big update in Monster Hunter Wilds. What part of the update are you most looking forward to? Let us know down below!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">A New Hub For Hunters</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-14-1742912741311.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The showcase started with a look at the new endgame hub for hunting parties. Dubbed the Grand Hub, there are plenty of new things to do in the area. Feast together, arm wrestle, or listen to the Diva sing at night. There's also a Barrel Bowling mini-game, which you can obtain vouchers for through various activities, and more rewards to be earned through it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Grand Hub can be unlocked once you're Hunter Rank 16 by talking to Tetsuzan in Suja, the Peaks of Accord.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mizutsune Arrives</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-15-1742912686820.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As confirmed, the big addition for Title Update 1 is the bubbly monster Mizutsune. It's got swift tail strikes, water jets, and many other moves ready to burst your bubble when it arrives in Title Update 1. Once you've reached HR 21 or above, head to the Scarlet Forest and talk to Kanya for the quest. And of course, there's some new gear to make from the hunt.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Additional Hunts on the Way</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A new Event Quest will bring Arch-tempered Rey Dau to Monster Hunter Wilds. Arch-tempered is a scale above the usual Tempered fight, making this a potentially challenging bout. You'll have to be HR 50 or above to challenge it, and new armor awaits those who can clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zoh Shia is also getting its own fight. Previously, you'd only fight Zoh Shia once, as part of the main story. With the new update, you'll be able to re-fight Zoh Shia through new quests after reaching HR 50, and craft new armor from it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arena Quests</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Speedrunners get their own challenge to tackle in Arena Quests, which will allow hunters to compete for the fastest clear times. Both Challenge Quests and Free Challenge Quests will be available, with pendants given out for participation and achievement alike. You can access them through the counter in the new Grand Hub.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Change Alma's Outfit</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the hardest-working handlers around is finally getting some cosmetic options. You'll be able to change Alma's attire through an appearance menu in camp, and one new outfit is being given out for free. After completing a certain side mission, you can also change out Alma's glasses.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-21-1742913507424.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">More DLC is on the way</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A mix of free and paid DLC is arriving in tandem with Title Update 1. Some additions, like some classic gestures from Monster Hunters prior, will be made freely available for hunters in the store. Others, like those in the Cosmetic DLC Pack 1, are available through the store, or for those who picked up the Cosmetic DLC Pass or Premium Deluxe Edition. New stickers, looks for Alma, and even more are on the way.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-23-1742912586790.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">More Event Quests and Seasonal Events</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even more Event Quests are on the way, alongside Seasonal Events. The latter are special windows of time where the Grand Hub will change appearance, and available meals will also change. LImited equipment, gestures, decorations, and more are available during these Seasonal Events.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Seasonal Events kick off with the Festival of Accord: Blossomdance on April 23, adding pink cherry blossoms and some new decor to the game. Capcom confirmed that most previously available events and Event Quests should return in the future, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Roadmap Ahead</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-24-1742912549128.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's how Title Update 1 and its related content will roll out over the coming months. Title Update 1 arrives on April 3 for U.S. players, with the Blossomdance starting on April 22. On April 29, the challenging new Arch-tempered Rey Dau arrives, and by end of May, some other features and a Capcom collaboration will debut.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-26-1742912521189.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To end the show, we also got a tease of the upcoming Title Update 2, due to arrive this summer. No firm date has been announced just yet, but we did get a brief image that teases the possible return of a long-awaited monster: Lagiacrus, the underwater leviathan, who looks to be causing some chaos on the surface.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest in Capcom's long-running monster-fighting series <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-surpasses-8-million-units-sold-in-3-days-and-is-the-fastest-capcom-game-to-do-so">brought in some big numbers with its launch</a>, and with Title Update 1, the company will be setting the cadence for how it moves forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help get your Monster Hunter Wilds adventure started, take a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Things_Monster_Hunter_Wilds_Doesn%27t_Tell_You_-_Tips">what Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t tell you</a>, and a guide to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Weapons">all 14 weapon types</a> in the game. We’ve also got a detailed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Walkthrough">MH Wilds walkthrough</a> in progress, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Multiplayer_Guide_-_Crossplay,_Link_Parties_and_More">MH Wilds multiplayer</a> guide to explain how to play with friends, and if you’ve played one of the open betas, here’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/How_to_Transfer_Beta_Character_Creator_Data">how to transfer your MH Wilds Beta character</a> over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Also from the OG days, the 50v50 LTM returns as OG 50v50.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">OG 50v50 pits two 50-player teams against each other, and runs until 9am ET on April 14. Fortnite veterans will remember that 50v50 was the first-ever LTM to be added to Fortnite Battle Royale, all the way back in 2017.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The meteor will emerge in the sky later in OG Chapter 1 Season 3, and get closer and closer as the Season goes on. This, too, will be fondly remembered by Fortnite players who were there to see battle royale kick off back in the day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, starting today, March 25, anyone can create their own The Walking Dead Universe islands for Fortnite using Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) and Fortnite Creative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creators can start a new project using one of the new The Walking Dead Universe templates to access unique Walking Dead-themed weapons, Prefabs, Galleries, and Walker NPCs. Then, on May 16, developers will be able to publish their The Walking Dead Universe islands via the Creator Portal and make them available for people to play.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/fortnite-x-the-walking-dead-universe-shiva-shotgun-and-lucille-1742910536643.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Negan's infamous baseball bat, Lucille, hits Fortnite. Image credit: Epic Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Kirkman, creator of The Walking Dead, said: “This collaboration with Fortnite is an incredible opportunity to expand The Walking Dead in ways we’ve never imagined. Whether it’s Lucille smashing through hordes or the eerie presence of Walkers, I can’t wait to see where the Fortnite community’s creativity takes us.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Here’s a breakdown of some of the Walking Dead tools available for Fortnite creators today:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Walker NPC</strong> - Slow, unintelligent, horde enemies, Walkers are motivated by their primal drive to consume humans.</li><li><strong>Weapons and Items</strong> - Mow ‘em down with the Shiva Shotgun Ranged Weapon, an exotic, modded pump shotgun (which also triggers a Shiva tiger roar); use the Lucille Melee Weapon, the iconic heavy-hitting baseball bat wrapped in wire wielded by the infamous Negan (and perfect for bashing in Walkers and Survivors alike).</li><li><strong>Effects</strong> - Create with the new heavy linework post-processing effect, a shader that influences the overall look and feel of an island to bring the tone and visual style of The Walking Dead comics.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
