            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> is set to go up against Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 later this year, and while both are military first-person shooters, it sounds like there will be at least one significant point of difference: skins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty‚Äôs foray into goofy skins territory is not a new phenomena, although recent releases have certainly amped up the conversation around them. With the likes of Beavis and Butt-Head and American Dad hitting the game this year shortly after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-dutys-ongoing-420-obsession-sparks-debate-among-fans-some-have-had-enough-others-really-want-that-seth-rogen-skin">weed-obsessed bundles starring Seth Rogen</a>, some fans have said they‚Äôve had enough of what they call the 'Fortnite-ification' of their beloved Call of Duty, and have pleaded with publisher Activision to return to its mil-sim roots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter Battlefield 6, a game EA is pitching as having a ‚Äúgritty realism‚Äù aesthetic. But will this extend to skins? In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/battlefield-6-dev-responds-to-fears-of-unrealistic-beevis-and-butthead-skins-we-listen/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VideoGamer</a>, UX director Alan Pimm said he was unaware of any internal plans to release crossover skins that would break the aesthetic Battlefield 6 is going for, and promised the developers were listening to fan feedback.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWhat I can tell you is I don‚Äôt know of any plans and, at the moment, that package is the ‚Äògritty realism‚Äô and that we listen. That I can tell you,‚Äù he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, we must also bear in mind that there is enormous pressure on Battlefield 6 to do the business for EA. Indeed the company has said it‚Äôs all in on the game, which it sees as a platform just as Activision does with Call of Duty. It would be naive to expect EA to resist the temptation to release eye-catching skins, and even crossover with other IP for bundles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is, how far will it go? Will EA, when all is said and do, stick with Battlefield 6‚Äôs ‚Äúgritty realism‚Äù when it comes to skins, as Call of Duty initially set out to? Or will it buckle and end up going down the same path with 90s cartoon skins of its own?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/01/f2dyabzwaaa5-ec-1754039802526.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nicki Minaj hit Call of Duty in 2023.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a separate interview with DBLTAP, Battlefield 6 design director Shashank Uchil doubled down on EA's committment to grounded realism, and even pointed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-call-of-duty-season-5-snoop-dogg">Call of Duty's infamous Nicki Minaj skin</a> as something Battlefield 6 doesn't need.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúIt has to be grounded," he said.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo‚Äôs first financial report since the launch of Switch 2 is in, and it‚Äôs smiles all round for the company after record-breaking sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch 2 has sold more than 6 million units globally in the seven weeks since launch, breaking a number of sales records for video game consoles. Nintendo said demand for Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and it apologizes to consumers. ‚ÄúWe will continue to strengthen our production and supply systems to deliver as much Nintendo Switch 2 hardware as possible,‚Äù the company said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs a fantastic result for the Switch 2 hardware itself, which is comfortably the fastest-selling in Nintendo history. Nintendo said demand ‚Äúhas surpassed our expectations.‚Äù Still, it‚Äôs sticking to its forecast of selling 15 million Switch 2 units in the financial year ending March 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for games, Nintendo said Switch 2 software sales reached 8.67 million units. Launch title Mario Kart World made up the bulk of those game sales, shifting 5.63 million units (almost as many as the Switch 2 itself has sold). But it‚Äôs worth noting that figure includes units bundled with the hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end result is that overall sales totaled 572.3 billion yen (approx. $3.8 billion), and operating profit grew 4% to 56.9 billion yen ($378 million) for the three months ending June 30. After all the furore over Trump‚Äôs tariffs and changing product prices, in its financial report Nintendo said ‚Äúat this time there is no significant impact on our earnings forecast for this fiscal year.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, demand for the OG Switch has remained even after the launch of the Switch, and sales of the console inched ever higher, and are now at 153.1 million. The number of annual playing users between July 2024 and June 2025 has remained above 100 million, which means Nintendo launched Switch 2 into an environment where a huge number of people were already playing Switch.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Upcoming Switch 2 exclusives include Drag x Drive, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, Kirby Air Riders, and FromSoftware's The Duskbloods. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is due out on the OG Switch and the Switch 2 later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-everything-announced">Nintendo held a Direct showcase</a> focusing on upcoming games from third-party developers and publishers, including Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection, Octopath Traveler 0, and The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Stanislav Kogiku/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
