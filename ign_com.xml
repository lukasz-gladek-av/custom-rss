            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-preorder-restock-latest-amazon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most exciting trading card crossovers in years is nearly here. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy releases on June 13</a>. The upcoming set has been steadily building in hype since its announcement, and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/final-fantasy-x-magic-the-gathering-official-trailer"><u>new trailer</u></a> has since kicked the excitement up an extra notch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to get your hands on the set, you're in luck. There's a lot <em>out of stock</em> right now, but several of the elusive Final Fantasy MTG sets are now back in stock at Amazon, Walmart, and TCG Player, including the <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxJv3?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Play Booster Box</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the market price of that booster set has also surged this month. Only a few weeks ago you could pick it up for<a href="https://zdcs.link/akKXAr?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> <u>$164.99 from TCGPlayer</u></a>; it's now just over $179. Amazon had also restocked at $189.99 again (sold and shipped directly), up from the original listing's $144.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also the<a href="https://zdcs.link/av4LB7?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> <u>nine-booster Final Fantasy bundle (plus bonus cards)</u></a> for $89.92, despite still being available to preorder for <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w7pj?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$70 at Walmart</a>, alongside<a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwAZB?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> <u>single sealed boosters</u></a> that have risen from $7.99 to $9.19 as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what is "Market Price"? Those collecting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pokémon TCG</a> will be wildly familiar with the concept, but it's where retailers will take liberties with the "recommended" part of an MSRP, and list it for what they think folk will pay. Capitalism at its finest, I know, and for Final Fantasy MTG, "Market Price" is currently around $20-40 over MSRP, depending on what you're buying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you can stomach the cost, with the rest of the sets sold out and some singles already going for over $500, you'll want to lock in your preorders before everything vanishes faster than you can say Chocobo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prices in the singles market are looking remarkably high as well, with the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWY5y6?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">borderless version of Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</a>, currently sitting at $147.23, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2Oy5?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Surge Foil version</a> is at an almighty $599, the most expensive of the entire FF set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've already preordered, or are just on the hunt for rare singles, there are a few other clear standouts to keep an eye on in the coming weeks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes the gorgeous <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ7nB?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">borderless Kefka, Court Mage card</a>, shown off in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/final-fantasy-x-magic-the-gathering-official-yoshitaka-amano-teaser"><u>new MTG teaser trailer</u></a> from PAX East, and featuring longtime Final Fantasy artist, Yoshitaka Amano.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAgWvw?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCG Player</a> is good spot for a wide collection of single cards you can purchase and add to your deck without having to hope for a good pull. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also a good resource for figuring out how much your cards are worth once the new set is out, so if you pull any Surge Foil cards in your booster pack preorders, you might suddenly find yourself with quite the nest egg. But, it's also worth noting that prices change all the time, so some cards may change in value closer to release. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other highlights to look out for when opening boosters, or to consider buying standalone, include the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OYxn?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cloud, Ex-Soldier Commander card,</a> which costs $45.99 at the time of writing. That’s not surprising, given how easy it makes it for equipping other creatures you might have in play on the field. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there's also the full-art version of the <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xD8y?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Yuffie Kisaragi - Yuriko, the Tiger's Shadow</a>, currently just under $100. That’s due to both the card’s use as a Commander and its rarity, especially in that classic late 90’s FF7 art style. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s when you get to some of the special cards where things get extra expensive, though. Alongside that eye watering $599 Cloud card, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q47GKA?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">borderless version of the Traveling Chocobo card</a>, costs $169.98, while the <a href="https://zdcs.link/a03YE3?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">standard version</a> stands at a cheaper, but still expensive $114.97. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also buy the new Traveling Chocobo cards, which even had their own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/final-fantasy-x-magic-the-gathering-official-limited-gold-chocobo-teaser"><u>teaser trailer featuring a limited edition Gold Chocobo</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While it can be expensive when seeking out the rarest cards, quite a number of singles at TCG player can also be bought at a low price. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes the likes of <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YWwVm?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sazh’s Chocobo for $1.96</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgw0D?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tonberry for $2.49</a>, the useful <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXW7vm?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Summon: Shiva for $1.56</a>, or even <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GXpP?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gladiolus Amicitia for 33 cents</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moreover, TCG Player is also hosting preorders for select Final Fantasy booster sets, albeit at over MSRP, but at current market price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, for those just preordering the Starter Kit today, it is also worth noting that each deck in the set is preconstructed, and doesn't feature boosters to open (so no surprise $600 cards).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Set First Looks</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, it includes one traditional foil legendary creature, five brand-new non-foil cards debuting in Magic, and 54 cards from the main set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The kit also comes with four non-foil double-sided tokens, two <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-arena">MTG Arena</a> code cards (one per deck), and two deck boxes. That’s a lot of value packed into a $20 price tag.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For new Magic: The Gathering players, the Arena code cards are especially useful. You can redeem both decks to play online, giving you a chance to learn the game at your own pace through AI matches or competitive play.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More MTG Preorders and Restocks</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-may-13-2025"><strong>Looking for more?</strong></a> There's also plenty of other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-full-release-schedule-2025">Magic: The Gathering products to buy now or preorder</a>, such as the highly anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-preorder-guide">Edge of Eternities</a> set. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-mtg-sealed-booster-box-in-stock-at-amazon">Spider-Man is also back in stock at the moment</a>, with a few sets still up for grabs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Senior Commerce Editor, for IGN.

But, according to former live producer of BF2, Mats Holm, that is unlikely to be the case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't expect Battlefront 3 to be announced at the end of this rally," Holm wrote, referring to the recent uptick in Battlefield 2 player numbers. "But overall, yeah, I think there are people who are talking about it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Holm, the biggest issue holding up a new game is that the majority of the Battlefront 2 team are no longer at DICE.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We spread all over," Holm revealed. "A few went to Ubisoft, some went independent, some to King, Avalanche, Star Stables, Paradox, Starbreeze, Mojang to name a few. Some left Stockholm to join game companies abroad as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Embark has a lot of the people who made base game, but the people who made the live game did not leave in a pack. We all slowly drifted after being put on Battlefield."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Andor Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked whether DICE could still make a new Battlefront game without its previous team members, Holm admitted he was "sceptical." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The live team ended up approaching the game very differently than the original devs," Holm wrote, referring to how the team who continued making Battlefront 2 content post-launch turned around the game's fortunes following a shaky start. "If they went about it the same way as before, they will not get how we brought the game back from the abyss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So, if their goal was 'let's learn everything from their work,' perhaps. If they are 'new game, Battlefield but in Star Wars outfits' it won't turn out well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of now, only "about three people" are left from Battlefront 2's live team at DICE, the developer continued. There's also the issue that, for now <a href="https://in.ign.com/untitled-battlefield-game/230398/news/battlefield-6-electronic-arts-reveals-new-details-for-the-upcoming-game-including-playtest-expansion" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DICE is busy throwing all of its development weight into getting its big new Battlefield game</a> finished.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, in a perfect universe, the developer said they would like to see the franchise continue — although they wouldn't make Battlefield 3 next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hear me out — no Battlefront 3 right now, but Battlefront 2 Remaster for whatever future console is arriving in 2027-28," the developer suggested. "Dev time is around 2-3 years. There is a laundry list of improvements that this game could get in my opinion, and getting it updated was always on our wishlist.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Once that is a success, then start work on 3. You have a team familiar with engine, assets and really could kick off developing a 3 within a much shorter time span, and working on feedback from a fresh Battlefront 2 audience base. This would be a 5-6 year plan, but it's far more likely to be a success."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Improvements for Battlefront 2 would include cross-play, day/night cycles and dynamic weather for all planets, a 1-vs-1 mode and more, the developer concluded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"List is endless, but [these options] were off the table as we were in live, not [original game] production," the developer concluded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

A Song of Ice and Fire writer George R. R. Martin, who wrote Game of Thrones and helped create <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring"><u>Elden Ring</u></a>'s world, is attached as a producer on the movie, as is Vince Gerardis.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Sigh why? No one ask[ed] for this keep FromSoftware away from hollyweird plz," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1ktetgx/comment/mtsyb14/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>complained</u></a> one player, while another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt4piv/comment/mtqs5g5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>: "I was hoping it was just a meme. This movie is going to be a pretty looking mess."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are worried about the storyline, given so much of Elden Ring's lore is implied and has chiefly been interpreted by the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is the the main problem with adapting any of the Fromsoft Souls games into movies, almost all the lore is interpreted by the fan base, very rarely will the games tell you very directly about anything, a movie can't be like that since it'll try to appeal to the majority of people, so things will be spelled out in great detail, ignoring one of the main attractions of these type of games," one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt4piv/comment/mtqvfva/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt4piv/comment/mtqt548/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Another</u></a> suggested that while that may be the case if a story was based upon the Tarnished, "a movie around the lore or NPCs?

Even putting aside his game-writing credentials (he wrote Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and DmC: Devil May Cry), in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jucgre/comment/mm14377/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a Reddit AMA</u></a> last month, Garland revealed he was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt9iot/director_and_writer_of_a24s_elden_ring_adaption/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>currently on an NG+6 run of Shadow of the Erdtree</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Have you seen [Garland's] films?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1ktd6ni/comment/mtsq30b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>asked this player</u></a>. "They're excellent movies but they're a bit weird and so they cause mixed opinions. They're very 'artistic' in the sense that a lot of people bounce off them for being 'weird'. This, in my opinion, is exactly the guy you want involved in an Elden Ring movie because he can handle weird."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Garland makes amazing stuff and I was gonna say this is an out-there director choice, but he did make Ex Machina which is all sorts if f***ed up," this player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt4piv/comment/mtqqujq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>. "Could be epic."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Say what you will about the idea of an Elden Ring movie, but at the very least we’re in the best hands possible with Garland," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt9iot/comment/mts3c9e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented</u></a> this impressed player. "Go watch his video with [Last of Us creator] Neil Druckmann if you need any convincing that he will be as true as possible to the source material."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, plot, casting details, and a release date for the Elden Ring movie have yet to be announced, and fans are also speculating on that, too, including a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt9q51/so_is_jack_black_gonna_play_godrick_or_what/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>cheeky recommendation</u></a> for Jack Black to play Godrick — or Torrent; I've seen suggestions for both — and another for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt7rv6/now_that_the_movies_been_confirmed_i_hope/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Chris Pratt as a Tarnished</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of the movie world, Elden Ring has continued to attract gaming fans with more content in the years since its release.
