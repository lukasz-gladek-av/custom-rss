            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">1.6 million units were sold during its launch month in the U.S., and 82% of buyers also got Mario Kart World.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> debuted in June to become the fastest-selling hardware ever in the U.S., shooting spending on games to new monthly records, according to the monthly report from Circana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spending on hardware was up a whopping 249% year-over-year thanks to the console's debut, reaching $978 million and greatly surpassing the previous monthly record from June 2008 of $608 million. In total, the Switch 2 sold 1.6 million units in the U.S. during its launch month, beating the PlayStation 4's previous sales record of 1.1 million units in November of 2013. Unshockingly, it was the best-selling console of the month both in terms of units and dollar sales.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Across both Nintendo Switch platforms, Switch 2-exclusive Mario Kart World was unshockingly the best-selling game of the month, followed by Cyberpunk 2077 and Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, both of which launched alongside the new console. In fourth and fifth place respectively were Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild, followed by Street Fighter 6, Mario Kart 8, Hogwarts Legacy, Bravely Default's remaster, and Minecraft. Because Nintendo doesn't share digital sales numbers with Circana, this chart may be missing some big sellers. For instance, we learned today that <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/deltarune-topped-switch-2-digital-charts-in-june-while-mario-kart-world-dominated-in-active-players/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deltarune topped Switch 2 charts in digital sales in June</a>, but with no physical edition and the game only costing $25, it's missing from the dollar sales ranking entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So does all this Nintendo Switch 2 success mean it's on track to outsell the Nintendo Switch 1? I asked Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, and this is what he told me:</p><blockquote>What the launch sales of Switch 2 primarily tell us is that they made a lot of Switch 2 to sell at launch. Lifetime sales and launch sales of a console often do not correlate, meaning that some consoles with small launches ended up doing incredibly well lifetime (PS2 only sold 400k in its launch month) while others with big launches ended up not doing as well lifetime. Since launch month demand is rarely satiated by available supply (and it is certainly not a great sign when it is, historically) all we can really get a read on at launch is the confidence of the manufacturer to make so many units available, and the ability of the supply chain to get those units into the market.</blockquote><blockquote>But having the biggest launch month sales for any new video game hardware platform is a helluva good start.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Across all platforms, Elden Ring: Nightreign was the best-selling game of the month for the second month in a row, followed by debut titles Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Mario Kart World. Those numbers don't include Nintendo digital sales of Mario Kart World, and they also don't include physical hardware bundles, meaning Mario Kart World will likely have performed significantly better than is indicated here. Per analysis by Circana's Mat Piscatella, 82% of Nintendo Switch 2 buyers in June purchased Mario Kart World either via a standalone sale, or as part of a bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma debuted at No.10. Stellar Blade ranked No.5 on the overall charts and was the second best-selling game on PlayStation thanks to its debut on the platform last month. And while Final Fantasy XVI didn't crack the overall top 20, it was the fourth best-selling game on Xbox, also thanks to its release on the platform in June. Overall, content spending in June was up 6% year-over-year, largely driven by Switch 2 game sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Accessories spending also set a new June record of $293 million, in no small part due to sales of the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. It was the best-selling accessory of the month and has a 32% attach rate with Nintendo Switch 2 hardware.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">June 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Elden Ring: Nightreign</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach (NEW)</li><li>Mario Kart World (NEW)*</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Stellar Blade</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>MLB: The Show 25*</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Grant Theft Auto V</li><li>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</li><li>Split Fiction</li><li>EA Sports FC 25</li><li>Elden Ring</li><li>NBA 2K25</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered</li><li>Star Wars: Battlefront II (2017)</li><li>Cyberpunk 2077*</li><li>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</li><li>WWE 2K25</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tolkien’s Middle-earth has captured the imagination of fantasy fans worldwide ever since The Hobbit was published in 1937. And although Peter Jackson is the film director who successfully brought the books to life on the big screen, you might be surprised to learn Middle-earth also has a rich video game history that goes back decades. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The earliest video game adaptation was created in 1982 by Beam Software, which developed a text-adventure game based on The Hobbit. The game was a huge hit and went on to sell over 500,000 units in Europe, despite middling reviews from critics. Such is the power of Tolkien’s works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In total, there are over 50 video games based on the works of J.R.R. Tolkien that span numerous genres, like action-adventure, RPG, strategy, and more. As we prepare for another new Tolkien game just on the horizon, we’ve gone through this long history and chosen the 11 best Lord of the Rings games ever made.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Lord of the Rings Video Games</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">11. The Lord of the Rings: War in the North</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The legal rights to adapt The Lord of the Rings into video games are almost as complicated as Middle-earth’s lore itself. In the early 2000s, Tolkien’s literary works and Peter Jackson’s film adaptations were treated separately, with Vivendi and Tolkien Enterprises owning the rights to adapt the books for games, while EA owned the rights to adapt Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings movies. In 2009, Warner Bros. was able to bring together both movie and book rights and, at long last, develop games that incorporated story elements from both the literary and cinematic worlds of Tolkien.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/25/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north-review">The Lord of the Rings: War in the North</a> is the first Middle-earth game to feature story and design elements from both books and films. This hack-and-slash RPG stars a trio of original characters: The Ranger Eradan, the Dwarf Farin, and the Elf Andriel, each with their unique playstyle. The trio goes on a journey parallel to the events of the film trilogy after they’re enlisted by Aragorn to help the Fellowship, all while Frodo makes his way to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. While the combat is generally considered enjoyable, albeit typical of its time, the real draw is that Lord of the Rings fans get to role-play as self-insert friends of Aragorn during the iconic events of the Peter Jackson movies.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. The Lord of the Rings Online</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since 2007, thousands of players have ventured into the many regions of Middle-earth itself thanks to the extensive digital world of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/12/the-lord-of-the-rings-online-shadows-of-angmar-review">The Lord of the Rings Online</a>. While certainly not as popular as other MMORPGs like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy 14, Lord of the Rings Online has cultivated a dedicated player base thanks to the way it brings the world of Tolkien to life, allowing players to explore the far corners of Eriador, Rhovanion, Gondor, and Mordor. A visit to The Lord of the Rings: Online can even be considered essential for any Lord of the Rings fan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Create a unique character and travel around Middle-earth during the events of The War of the Ring and undertake quests and raids crafted after events from the novels. What’s more, the game is still going strong after 18 years, with the most recent expansion, Legacy of Morgoth, released in late 2024. It also remains the only Lord of the Rings MMORPG, and will remain so for the foreseeable, especially after Amazon canceled its own planned Lord of the Rings MMORPG in 2021.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Lego The Hobbit</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">TT Games, formerly Traveller’s Tales, has transformed beloved franchises into wildly popular, comedic adventure Lego games for years. Lego The Hobbit follows the same formula that made the studio’s Star Wars and Harry Potter games such beloved hits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A zany re-telling of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/10/lego-the-hobbit-review">Peter Jackson’s Hobbit movies</a> built of plastic bricks, players can adventure through the events of the trilogy’s first two films, An Unexpected Journey and The Desolation of Smaug (the third film, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, had not yet hit theaters.) You can unlock and play as dozens of different Hobbit movie characters in this humorous adventure, which splices plenty of great skits and sight gags into an otherwise pretty faithful (if heavily condensed) recreation of the movies. Expect to battle goblins, ride barrels, and steal from a colossal dragon. But as enjoyable as this all is, just know there is a better Tolkien movie trilogy with a better Lego adaptation slightly further down this list.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA Los Angeles launched a series of real-time strategy games based on Middle-earth in 2004, during the height of the genre’s popularity. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/12/04/the-lord-of-the-rings-battle-for-middle-earth">The Battle for Middle-earth</a> is rooted in the tried-and-tested Command &amp; Conquer formula: you take command of either the forces of Gondor or Mordor, establish a base by building unique structures and units, and then send out an army that will fight a war to determine the fate of Middle-earth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle for Middle-Earth was a critical and commercial success when it was released,  thanks to its satisfying single-player story mode that included separate, complete campaigns for both Gondor and Mordor. Many praised the way it perfectly translated the world of Middle-earth to the RTS genre, and EA LA would go on to one-up their achievements with a far superior sequel that you’ll also find in this list.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lord of the Rings is the kind of property that allows for all kinds of adaptations. RTS? Sure! MMORPG? Absolutely. How about a Final Fantasy-esque turn-based RPG? Surprisingly, also yes –  you’ve found your way to The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Criticized for being maybe <em>too</em> inspired by Final Fantasy 10, right down to having a similar battle menu, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/11/02/lord-of-the-rings-the-third-age-3">The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age</a> nevertheless combines a familiar, turn-based combat system and class-based party system with the world of The Lord of the Rings.  The result is a satisfying RPG that has become an enduring fan-favorite. The Third Age, like War in the North, is set parallel to the events of the Peter Jackson films, with players taking on the role of characters who are hot on the trail of the Fellowship. Along the way, you visit many of the same locations that appear in the film trilogy, and battle familiar foes like the Balrog. There are even moments where you can temporarily team up with members of the Fellowship itself in battle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not the most original game on this list, but  The Third Age is a great way to feel like a part of The Lord of the Rings movies without simply playing as Aragorn, Gandalf, or Frodo.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth 2</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA LA followed up their Tolkien RTS with a superior sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/03/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii-review">The Battle for Middle-earth 2</a>. Like the first game, you can choose between a Good or Evil single-player campaign. The former’s story is centered on the Elf Glorfindel, who allies himself with the Dwarves to defend Rivendell from Sauron. Meanwhile, in the Evil campaign, Sauron sends his commander, the Mouth of Sauron, and the Nazguls to invade the North.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to the first game, players raise armies consisting of infantry, bowmen, pikemen, cavalry, and siege machines and command them using characters from The Lord of the Rings. The sequel also adds even more factions, including Goblins, Dwarves, and Elves, for a total of six factions. It’s the better game of the two Battle for Middle-earths by far, but sadly, neither is available to buy today thanks to EA losing the Lord of the Rings licence, and even owners of the old physical editions cannot battle online as online servers were shuttered in 2010.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Lego The Lord of the Rings</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the Hobbit game we’ve previously spoken about, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/26/lego-the-lord-of-the-rings-review">Lego The Lord of the Rings</a> is TT’s brickified adaptation of the original trilogy of movies directed by Peter Jackson. And if you’re only going to play one of them, this is the one you <em>want</em> to play. You can play as any of the 80+ available characters in Lego form, from Frodo and Aragorn to Lurtz and Tom Bombadil, all while running, jumping, and building your way through the events of the superior Tolkien film trilogy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lego games usually live or die depending on which popular franchise they're adapting, and TT had a great foundation in the vast, varied world of The Lord of the Rings. There’s something particularly charming about seeing Middle-earth brought to life in Lego form, which makes it  easy to recommend to any fan. Do you like The Lord of the Rings? Do you like Legos? Do you like fun platformers? Boom, one of the best Lord of the Rings games ever.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back during the era of official movie tie-ins in the early 2000s, , EA published a couple of hack-and-slash games based on The Lord of the Rings films where you took control of members of the Fellowship and made your way through the key events, leaving a pile of orc corpses in your wake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Gauntlet-like gameplay suited the fantasy swords-and-sorcery battles of The Lord of the Rings well, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/04/lord-of-the-rings-return-of-the-king-review">The Return of the King</a> was especially notable for its inclusion of local co-op, allowing you to form your own mini-Fellowship and go through the adventure together. Using actual scenes from the Peter Jackson movie to serve as cutscenes (a benefit unlocked thanks to the PS2’s DVD drive) and gameplay that captured the scale of the films’ battles, Return of the King was head and shoulders above many official tie-in games released at this time. But it didn’t quite beat its own predecessor… </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/10/21/lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers-2">The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</a> and The Return of the King are very similar games built on the same hack-and-slash foundations, and so your favorite of the two is largely up to personal preference. Which scene from the movies do you most want to experience? For our money, the Helm’s Deep level in The Two Towers is among the very best moments in any Lord of the Rings video game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, you’ll find many of The Two Towers’ key moments re-created here (as well as a few from The Fellowship of the Ring, too.) But the real joy is found in taking control of  one of the members of the Fellowship themselves. Whether it’s the hack-and-slash sword combat of Aragorn, the speedy ranged bow attacks of Legolas, or the heavy axe swings of Gimli, The Two Towers’ combo-heavy combat felt as good as any action game released in the early 2000s. Throw in amazing visuals taken straight from the movies, and The Two Towers is a standard-bearer for official movie tie-in games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Middle-earth: Shadow of War</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously mentioned, complications around the rights to The Lord of the Rings have led to a variety of restrictions. The Middle-earth: Shadow games, though, were developed during a time when Warner Bros. had the rights to both Tolkien’s works and Peter Jackson’s movies, which meant developer Monolith Productions was able to take inspiration from the wider universe detailed in the <em>legendarium</em>, the lore bible that The Lord of the Rings is built on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/05/middle-earth-shadow-of-war-review">Shadow of War</a>, the second game in the series, goes to some unusual places because of that freedom. It involves figures like Shelob (here depicted as a woman, rather than a spider, because of lore reasons) and the never-before-seen Entwives, and ties protagonist Talion’s fate directly into the story of the Ringwraiths. Shadow of War’s overly complicated story, with its convoluted attempts to tie its world to the movies, is the reason why many have the sequel ranked below its predecessor when it comes to Monolith’s two Middle-earth games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But story isn’t everything. Shadow of War features a much larger, more varied world than its scorched brown predecessor, allowing you to explore more of Middle-earth. The same fantastic combat and, of course, the Nemesis system, all return from the first game, but they’re bolstered by a fortress siege system that captures the epic scale of iconic battles such as Helm’s Deep (albeit you’re fighting alongside an amassed army of brainwashed orcs, rather than men and elves.) All this helps skyrocket Shadow of War towards the top of our rankings, beaten only by its fantastic predecessor.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Set between the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/26/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a> sees the Gondorian Ranger Talion bond with the wraith of Celebrimbor, the elf who unwittingly aided Sauron forge the Rings of Power. Together, they go on a journey through the depths of Mordor to get revenge on Sauron’s generals who murdered Talion’s family. With fewer ties to the movies than in the sequel, Shadow of War, Shadow of Mordor tells a more cohesive story of revenge in Middle-earth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the true star of Shadow of Mordor is Monolith’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-warner-bros-shut-down-shadow-of-mordor-developer-monolith-and-canceled-wonder-woman-fans-lament-the-wasted-potential-of-its-nemesis-system">patented Nemesis system</a>. Every Orc in Shadow of Mordor is unique to your playthrough, each given a random design, traits, and name. But beyond just procedurally generating an army of unique foes for you to kill, the Nemesis System shifts and changes each Uruk’s relationship with both you and their peers depending on how you interact with them. If one kills you in combat, for example, they will get promoted for their valiant deed and will bring up their victory the next time you encounter them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This system, combined with the satisfying, Batman Arkham-style combat and a story that isn’t just a retread of Peter Jackson’s movies, easily makes Shadow of Mordor our favorite Lord of the Rings game of all time. Sadly, Monolith Productions was shut down in 2025, and so we’ll likely never see another Shadow game, nor the Nemesis System again. And so the two Middle-earth games serve as a proud legacy for this departed studio.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With a new line of The Lord of the Rings movies on their way, as well as the ongoing Rings of Power TV show on Prime Video, there will likely be even more Tolkien games coming in the future. Next up is the cozy game Tales of the Shire from Fictions and Weta Workshop, which will deliver an entirely different video game take on Tolkien’s world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-11-best-lord-of-the-rings-video-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve played over 120 hours of Super Mario Party Jamboree since I reviewed it on Nintendo Switch last October. I loved it from the jump – giving it a 9 in my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review"><u>original review</u></a> – and it’s continued to be a top choice on game nights with family and friends. So I was thrilled when Nintendo revealed that this would be one of the first Switch 1 games to get a Switch 2 expansion, thinking an upgraded version with great mouse control minigames and interesting new ways to party would be a total slam dunk. Unfortunately, Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV is just as sloppy as its overly wordy title, with a handful of problems stemming from the frustrating decision to completely separate its new and old content. The fantastic base game is still hidden underneath a pile of annoying choices, but it’s tough to recommend the Switch 2 Edition as the clear, definitive version of the best Mario Party there’s ever been. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before I get into the major differences between Jamboree on Switch 1 and Switch 2, I highly recommend you <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review"><u>check out my original review from last year</u></a> if you’re looking for in-depth thoughts on the base game, because it all holds true. Super Mario Party Jamboree itself is still an amazing time, with fantastic boards and items that emphasize strategy more than ever before, a great selection of minigames that features returning classics and new favorites, and a gorgeous presentation and attention to detail that elevate the whole package. I’ve been playing Mario Party pretty much my entire life, and now that I’ve had it for almost a year, I can definitively say that Jamboree is my favorite entry in the series. If you don’t own it at all, I can’t recommend the Switch 1 version enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, with that all said, that doesn’t mean the Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV is worth the upgrade. This new version is essentially an <em>entirely unaltered port</em> of the Switch 1 release with the Jamboree TV expansion glued on. When you first boot it up, the menu will look familiar to anyone who’s played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review"><u>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury</u></a>: You select between Super Mario Party Jamboree (complete with a Switch 1 icon in the top left, indicating this is just the old game and nothing more, not even a resolution bump) and Jamboree TV, which displays a Switch 2 icon and actually makes use of the new tech. The difference between this and 3D World’s expanded version, however, is that 3D World and Bowser’s Fury are wholly unique games that make sense to separate, while these two share a majority of their content but differ in strange, limiting ways. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Mouse, Camera, Action!</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Jamboree TV is where all of the new minigames and modes that take advantage of the Switch 2’s hardware live. The clear highlight is the set of 14 new minigames that use the Joy-Con 2’s mouse controls. Switch 2’s mouse controls may not be comfortable for extended periods of time, but they work super well in the context of a 45-second Mario Party minigame, and I was surprised by how much I loved the entire lineup. Highlights include Stuffie Stacker, where you work with a partner to build the tallest tower possible out of blocks and Yoshi plushies, and the chaotic Goomba Scoopas, where you drive a snow plow to frantically shove piles of Goombas into your team’s gate. Playing with mouse controls means everyone has to use a single Switch 2 Joy-Con instead of a pair or a Pro Controller, but with the improved, larger design over the original Joy-Con, it feels like less of a concession and more of a legitimate option this time. Every mouse minigame is 2v2, which adds a ton of variety to the lineup of team games that appear in Mario Party mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of which, Jamboree TV adds two great rulesets to try out alongside the original that put fun spins on the classic dice-rolling action. The first is Tag-Team Rules, which pits two teams of two against each other. Every player still takes their own turn, but each pair shares the same pool of stars, coins, and items, so you need to work together on every decision to come out on top. It’s a fun way to shake up the traditional format and it builds even further upon the strategic foundation of the base game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Jamboree TV's clear highlight is the new minigames that use mouse controls.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I also love the new Frenzy Rules as a fast-paced way to fit a whole game of Mario Party in without it taking upwards of 90 minutes. Frenzy games only last five turns – or roughly 30 minutes – and each player starts out with 50 coins, a Double Dice, and even a star. Every roll and minigame feels crucial when you only have five turns to set yourself apart from the pack, and this is an exciting mode I never knew I wanted. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, it’s a shame Jamboree TV doesn’t add any new boards to the mix, instead focusing on side modes that are pretty forgettable. Carnival Coaster is a cooperative mode where you use mouse controls in an on-rails shooter, completing team minigames as you go to add more time to the clock. I play Mario Party to compete, not cooperate, and it starts to feel repetitive after just a couple of runs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Bowser Live uses the Switch 2’s built-in microphone and optional camera in an attempt to put <em>you </em>into the game. You enter Bowser’s lair and pop out of a warp pipe and – if you have a camera plugged in – see a live image of yourself. You then compete in completely controller-free minigames where you stack Goombas on your head or just literally scream into the microphone as loud as you can to score points.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Party Jamboree Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve known since the days of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/04/03/wario-ware-snapped-review"><u>WarioWare: Snapped!</u></a> that minigames control better with an actual controller than with a camera or microphone, and Bowser Live doesn’t do anything to change that truth. A microphone minigame where you clap to the beat, for example, is so much less precise than the Donkey Konga minigame where you do the same thing but with actual buttons. As a result, the appeal wears off after just a couple of minutes, and at my most cynical, it feels like a tacked-on mode designed to sell Switch 2 cameras and nothing more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jamboree TV in general makes use of the Switch 2’s ability to use a camera, as live feeds of you and your friends’ faces are visible throughout the party – although you don’t need a camera to access these modes and can play everything but Bowser Live without missing out on any content. I guess it’s a nice novelty and kids might like seeing themselves or their parents on the TV, but it’s not something I ever see myself using outside of testing it for this review.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>A Tale of Two Parties</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though some of the new content is worthwhile, things get really frustrating when you consider <em>how </em>Jamboree and Jamboree TV split up their content. As I mentioned, the Jamboree side of the fence is a straight port of the Switch 1 game, which means there’s no mouse control minigames, camera functionality, or option to do the Frenzy and Tag-Team Rules. That wouldn’t be a problem if the Jamboree TV side of things was an outright replacement and included everything Jamboree has to offer, but it’s inexplicably missing a ton of content from the Switch 1 side.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jamboree TV completely lacks Pro Rules, which was one of Jamboree’s best additions. It reduces luck and focuses on strategy, and I praised it in my original review. Here, it’s <em>only </em>available on the Switch 1 side, and so are all of Jamboree’s original side modes – that’s Koopathlon, Bowser Kaboom Squad, Paratroopa Flight School, Toad’s Item Factory, Rhythm Kitchen, the single-player campaign Party Planning Trek, and every mode in Minigame Bay besides Free Play. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan Ranks Every Mario Party</h3><p>I reviewed Super Mario Party Jamboree, and it's my new favorite in the series. Here's my ranking of all 18 games -- that's a lot of parties.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">More importantly, Jamboree TV lacks all of Jamboree’s achievements, customization, and unlockables. In the Switch 1 version, you have to earn Party Points to buy additional stickers and finish achievements to unlock three of the boards, but Jamboree TV just gives you everything right from the start, taking away the fun sense of progression and incentive to play single-player that I really valued. It also means if you’re buying this new on Switch 2, you’ll have everything unlocked in Jamboree TV, but nothing unlocked in Jamboree, which is just odd. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s stranger is that these two sides don’t talk to each other whatsoever: If you’re playing Jamboree TV and do something that would normally earn you an achievement over in Jamboree, nothing happens and the Switch 1 version doesn’t recognize it at all when you return there until you do it again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another example is minigame records. My group and I love to chase high scores in minigames – whether in Free Play or during a Mario Party game itself – but Jamboree TV doesn’t track records <em>at all. </em>Did you get a new crazy high score on the button-mashing Domination? Switch 1 Jamboree will congratulate you with the iconic “New Record!” sound effect and display that score until someone else beats it, while Switch 2’s Jamboree TV won’t track it anywhere.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>More than half of this is an unchanged Switch 1 game with zero performance updates. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even worse, the Switch 1 side didn’t receive <em>any </em>performance or resolution updates to take advantage of the new hardware. Jamboree TV runs in 1440p docked, but Jamboree is 1080p docked and still a noticeable <em>720p </em>handheld, which was the maximum resolution of the Switch 1 screen. Nintendo is charging $80 for the Switch 2 Edition at launch, when more than half of it is quite literally an unchanged Switch 1 game. And while it’s only $20 for the upgrade if you already own it, I’m still not sure that’s worth the compromised way this expansion works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you want to play Pro Rules with the enhanced resolution? It’s simply not possible. How about include the mouse control minigames while still working toward achievements? You can’t do that, either. It also takes so long to swap between the two versions that you’re better off just closing the software altogether and rebooting: the staff credits roll <em>every time </em>you leave TV, but at least they’re skippable. One of my favorite things about Jamboree is how many choices it gives you to make your Mario Party experience exactly what you want it to be, but Jamboree + Jamboree TV has entirely lost that graceful design just nine months later unless you only stick to the unaltered base game, which defeats the entire purpose of upgrading. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review]]></content:encoded>
