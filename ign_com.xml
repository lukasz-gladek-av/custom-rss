            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Just in case you weren't sure what to make of all those <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag"><u>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</u></a> remake/remasters rumors, Ubisoft reportedly "threatened to sue" the voice of protagonist Edward Kenway for previously hinting that fans would get the chance to beat the game again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Multiple reports charting the game's development have surfaced over the past couple of years, with <a href="https://in.ign.com/assassins-creed-black-flag/188218/news/ubisoft-is-reportedly-working-on-an-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Skull and Bones studio Ubisoft Singapore</u></a> reporting working on something <a href="https://in.ign.com/assassins-creed-black-flag/222720/news/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-rumors-hint-at-new-in-game-systems-engine-it-will-be-built-on-an" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ultimately more substantial than a simple remaster</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Ubisoft itself has yet to confirm the project and declined to comment on the matter last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-swirl-as-collectible-maker-admits-there-is-something-going-on"><u>when an Assassin's Creed merchandise maker dropped an obvious Black Flag remake hint</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This latest rumor, however, came directly from leading man Matt Ryan himself. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-star-just-gave-fans-their-biggest-hint-at-a-remake-yet"><u>the actor behind the game's hero, Edward Kenway, offered up some teasing words</u></a> at a convention. Asking a fan if they'd completed Black Flag, he teased: "Well, you might have to beat it again‚Ä¶" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the fan replied, "Is this true? I have to run through all of them again," Ryan responded with a knowing wink, saying, "Well, especially this one. There's a reason I say that, but I can't say anything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story doesn't end there, though. Meeting fans at a different convention ‚Äî and despite the fact the Black Flag remake feels like an open secret ‚Äî Ryan would only respond to further questions on the subject with: "I don't know, mate," (thanks, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-star-just-gave-fans-their-biggest-hint-at-a-remake-yet">PC Gamer</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When pressed further, Ryan said: "Well, the thing is, when that happened, someone was doing this‚Äî" (at this point Ryan pointed to the person holding up their phone to record the interaction) "‚Äî I was being very free and open, but I didn't know that they actually were recording me on their phone. And then the company threatened to sue me. Yeah, so I say nothing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Ubisoft for comment.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Damn so it seems like Matt Ryan (voice actor for Edward Kenway) got into deep trouble with Ubisoft for hinting at the Black Flag Remake to that other guy..</p><p>He didn‚Äôt realize he was being recordedüòµ <a href="https://t.co/2Vy8g6pMRr" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2Vy8g6pMRr</a></p></div>‚Äî The Hidden One (@TheHiddenOneAC) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">While Ryan is likely aware of the ongoing speculation around a Black Flag remaster, could his involvement in it extend beyond seeing his prior work re-released? Reports have suggested Ubisoft is working on a substantial re-working of Black Flag ‚Äî does that mean Ryan himself is involved, re-recordling dialogue, or contributing to new story elements?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With no all-new Assassin's Creed game set for the end of this year, fans believe the Black Flag remake would be well positioned to arrive in time for the holidays. Here's hoping Ryan isn't made to walk the plank for dropping this latest hint, and it's not too long before Ubisoft makes the remake official.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
