Tears of the Kingdom is the only Nintendo Switch game released by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-black-friday-sale-2024">Nintendo</a> to retail for $69.99, and soon at <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qbn7WJ?object_uuid=859e3d11-fa8f-48f6-a799-694898694ee9&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$30</a>, this will be the lowest we've seen the game yet. If you're a <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5bV5d?object_uuid=859e3d11-fa8f-48f6-a799-694898694ee9&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart+</a> member, there's a 5-hour early access that starts <strong>12 PM ET on Monday, November 25. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If it doesn't sell out within that time, it'll be live at 5 PM ET for everyone else. As a backup, Target has the game down to <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMvek6?object_uuid=859e3d11-fa8f-48f6-a799-694898694ee9&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$39.99 right now as well</a>, which, while it isn't as good, is still a tremendous offer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see the Tears of the Kingdom listing at Walmart below, and even add to your cart ready to buy tomorrow. We'll endeavor to update you when the deal is live, and if retailers like Best Buy and Target price match the offer as well.</p><div catalogid="d43fd930-1c94-4160-a6ed-07908b619be2" id="211474"><div id="211474" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Should You Sign Up for Walmart+ Before Nov. 25?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While one of the standout deals in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-walmart-early-black-friday-deals-2024">Walmart’s first wave of Black Friday offers</a> is a 50% discount on a 12-month Walmart+ membership, it's still probably not worth signing up just to snag a single deal. You’d likely be better off purchasing the game at Target for $40. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, consider whether early access to Walmart’s upcoming deals or the other benefits of a 12-month membership makes sense for you. Take some time to weigh the value of the subscription against your shopping habits to decide if it’s the right choice.</p></div><div catalogid="ffb2807f-13c0-4d38-a85c-dc765656ace1" id="210375"><div id="210375" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Walmart+ 12-Month Membership</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Can't Wait? Tears of the Kingdom is $39.99 at Target Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like we said, if you can't wait, or as a backup, Tears of the Kingdom is $39.99 at Target for Black Friday from today onwards. It's is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-games-2">best games on Nintendo Switch</a>, and the sequel to Breath of the Wild brings new areas to explore in the clouds and depths below the surface, offering what feels like a brand-new take on Hyrule. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It begins one year after Breath of the Wild. One day, while exploring under Hyrule Castle, Princess Zelda and Link discover a mummy that comes alive, shattering the Master Sword and wounding Link. When he awakens, Link finds himself on the Great Sky Island, one of the many floating islands in the sky. Here, the many mysteries of the ancient Zonai tribe are revealed.</p></div><div catalogid="ddb149a2-d46b-4935-838f-af1cd363d65f" id="211385"><div id="211385" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">What We Said in Our Review</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">our 10/10 review</a>, we said Tears of the Kingdom "is an unfathomable follow-up to one of the greatest games ever made, somehow improving upon it in nearly every way – be that with simple quality-of-life improvements, a genuinely exciting story, or wildly creative new building mechanics that make you rethink what is possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It both revamps old ground and introduces vast new areas so immense it somehow makes me wonder if Breath of the Wild was actually all that big, with an almost alarming number of tasks to complete, mysteries to discover, and delightful distractions to keep you from ever reaching that place you naively thought you were headed. Nintendo has followed up a triumph with a triumph, expanding and evolving a world that already felt full beyond expectation and raising the bar ever higher into the clouds."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Black Friday Game Deals We've Found So Far</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual date of<strong> </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024"><strong>Black Friday</strong></a><strong> in 2024 falls on November 29</strong>, but the holiday deals season starts a lot earlier than that. Plenty of retailers have already been dropping deals online. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More and more deals will roll out leading up to the event, which culminates in massive discounts on Black Friday. Retailers will not reveal their biggest Black Friday deals until the big day, but most general deals will be available well in advance, such as the impressive Sonic deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

If that sounds appealing, I've got some good news, it's also on sale for Black Friday. Now down to <a href="https://zdcs.link/ak7nL5?object_uuid=94f2ccfd-8926-4265-a823-a2239a31d63a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$39.99 at Amazon</a> (the previous best deal was $49.99 last week), that's $30 off the game, only released back in August this year.</p><div catalogid="8185a1a9-1142-402d-98e2-339a3b88657f" id="208147"><div id="208147" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws (PS5)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1sXCR6GmB3Kn7OrKiy8DPO/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-140" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> detailed the patch notes and confirmed the removal of forced stealth—meaning players will no longer have to return to a checkpoint when triggering "do not raise the alarm" or "do not get caught" objectives—alongside improvements to enemy AI and detection, facial expressions and animations, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This Title Update brings changes to combat and stealth allowing for greater player choice, the ability to now keep pick-up weapons in more situations, visual options to allow for a sharper image and much more to improve your journey across the galaxy," Ubisoft said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars Outlaws creative director Drew Rechner promised to make big changes to "elevate the game experience to better meet" player expectations. Sentiments such as these are often seen in the wake of disastrous game launches but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws debuted to positive reviews</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed">Poor sales shook a struggling Ubisoft</a>, however, and it is now working to improve the game ahead of what it hopes will be a sales bump, hopefully thanks to the $40 Black Friday deal, alongside <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-unveils-roadmap-leading-up-to-november-steam-release">its Steam launch</a> and the holiday period.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What We Said In Our Review</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review">IGN reviewer Tristan Ogilvie said is his review</a>: "It’s ironic that Kay’s ship is called the Trailblazer, since there’s actually not a whole lot of ideas in Star Wars Outlaws that haven’t been done before in other action and open-world adventures."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Instead, it’s quite like the Millenium Falcon: a bucket of bolts held together with repurposed parts and prone to breaking down, but at its best it’s more than capable of jolting your pleasure centres into Star Wars fan hyperspace."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A clever syndicate system brings real weight to almost every task you choose to undertake, some of which have creative quest designs that can often conjure up some genuinely stunning blindsides. Having a pal like Nix at your side the entire time not only adds an extra dimension to Kay’s fairly generic smuggler character, but also gives her an enhanced set of useful abilities."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Black Friday Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual date of<strong> </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024"><strong>Black Friday</strong></a><strong> in 2024 falls on November 29</strong>, but the holiday deals season starts a lot earlier than that.

As a mercenary caught in the middle, it’s up to you to outfit your mech with the perfect loadout and dive into missions that require brains, brawn, and a little button-mashing finesse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Armored Core VI, it’s not just about blowing things up (though there’s plenty of that). The customization options let you create a mech that reflects your playstyle, whether precision strikes from afar or close-quarters carnage. Add a visually stunning world and epic boss battles, and you’ve got a recipe for hours of adrenaline-fueled fun. Let's not forget Armoured Core being pretty much a Soulsborne franchise but with mechs, so get good!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve been itching to join the mech party, now’s your chance. At $19.99 you’re not just saving $40, you’re scoring a ticket to one of the most exciting games in the genre. Don’t wait too long, though.

The story is nice and twisty, pitting you and your fellow futuristic military men against the alien Tyranid forces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’re done with the campaign, there’s a whole lot of cosmetic gear and armor colors you can collect by playing co-op missions or online multiplayer matches. The whole game is just a great shooter that delivers on the fundamentals. Plus, it looks fantastic, having left behind the previous generation of consoles. You can read my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 review</a> for more details to see whether it’ll appeal to you. I loved it, though, giving it an 8 out of 10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the summary: “Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a terrific third-person shooter with a compelling story, loads of weapons that are a blast to use, and a healthy variety of enemies to use them on. It once again borrows many of its ideas from the Gears of War series, but they’re good ideas, and Space Marine 2 does a fine job of making them its own. And while the Operations PvE mode that accompanies it doesn’t currently offer enough to keep me coming back, the deep customization options for your Space Marine do look promising if it’s supported in post-launch updates as planned. Besides, when you’re eviscerating aliens on planets as pretty as these, it’s hard not to leave satisfied. “</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Black Friday Game Deals We've Found So Far</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">For more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday discounts</a>, check out our roundups of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024">PS5 deals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-black-friday-2024">Xbox deals</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-black-friday-sale-2024">Nintendo Switch deals</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

The inclusion of a full year of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-nintendo-switch-online-cost">NSO membership</a> is also a notable upgrade from past bundles, which typically featured just three months of Nintendo Switch Online.</p></div><p id="game-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Game deals">Switch Black Friday Game Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Phase two of Nintendo’s Black Friday sale is now live, offering plenty of great deals across popular Switch titles.

Instead, consider whether early access to Walmart’s upcoming deals or the other benefits of a 12-month membership make sense for you.
