            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Percy Jackson: Siege of Monsters will allow players to relive major moments from the novels and second season of the Disney+ series. </h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Percy Jackson is coming to Fortnite. The popular series, based on the novels by Rick Riordan and now streaming on Disney+, was just announced to be getting its very own Fortnite Island on December 9. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Revealed on stage at CCXP25 in Brazil, Percy Jackson: Siege of Monsters will allow players to “embark on an authentic Percy Jackson adventure across an island map inspired by Camp Half-Blood – the earthly sanctuary and training facility for the children of mortals and Greek gods. As newly arrived demigods, players must discover the identity of their godly parent, gain new divine powers, and ally with their fellow demigods for a climactic battle against Scylla and Charybdis on the Sea of Monsters.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players will be able to meet various characters from the popular stories, rendered in the likenesses of the actors from the streaming series, including Percy Jackson, Annabeth Chase, and Grover Underwood, and “complete multiple side quests” and other activities “inspired by the first two seasons of the show.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/06/islandthumbnailimage-percyjackson-landscape-1920x1080-v1-legaltext-1765035026327.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I recently spoke with the stars and producers of the show about bringing some fan-favorite storylines to Fortnite. Walker Scobell, who plays Percy on the series, and co-star Aryan Simhadri (Grover) had been begging producers to get their characters into Fortnite “since day one.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm just excited to be the guy from Fortnite,” says Scobell. “That's what I want people to call me. If that's the only thing I'm ever remembered for, I'm fine with that. Percy Jackson? No, he's the guy from Fortnite.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Series Executive Producer and Co-showrunner Dan Shotz, who presented a sneak peak of the Fortnite island at CCXP, says bringing Percy Jackson to the game involved a lot of moving pieces. “We have worked directly with Disney to build an entire world within Fortnite,” Shotz says. “You're going to get to see incredible monsters. You get to fight the Minotaur, you get to have a boss battle with Scylla and Charybdis, and you also just get to hang out with the gang from Percy Jackson. It's pretty epic.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Percy Jackson: Siege of Monsters</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dior Goodjohn, who plays Clarisse on the show, agrees: “It's really, really sick. You kind of know the magnitude of what you're doing when they put you in a video game or when you get a doll made of you. This is insane that this is real life for all of us right now. It's crazy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Percy Jackson Creator Rick Riordan says it was important to adapt his stories for a younger, modern audience. “I cannot tell you how many years the fans have been asking me, ‘When are we going to get a Percy Jackson immersive game?’” Riordan says. “I (played) my share of World of Warcraft when I was younger, (so) I get it. I totally get it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leah Sava Jeffries, who portrays Annabeth, says she used to play Fortnite but intends to jump back in now that she and her co-stars are featured in the game. “This is making me want to go back and play it again,” Jeffries says. “I have been waiting for this for so long, and now I really feel like this is our moment.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 2 of Percy Jackson and the Olympians hits Disney+ December 10. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Michael Peyton is the Senior Editorial Director of Events &amp; Entertainment at IGN, leading entertainment content and coverage of tentpole events including IGN Live, San Diego Comic Con, gamescom, and IGN Fan Fest.
