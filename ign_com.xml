            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/some-overwatch-fans-are-thrilled-loot-boxes-are-coming-back-some-not-so-much<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard Entertainment laid out the roadmap for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>'s coming months yesterday, confirming a massive overhaul of the hero shooter. There was a lot to dig into, from perks and the incoming Stadium mode to plenty of cosmetics, but one notable piece of Overwatch history also returned: loot boxes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reveals-radical-overhaul-of-overwatch-2-including-return-of-loot-boxes-perks-and-third-person-mode">Loot boxes are returning to Overwatch 2 with Season 15</a>, and it's spurred some interesting discussion around whether that's a good thing or not. For those unfamiliar, these boxes are drops you can accrue over time, which will randomly spit out an Overwatch cosmetic at random once you open them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Loot boxes were a core part of Overwatch 1's original monetization model and methods for doling out cosmetics, especially for those who would rather spend time than money. They had seasonal variants, great animations, and were a way to build up a modest portfolio of skins, poses, and highlight intros even if you weren't spending extra cash on Overwatch.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Overwatch 2 Season 15 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, loot boxes have also been a historic point of contention in the industry. Reports called them <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lootboxes-manipulative-exploitative-new-report">manipulative and exploitative</a>, and some players found them ‚Äî alongside similar microtransactons like gacha ‚Äî <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-how-loot-box-addiction-destroys-lives">addictive</a>. As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/genshin-impact-developer-agrees-to-20m-fine-over-loot-box-violations">recently as last month</a>, these forms of microtransactions were eliciting fines. Overwatch itself <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-battle-pass-store">ditched the model years ago</a>, shifting to a free-to-play, battle pass-driven model.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To those points, it's not surprising that the return of Overwatch's loot boxes will look a bit different from its previous iteration. For one, loot boxes are a free offering; Blizzard confirmed to IGN that you can acquire loot boxes through free means, like the battle pass' free track or weekly rewards, but you won't be able to buy them directly. Secondly, there are some relatively helpful mechanics for getting boxes and finding what you want. Game director Aaron Keller <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRoM9B6vmhw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed in an interview with Overwatch content creator Emongg</a> that duplicate drops can be re-rolled, and other venues for boxes (like Discord and Twitch promos) will be available. Plus, it sounds like the team is dipping into past Overwatch cosmetics for box fodder, even adding things that aren't available in the current shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So with all that laid out, how is the Overwatch community responding to the return of loot boxes? Well, that's a little complicated. A celebratory post on the Overwatch X/Twitter account, below, has a mix of enthusiasm and jabs in the replies.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>LOOT BOXES. ARE. BACK. üôåüéÅ</p><p>Available in both the Battle Pass and weekly rewards, see what surprises are waiting for you when Loot Boxes make their official return in Season 15 üéâ <a href="https://t.co/BGZmIlii5d" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/BGZmIlii5d</a></p></div>‚Äî Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1889741290394227102?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Some streamers <a href="https://x.com/BroYouWack/status/1889766365575131588" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showed genuine excitement</a> at the return of loot boxes, and if you head over to the Overwatch subreddit, you'll also <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1inyadh/ladies_and_gentlemen_loot_boxes_are_back/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find some threads</a> where players are happy to see loot boxes back. The sentiment is largely carried by this being a free option for progression. Plus, in my opinion, nostalgia is a factor. The animations and tangible tension, hoping for a legendary drop, all rekindles some of Overwatch 1's original vibes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there are criticisms of loot box's return. With all the aforementioned fines and stories around microtransactions, the tone around loot boxes has shifted quite a bit since Overwatch launched in 2016. And though these boxes are free to stack up over time, there are <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1inywdx/overwatch_2_is_bringing_loot_boxes_back_from_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plenty outside Overwatch-affiliated spaces</a> who are sceptical about their return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I do think this highlights another interesting critique. Overwatch bringing back loot boxes, combined with ongoing 6v6 experiments, the new Perk mechanics, incoming Stadium mode, and more all paint a picture of a studio trying to drastically overhaul its game. The fact that loot boxes seem to be resonating most with the Overwatch fans, both current players and those who have moved onto other games, lends some credence to it. Bringing back loot boxes as a free offering and doling out past cosmetics through it feels like a strong play for nostalgia, a return to an older, "classic" form of Overwatch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing's for sure: Blizzard certainly seems like it's trying to pick up momentum in 2025. Alongside the heroes, cosmetics, and maps you'd expect from a live-service shooter, Perks seem set to dramatically shift the play space, and Stadium could go even further. We'll see how all that, loot boxes included, pans out for Overwatch 2 when Season 15 goes live on February 18.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is joined by a PlayStation 5 Pro patch, which allows the best resolution while running at 60 frames per second.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Detailed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/13/astro-bot-five-new-levels-and-special-bots-begin-rolling-out-today/?sf276380355=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a> post, Tick-Tock Shock is the first level available now. Subsequent stages ‚Äî Thrust or Bust, Cock-A-Doodle-Doom, Hard to Bear, and Armored Hardcore ‚Äî will be available each following Thursday at 6am Pacific / 9am Eastern / 2pm UK.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Unlike our last update Winter Wonder, which was a walk through the Xmas park, this new update features harder levels to test your jumping skills," said director of developer Team Asobi, Nicolas Doucet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Each level comes with a brand new Special Bot to rescue and, once that‚Äôs done, can be replayed in Time Attack mode with online rankings."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the third full wave of Astro Bot downloadable content, which began with a similarly structured five speedrun levels after launch and, until this release today, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-reveals-free-expansion-coming-to-astro-bot-this-week">most recently saw a special Christmas themed level released</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have long expected more DLC, however, as a number of unreleased bots appeared in the Astro Bots credits. Featured here are licensing credits for Rayman, Worms, Assassin's Creed, Beyond Good &amp; Evil, Croc, and Tomba, potentially revealing which five special bots will be released alongside these levels. That being said, Armored Hardcore is almost certainly a reference to Armored Core, while Cock-A-Doodle-Doom is likely Doom, so bots from these franchises are also likely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-exclusive-astro-bot-sells-15-million-in-2-months">Astro Bot has proved incredibly popular for PlayStation, having sold 1.5 million units in its first two months</a> on sale and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">earned a 9/10 in IGN's review</a>. "A fantastically inventive platformer in its own right, Astro Bot is particularly special for anyone with a place in their heart for PlayStation," we said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
