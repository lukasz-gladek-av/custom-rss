Wonder — Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park</a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both games are set to debut in the coming months exclusively for Switch 2, and interestingly Nintendo has decided to promote them both in a dedicated Nintendo Treehouse: Live presentation that's set to last around 80 minutes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally released for the original Switch back in 2023, Super Mario Bros. Wonder sees Nintendo's usual sidescrolling formula mixed with some psychedelic additions. This new Switch 2 version gives the base game a graphical polish, and adds the multiplayer-focused Bellabel Park to the mix, with a range of cooperative and competitive minigames to be played with others via local wireless and online. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-spot-unannounced-character-in-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-trailer">Rosalina gets invited in as another playable character</a> — just in time for her big screen debut in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. Super Mario Bros. Wonder — Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park is currently slated to arrive on March 26.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Pokopia, meanwhile, is the promising life simulation spin-off that looks to mix Animal Crossing gameplay with a surprising amount of familiar Pokémon. You play as a Ditto, disguised as a human avatar, which allows you to learn and copy Pokémon abilities to tame a wild and rundown landscape and turn it into a cosy home for you and your fellow creatures. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-the-final-preview">recent impressions of the game were positive</a>, and we're keen to find out more — including what the deal is with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-pokopia-trailer-showcases-animal-crossing-style-gameplay-plus-a-mysterious-pale-pikachu-mossy-snorlax-and-professor-tangrowth">those intriguing new unique Pokémon, such as Mosslax</a>. Pokémon Pokopia is currently set to launch on March 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on both games, tune in to Nintendo Treehouse: Live tomorrow — and keep an eye on IGN where we'll have all of the new details for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Of which, a clear standout is Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yotei, which was released to high critical acclaim in October last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://zdcs.link/a56bpL?object_uuid=3ba717dc-f243-47b1-9b3d-019aa30f7aa3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">game is down to $49.99 in the sale</a>, which is a $20 saving, and its first major discount since release. </p><div id="235680"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235680" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ghost of Yotei</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, the deal is only on physical copies of Ghost of Yotei, so it'll require buyers to own a <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLpnXo?object_uuid=3ba717dc-f243-47b1-9b3d-019aa30f7aa3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5 with a compatible disc drive</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those looking to pick up the game can do so from PlayStation's dedicated online store, PlayStation Direct. The promotional sale is running until March 9, so there's a limited time left in which to secure the offer as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other notable games in the sale include <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoJ5ve?object_uuid=3ba717dc-f243-47b1-9b3d-019aa30f7aa3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9ZAdmM?object_uuid=3ba717dc-f243-47b1-9b3d-019aa30f7aa3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">God of War Ragnarok for $20</a>, alongside <a href="https://zdcs.link/aB81qB?object_uuid=3ba717dc-f243-47b1-9b3d-019aa30f7aa3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Death Stranding 2 for $50</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l8wex?object_uuid=3ba717dc-f243-47b1-9b3d-019aa30f7aa3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spider-Man 2 for $30</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqJ4bq?object_uuid=3ba717dc-f243-47b1-9b3d-019aa30f7aa3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Stellar Blade for $40</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We had high praise for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-review">Ghost of Yotei in our review</a>, awarding it an 8/10. Reviewer Michael Higham had this to say about the game: "A predictable but well-executed story takes you through Ghost of Yotei's gorgeous landscapes and satisfying, fluid action combat." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With a new protagonist in Atsu as a vigilante who does not care about honor in her quest for revenge, you get a stronger lead character and an expanded weapon-set that elevates the gameplay principles set by Tsushima." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Although the novelty has lost a bit of its sheen, the Kurosawa influence is still strong and used to great effect. So while it may not be transforming open world games, Ghost of Yotei is a great refinement of the samurai power fantasy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Sucker Punch has also recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-legends-announced-as-free-dlc-sony-state-of-play">announced Ghost of Yotei: Legends</a>, an upcoming free DLC for the studio's hit 2025 open-world action-adventure.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">PS5 Games On Sale This Week</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is IGN's Senior Commerce Editor and resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

"I know that Netflix and Take-Two are very anxious to see the movie come out because they want to have the release coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That latter sentence is particularly exciting, as it teases that publisher Take-Two is keen to see the film debut around the same time as a new BioShock game (or two). Exactly what is meant by "incarnations" remains to be seen, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When pressed for timescales, Lee cautiously said: "It's steadily on the path, but you know how it goes.

Prior to that, Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski was working on his own adaptation, though that ultimately came to nothing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September 2025, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-movie-is-definitely-based-on-the-first-game-as-script-work-continues-following-netflix-budget-cut"><u>producer Roy Lee confirmed the project is still in active development</u></a>, with director Francis Lawrence on board to direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a tricky adaptation, so there's lots of things to figure out and to get right," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-director-says-were-in-a-pretty-good-place-with-netflixs-tricky-movie-adaption"><u>Lawrence told IGN at the time</u></a>. "There's regime changes at Netflix, and so things stall out and get re-energized and stall out and get re-energized, and I think we're in a pretty good place, honestly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bioshock-next"><u>BioShock 4</u></a>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">That matches its excellent Black Friday discount as well.</h2></p><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation’s Direct store is holding <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-launches-a-brand-new-promotional-sale-on-ps5-games-accessories-and-more"><u>a huge sale on PS5 games</u></a>, accessories, and more, helping you fill out the gaps in your collection, and one of the big beneficiaries of this is Kratos himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">God of War’s latest mainline entry, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok"><u>God of War Ragnarok</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-launches-a-brand-new-promotional-sale-on-ps5-games-accessories-and-more"><u>has been discounted by a whopping 71% at PlayStation Direct</u></a>, dropping to just $19.99, while Best Buy is matching the price as well. </p><div id="235681"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235681" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>God of War Raganrok</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That's $50 in savings, and well worth picking up over playing via PlayStation Plus (at least in my opinion), especially if you want to take your sweet time with what is a genuine masterpiece.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game picks up after the events of the 2018 reboot of the series, which took Kratos from Greek mythology to his new life, where he’s raising his son, Atreus. After revelations about the place of both in the wider pantheon, Ragnarok is packed with unforgettable moments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In IGN's review, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">Simon Cardy awarded the game a 10/10</a>, calling it an “enthralling spectacle to behold”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Impeccable writing, pitch-perfect performances, knockout action – it’s a complete work of art from top to bottom. Reflecting its core themes, it's everything a sequel should be: respectful of its legendary lineage, but not afraid to take it to exciting new places.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Couldn’t have put it better myself, and now’s a great time to jump on board ahead of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-trilogy-remake"><u>the remake of the Ghost of Sparta’s earliest adventures,</u></a> which were recently confirmed to be in development (but are likely some ways off yet). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kratos isn’t alone, either. Other discounts include almost 30% off of 2025’s Ghost of Yotei, essentially marking its first sizeable discount, as well as deals on the likes of Helldivers 2, Stellar Blade, Spider-Man 2, and many more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are even controllers on sale, including the limited Death Stranding 2 pad - but you'll likely want to move fast for that one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.</p></div></section><div><h3 data-cy="title3"><svg data-cy="icon-logo" viewBox="0 0 76 24" title="IGN"><title>IGN Logo</title><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M5.38 7.65a7.85 7.85 0 0 1 2.26-2.26c.13-1.18.31-2.26.52-3.21a10.605 10.605 0 0 0-6 6c.95-.22 2.03-.39 3.21-.52M16.34 5.36v.02c.9.59 1.67 1.37 2.27 2.27 1.18.13 2.26.31 3.21.52a10.627 10.627 0 0 0-6.02-6.01c.22.95.4 2.02.54 3.2M7.64 18.62c-.9-.59-1.67-1.37-2.27-2.27h-.03c-1.19-.14-2.26-.32-3.19-.54 1.07 2.75 3.26 4.95 6.01 6.02-.22-.95-.39-2.03-.52-3.21M18.64 16.35h-.03c-.59.9-1.37 1.67-2.27 2.27v.03c-.14 1.17-.32 2.25-.54 3.19a10.59 10.59 0 0 0 6.03-6.03c-.94.22-2 .4-3.19.54M10.04 0h3.9c.85 1.85 1.2 4.59 1.3 5.52.04.22.06.43.06.63L12 9.11 8.7 6.15c0-.17.02-.35.05-.55.1-.95.43-3.75 1.29-5.61M8.7 17.83c0 .17.02.35.05.55.1.95.43 3.75 1.29 5.61h3.9c.85-1.84 1.2-4.59 1.3-5.52.04-.22.06-.43.06-.64L12 14.87l-3.3 2.96ZM6.16 8.68c-.17 0-.35.02-.55.05-.95.12-3.75.45-5.61 1.31v3.9c1.84.85 4.59 1.19 5.52 1.3.22.04.43.06.64.06L9.11 12 6.16 8.7ZM24 10.02c-1.86-.86-4.66-1.19-5.61-1.29-.2-.03-.38-.05-.55-.05l-2.96 3.3 2.96 3.3c.2 0 .41-.02.64-.06.93-.11 3.68-.45 5.52-1.3v-3.9Z"></path><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M42.83 13.9V10h10.45c1.06 0 1.93.86 1.93 1.92v4.63c0 2.38-1.91 4.36-4.33 4.36h-6.69c-4.96 0-8.97-4-8.97-8.94s4.04-8.95 8.98-8.95h10.36v4.11H44.2c-2.67 0-4.86 2.17-4.86 4.84s2.16 4.83 4.86 4.83h6.91v-2.91h-8.27ZM33.86 3h-4.07v16.02c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.15V3M74.37 3.01h-2.18v13.81s0 .08-.03.11a.29.29 0 0 1-.24.14c-.09 0-.16-.04-.25-.15L64.83 4.93a4.347 4.347 0 0 0-3.72-2.11h-.07c-2.39 0-4.32 1.93-4.32 4.32v11.88c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.17V7.14s.02-.09.04-.13a.29.29 0 0 1 .24-.14c.09 0 .18.03.24.14l6.88 12.07c.76 1.27 2.12 2.05 3.69 2.05h.07c2.39 0 4.32-1.93 4.32-4.32V4.92c0-1.05-.85-1.91-1.91-1.91"></path></svg>Recommends</h3></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-20-dollars-ps5-playstation-sale-better-than-black-friday]]></content:encoded>
