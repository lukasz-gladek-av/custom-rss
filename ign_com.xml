Here, players discovered that the various spiderwebs lead to one central web that contained a cryptic direction in its web design: "N" and a symbol for another telegraph pole. Heading north (as directed by "N") leads to another wooden pole which, once found, can be shot at to reveal yet another direction under its bark.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Red Dead Redemption 2 Screenshots Show Off Rockstar's Epic Open-World</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that brings us pretty much up to date, and up to a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T4J8LYqUi0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> published just yesterday which details where the mystery is at now. Currently, players are following one final cryptic telegraph pole message that depicts a final direction, and the symbol for a guitar. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where is this all leading? Players are not sure, but the sense is that there's definitely more to this mystery to solve. Players are now hurriedly searching the Fort Wallace location — which holds the nearest guitars to the mystery's most recent clue — and are mapping every other guitar found in the game, in case it sparks some new revelation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this secret having existed for so long, there's little chance that Rockstar itself is teasing anything big or new at the end. (Though, what a way to reveal single-player DLC this would be!) For Red Dead Redemption 2 fans, though, this is an exciting moment — something new to ponder at last in their beloved game, as the wait for news of a re-release or new content stretches on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
