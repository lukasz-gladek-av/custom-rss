            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-s-tier-rank-every-rockstar-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Which Rockstar game do you think is the greatest?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new GTA 6 trailer is here and, in case you missed it, we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2"><u>broke down all of the secrets and details</u></a> from it. Sadly, though, we’re going to have to wait until May 26, 2026, to actually play Lucia and Jason’s story. So, in the meantime, why don’t we think about all of the Rockstar games we’ve already enjoyed over the years and rank them for fun?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has developed and released over 30 games since its creation in 1998, and is responsible for famous series such as Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, and Manhunt. But which comes out on top? Just to clarify, you won’t see the likes of LA Noire or Max Payne 2 here, as we’ve strictly gone with Rockstar-developed games, rather than ones the studio has published. I’ve had a go at ranking them via one of our IGN Tier Lists, purely taking into account my personal enjoyment of each game over the years. Take a look at my tier list here:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/07/screenshot-2025-05-07-at-12-08-59-1746616161781.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Dead Redemption 2 is simply my favourite game of all time, so it was a pretty easy S-tier pick for me if I’m honest. It’s (perhaps unsurprisingly) joined its predecessor and GTA 5 in that category – both pioneers of the cinematic open world genre. I also have a particular soft spot for Max Payne 3 and its bullet time ballet, as well as GTA San Andreas (a game I played at a way too young age). Down at the bottom in the D-tier, we have the likes of Austin Powers: Oh, Behave! and Welcome to My Underground Lair!, a game that literally nobody in their right mind wants to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t agree with me? Think that Vice City is better than GTA 4? Well, why not have a go at ranking all of Rockstar’s games yourself in a tier list below, where you can compare your own S, A, B, C, and D tiers with the whole of the IGN community.</p><div id="every-rockstar-game-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3><h3>Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We may have only seen two trailers so far, but where do you think GTA 6 will end up ranking when all is said and done? Let us know in the comments, as well as why you’ve ranked the games in the order you’ve chosen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/with-gta-6-trailer-2-out-in-the-wild-the-fan-theories-are-coming-thick-and-fast-and-some-sound-pretty-plausible<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 Trailer 2 is packed full of details (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2">we spotted 89!</a>), but it has also sparked an explosion of fan theories as the community analyze each frame for clues on what to expect when the most anticipated game in the world eventually comes out in May 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA fans across social media, Discord, forums, reddit, and elsewhere are putting forward their speculation, with Trailer 2 the most up to date reference point they have.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with a fun reference to Red Dead Redemption 2 that has some, once again, theorizing that the worlds of GTA and Red Dead exist within the same universe. Eagle-eyed fans spotted that the presidents on the cash seen in a screenshot of the club in GTA 6 are the same as those from Red Dead Redemption 2’s cigarette cards (Thaddeus Waxman and Franklin Hardin).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting this is an incidental detail, and GTA and Red Dead existing in the same universe does not amount to much at the end of the day (although some are now suggesting Jason may be a descendant of Arthur Morgan, given the two look sort of alike). But it shows that there are connections between the two Rockstar IPs that may be strengthened further when GTA 6 comes out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now onto some juicy stuff. There is a brief moment in the trailer early on when Jason walks into his house, and the camera moves into what looks like an over the shoulder, third-person perspective. There is little sign of gameplay in Trailer 2, but fans are theorizing that this cutscene may seamlessly transition into the beginning of GTA 6, with players thrust into controlling Jason as he walks around his house.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If true, it may be the case that GTA 6 features two of these sections: one for Jason and one for Lucia, the game’s second playable protagonist. The theory here is that GTA 6 will feature a similar transition into gameplay moment for Lucia, helping the player get to grips with the dual protagonist gameplay ahead of the time-skip to when Lucia leaves prison.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on, fans are focusing their attention on an image transition on the recently updated official GTA 6 website, which sees the camera swing around from spotlighting Jason to spotlighting Lucia as they share an embrace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are wondering if this is a character select screen that might display when you load the game. The expectation is you’ll be able to swap between Jason and Lucia during gameplay, but perhaps GTA 6 gives you the chance to pick between the two upon getting back into the game, and if so, this could be what we’ll see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are all sorts of theories on the nature of Jason and Lucia’s relationship and where the story will take it. I’ve seen everything from speculation that Jason is an undercover cop to either Jason or Lucia or perhaps even both dying at the end of the story. Most seem convinced either Jason or Lucia betrays the other at some point, which would be criminal. Perhaps we’ll get to choose via an optional ending system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just a note on the Jason is a cop theory: Jason tells the prison security guard, when picking up Lucia, that he might have been there before. In what capacity? Later, an older cop says, “Us cops, we’ve got to protect each other,” before the trailer cuts to Jason shooting at a moving car.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This leads on to a theory that GTA 6 may feature a third playable character that Rockstar is keeping secret so it’s a surprise to fans, and that this older cop may be it. Could you shift perspective to a cop hunting down Jason and Lucia during the story?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, this is a brilliantly silly fan theory: previous GTA games are <em>films</em> in the world of GTA 6. Phil Cassidy, the arms dealer from Vice City and GTA 3, is at the heart of this theory. In those games he’s missing an arm, but there is a character seen on Jason’s TV during the GTA 6 trailer that looks a lot like Cassidy — except he has both arms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s happening here? If this is indeed Cassidy, then how does he have both arms? Could the GTA 6 Cassidy be Phil Cassidy’s son? Or his grandson?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adding to the confusion is GTA's seperated universes structure. The GTA series is divided into three distinct parallel universes, officially named by Rockstar North as the "2D Universe", "3D Universe," and the "HD Universe."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2D Universe includes the original top-down GTA games developed by DMA Design. The 3D Universe starts with GTA 3 and includes its prequels, such as Vice City. And the HD Universe starts with GTA 4 and includes GTA 5, GTA Online, and the upcoming GTA 6, with each game set in the same year it was released. Following this, GTA 6 will be set in 2026, aka the modern day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, while these are meant to be distinct parallel universes, there is a lot of crossover between them, with shared place names, characters, some lore, and more besides. But certainly no-one was expecting Phil Cassidy from Vice City to pop up in GTA 6, as it makes the 'distinct parallel universes' thing even trickier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, perhaps having GTA’s 3D Universe games as films in the ongoing HD Universe would help resolve these issues. We do see what looks like Phil Cassidy on Jason's TV, after all. Or, this Phil Cassidy has nothing more than a fun Easter egg Rockstar added to GTA 6 to spark exactly this kind of speculation. This is Rockstar, after all!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trailer 2 has also reinforced existing theories that GTA 6 will feature heists, and that there is a heavy influence from the Fast &amp; Furious movies. At one point we see a truck with a vault attached to it, similar to the Fast 5 scene that does pretty much the same thing.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Marvrassiczilla 🅰️🦖🦎🦍 (@Movie__Fans) <a href="https://twitter.com/Movie__Fans/status/1919772545617952866?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">More GTA 6 fan theories are popping up all the time as people dig into Trailer 2. Expect plenty more in the year we have to wait until GTA 6 comes out.</p><div id="every-rockstar-game-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3><h3>Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The former is paid content while the latter will be available to all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First up is Rite of the Nine, a "fresh take on dungeon diving for both seasoned dungeon crawlers and those stepping into the depths for the first time" that is already available to all players for no additional cost. While the dungeons themselves — Prophecy, Spire of the Watcher, and Ghosts of the Deep — will be familiar to some, even the most hardened Guardian can expect "unique twists" in which you'll reconnect with Orin and refreshed dungeon weapons.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, on July 15, we'll get the brand-new expansion, Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate, a "multiyear saga that will unfold across multiple expansions." A paid-for expansion, The Edge of Fate will reintroduce us to the Nine, powerful and mysterious beings who existed long before the Traveler, as two characters "step into the spotlight" — new ally Lodi and Warlock Vanguard, Ikora.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The expansion will take place on new destination Kepler, described as "inspired by the puzzle-solving and pathfinding challenges of Destiny 2’s dungeons and destination design which encourages deep exploration, mystery, and player-driven discovery." Expect new enemies, weapons, gear, and "destination-specific abilities."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, on July 15, "major core game innovations" will roll out, including revised armor and gear systems "to create richer opportunities for buildcrafting" and a new activity selection screen called the Portal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Players will be able to easily choose between Fireteam Ops, Pinnacle Ops, Crucible Ops, and the newly introduced Solo Ops," Bungie explained. "Fireteam Ops and Pinnacle Ops reinforce quick fireteam action and longer-form cooperative content, while the new Solo Ops activities are specifically designed for solo players who want short, self-contained gameplay sessions without the need for a fireteam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Additionally, players can tailor activities to match their desired gameplay and the specific rewards they are chasing. 50 all-new modifiers will allow deeper gameplay customization and offer greater challenges for players, while curated activity rotations will ensure there is always something new to chase."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As typically happens with a new expansion, pre-order sweeteners are available, including an instantly unlockable Exotic Ghost and Legendary Emblem.

But it was not as well received as the studio’s previous games in the Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises, and the Shattered Space expansion, released a year later in September 2024, has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite reaching 15 million players, some wondered whether Bethesda might walk away from Starfield to focus on its other franchises. Bethesda itself has said it has "exciting things" planned for Starfield this year, amid growing discontent from players about a lack of communication and updates. In June 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2"><u>Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supporting Starfield</u></a>, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would release following Shattered Space. In an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-logo-pops-up-on-work-in-progress-starfield-creation-sparking-ps5-release-speculation">speculation that <u>Starfield</u> would soon be confirmed for release on PlayStation 5</a> ramped up after fans spotted a PlayStation logo on Bethesda’s official Creations website. The logo was attached to a work-in-progress ship decals Creation for Starfield, and although the Creation was removed, fans were left wondering whether Bethesda’s so-far PC and Xbox-only sci-fi game would soon make the jump to PS5.</p><div id="ranking-the-best-starfield-companions-and-crew" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ranking the Best Starfield Companions and Crew</h3><h3>Ranking the Best Starfield Companions and Crew</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While it’s easy to forget about Starfield given all the attention on Oblivion Remastered, its players are hoping that Microsoft and Bethesda go big on Starfield at its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-xbox-games-showcase-2025-for-june-plus-the-outer-worlds-2-direct">Xbox Games Showcase broadcast</a> on June 8.

Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade made some improvements to the PS4 version’s graphics and lighting, and also included Remake’s Intermission DLC, which centers on plucky ninja Yuffie’s arrival in Midgar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade is currently available on PS5 and PC. However, Hamaguchi revealed that with the Switch 2’s improvements over its predecessor, it will be possible to bring the game to Nintendo's handheld platform. “With the power of the Switch 2, we can now recreate Midgar with full specs,” he stated.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Being able to play this game on the Switch 2 in handheld mode means you can play it on the train while commuting to work,” Hamaguchi added, saying that the portability will also make it easier for people to directly discuss and show others the game and their progress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 version will also incorporate GameChat, enabling players to talk to friends while playing and share their screens in real time. “I’m very excited to see this game playable on a portable system,” Hamaguchi enthused, adding that “I have high hopes that we can build a strong partnership between Nintendo and the Final Fantasy brand.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although only Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade has been confirmed for Switch 2 so far, Hamaguchi ended with, “I hope players are looking forward to the Final Fantasy VII Remake series on Switch 2,” suggesting that Rebirth and the upcoming final entry in the trilogy will also see Switch 2 releases in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the Final Fantasy series originally started out on Nintendo consoles, before switching to the PlayStation 1 and its CD-ROM format for Final Fantasy VII, the first 3D entry, in 1997. With the remake, it seems that FFVII will finally be available on Nintendo hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.
