Capcom rebuilt a survival horror classic with modern controls, polished visuals, and new mechanics that keep it feeling fresh while still honoring the original. If you missed it at full price, this is a great chance to grab it.</p></div><p id="final-fantasy-xvi"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Final Fantasy XVI">Final Fantasy XVI</h2></p><div catalogid="e84a4060-08b0-4b74-91bb-9e749cf3ae4b" id="227692"><div id="227692" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy XVI</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy XVI goes big in every way . Darker storytelling, faster combat, and those cinematic Eikon battles that really show off the PS5’s power. It’s a dense, story-driven game that still feels very approachable thanks to its action-first design. Getting a major release like this for under $25 feels like strong value, especially if you’ve been waiting for the right price to dive in.</p></div><p id="the-boy-and-the-heron"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Boy and The Heron">The Boy and The Heron</h2></p><div catalogid="e84a4060-08b0-4b74-91bb-9e749cf3ae4b" id="227693"><div id="227693" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Boy and The Heron</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is Miyazaki’s latest film and it’s already an award-winner, so owning it on SteelBook is an easy call if you’re a Studio Ghibli fan. Beyond the collectible packaging, there are some worthwhile extras too (interviews, storyboards, behind-the-scenes looks) that make this more than just a standard Blu-ray release. The discount isn’t massive, but it’s still nice to save a few bucks on a title you’d probably want in your library anyway.</p></div><p id="hori-usb-camera-for-nintendo-switch"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="HORI USB Camera for Nintendo Switch ">HORI USB Camera for Nintendo Switch 2</h2></p><div catalogid="e84a4060-08b0-4b74-91bb-9e749cf3ae4b" id="227694"><div id="227694" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Officially Licensed by Nintendo</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>HORI USB Camera for Nintendo Switch 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one’s a little more niche, but I was surprised to see such a steep discount on an officially licensed Switch 2 accessory. HORI’s USB camera works across different play modes and comes with everything you need to set it up right away. It’s not something everyone will need, but if you’ve been curious about adding a camera to your Switch setup, this is a good time to try it without paying full price.</p></div><p id="oreo-gluten-free-original-double-s"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="OREO Gluten Free Original &amp; Double S">OREO Gluten Free Original &amp; Double Stuf</h2></p><div catalogid="e84a4060-08b0-4b74-91bb-9e749cf3ae4b" id="227695"><div id="227695" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>20 Snack Packs (2 Cookies per Pack)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>OREO Gluten Free Original &amp; Double Stuf</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll be honest: this one caught my eye because it’s just a crazy-good pantry deal. Twenty snack packs for just over $5 is tough to beat, especially since gluten-free products rarely see discounts this steep. At about a quarter per pack, these are perfect for tossing in a bag or keeping at your desk.</p></div><p id="007-first-light-preorders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="007 First Light Preorders">007 First Light: Legacy And Standard Edition Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The standard edition of 007 First Light includes the base game for $69.99 and is available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC (via Steam or Epic). Physical copies are offered for all consoles, though Switch 2 uses a game-key card rather than a full cartridge, meaning you’ll still need the card inserted to play but can lend or resell it like a typical game card. Preorders also come with the deluxe edition upgrade at no extra cost, adding early access for digital buyers plus exclusive DLC skins and outfits.<br>For fans who want something more collectible, the Legacy Edition ($299.99) comes packed with extras. Alongside the full game in a steelbook case, it includes a Golden Gun figurine with a stand and hidden compartment, a certificate of authenticity, and a bundle of deluxe DLC skins and outfits. Between the display-worthy replica and the bonus in-game content, this edition is tailored for Bond enthusiasts who want both a showpiece for their shelf and extra flair in-game.</p><p id="lego-disney-pixar-wall-e-eve"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="LEGO Disney &amp; Pixar Wall-E &amp; EVE">LEGO Disney &amp; Pixar Wall-E &amp; EVE</h2></p><div catalogid="e84a4060-08b0-4b74-91bb-9e749cf3ae4b" id="227638"><div id="227638" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Disney &amp; Pixar Wall-E &amp; EVE</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The LEGO Disney &amp; Pixar WALL-E &amp; EVE Building Set (43279) is one of the new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-new-lego-sets-for-september-2025">LEGO sets for September</a>. It comes with 811 pieces and builds four characters from the movie: WALL-E, EVE, M-O, and Hal. Each has movable parts, like WALL-E’s rolling tracks and EVE’s poseable arms, plus small accessories like the plant in a boot. Once built, the figures stand about 5 inches tall and work well as shelf or desk décor.</p></div><p id="euki-compressed-air-duster"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="EUKI Compressed Air Duster">EUKI Compressed Air Duster</h2></p><div catalogid="e84a4060-08b0-4b74-91bb-9e749cf3ae4b" id="227639"><div id="227639" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>EUKI Compressed Air Duster</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>150000RPM Electric Air Duster, Cordless Rechargeable</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The EUKI Compressed Air Duster ($39.99) is a rechargeable alternative to disposable air cans, built with a 150,000 RPM motor and three speed settings for different cleaning tasks. It weighs just 315 grams and can handle everything from clearing dust out of keyboards and PCs to inflating air beds or drying surfaces. A full charge takes about 2.5 hours and provides up to 100 minutes of use, with built-in protections for safe performance. The kit comes with a USB-C cable, storage bag, brushes, and a non-slip handle.</p></div><p id="runbox-slim-card-holder"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Runbox Slim Card Holder">Runbox Slim Card Holder</h2></p><div catalogid="e84a4060-08b0-4b74-91bb-9e749cf3ae4b" id="227640"><div id="227640" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>RFID Blocking Wallet with Pop-Up Function</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Runbox Slim Card Holder</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">RUNBOX Slim Card Holder Wallet is a minimalist aluminum case designed to hold 6–12 cards securely, with a quick-access pop-up button for easy retrieval. At just 0.5 inches thick and 2.6 ounces, it fits comfortably in any pocket while still offering expandable storage thanks to its metal backplate. Built-in RFID blocking helps protect against digital theft, and silicone clips inside keep cards firmly in place.</p></div><p id="phantasmal-flames-preorders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Phantasmal Flames Preorders">Pokémon TCG: Mega Evolution - Phantasmal Flames Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Pokémon Center listings going live for preorder at any moment, it's only a matter of time until the first expansion for the new era of Pokémon TCG, Mega Evolution: Phantasmal Flames, comes pouring down to other retailers. First up will be <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yGl5r?object_uuid=97d94ead-e156-41ee-a9fa-29018626708d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Best Buy</a>, normally around 24 hours after the Pokémon Center launch, followed by <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLMZyP?object_uuid=97d94ead-e156-41ee-a9fa-29018626708d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target</a> then secondary market and small seller allocations being available on <a href="https://zdcs.link/zn5kLy?object_uuid=97d94ead-e156-41ee-a9fa-29018626708d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGPlayer</a>. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxOmm?object_uuid=97d94ead-e156-41ee-a9fa-29018626708d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wjLmK?object_uuid=97d94ead-e156-41ee-a9fa-29018626708d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart</a> have been known to stock <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deals-for-today-september-1">Pokémon TCG preorders</a> in the past, but it's not always a guarantee.<br>Phantasmal Flames drops on November 14, with prerelease events running the week before, and the big headline is <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp4wPo?object_uuid=97d94ead-e156-41ee-a9fa-29018626708d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Charizard X ex</a> returning in full force. What makes this set even more exciting is its size , about 90 cards before secret rares, which makes it the smallest English set in nearly a decade. For collectors like me, that usually means a much more manageable chase, while still packing in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokemon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-august-28">plenty of heavy hitters</a> for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The product lineup looks pretty stacked too. We’ll be getting the usual booster packs and booster box (36 packs), a 9-pack Elite Trainer Box featuring a shiny new Charcadet promo, and an Ultra-Premium Collection built around Mega Charizard X ex. On top of that, two theme decks for Mega Gengar ex and Mega Diancie ex are arriving a few weeks early on October 24, which is a fun way to get a taste of the set before launch. If you’re like me and love cracking packs, the booster box is the way to go, but the UPC is already looking like the big collector piece this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What ties it all together is the <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao6bvY?object_uuid=97d94ead-e156-41ee-a9fa-29018626708d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Japanese set Inferno X</a>, which hit shelves there in late September. That set had only 80 cards, and once you add in the Mega Gengar and Mega Diancie decks, you basically get the full Phantasmal Flames lineup. We’ve already seen some killer reveals, including the Mega Charizard X ex secret rare previewed at Worlds, so I’m fully expecting that to be the chase card when this launches. Between the smaller set size, Charizard hype, and some solid gameplay cards, I think this one’s going to fly off shelves and I’m definitely locking in my preorder.</p><p id="back-to-the-future-steelbooks"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Back To The Future Steelbooks">Back To The Future Steelbook Preorders Are Live</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 40th anniversary Back to the Future steelbooks are a collector’s dream. Each movie in the trilogy is getting its own limited-edition release on October 14, with sleek new steelbook packaging featuring inside-and-out film artwork. Priced between $29.99 and $34.99, each edition includes the movie on 4K UHD, Blu-ray, and digital, along with a treasure trove of bonus features, from archival documentaries and outtakes to new retrospectives with co-writer Bob Gale and cast/crew members.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-holiday-calendar-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Holiday Calendar (2025)">Pokémon TCG: Holiday Calendar (2025) Cheaper At TCGPlayer</h2></p><div catalogid="e84a4060-08b0-4b74-91bb-9e749cf3ae4b" id="227556"><div id="227556" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Holiday Calendar (2025)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2025 Pokémon TCG Holiday Calendar is shaping up to be a holiday highlight for fans without breaking the bank. While Amazon has it listed for $67.94, with the lowest price right now is actually at TCGplayer, where you can snag it for just $61.97. Inside, you’ll get a festive advent-style box with 25 surprises: eight foil promo cards with a snowflake Poké Ball stamp, six booster packs, seven fun packs, two coins, sticker sheets, and a bonus code card for Pokémon TCG Live. With boosters pulled from recent Scarlet &amp; Violet expansions like Destined Rivals and Journey Together, this calendar offers both collectible promos and real gameplay value at the best price you’ll find online today.</p></div><p id="marvel-legends-series-wolverine-prem"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Marvel Legends Series Wolverine Prem">Marvel Legends Series Wolverine Premium Roleplay Mask</h2></p><div catalogid="e84a4060-08b0-4b74-91bb-9e749cf3ae4b" id="227557"><div id="227557" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Preorder: Releases November 1, 2025</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Marvel Legends Series Wolverine Premium Roleplay Mask</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro’s Marvel Legends Series Wolverine Premium Roleplay Mask is a must-have for fans of the clawed mutant, whether you’re into cosplay or just want a striking display piece. Priced at $99.99 and set to release on October 1 (with preorders live now at Amazon), this full-scale 1:1 mask recreates Wolverine’s look from Deadpool &amp; Wolverine. It sports the classic yellow-and-black design with realistic battle damage and white eye screens, giving it a screen-accurate edge. The mask also comes with its own display stand, so it’ll look just as good on a shelf as it does when you wear it.</p></div><p id="thps-34-deal"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="THPS 3+4 Deal">Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3 + 4 Under $35</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of Amazon’s Labor Day sale, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 has dropped to its lowest price yet, making now the perfect time to grab it. Normally priced higher, this updated collection delivers classic arcade skateboarding with a modern polish. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review">In our review where we scored it an 8/10</a>, we praised the game for proving “the series’ over-the-top skateboarding formula is totally timeless,” even if some of the tweaks to THPS4 and the soundtrack choices didn’t fully land. At this price, though, you’re getting an iconic piece of gaming history for less than ever before.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-etbs-and-booster-bundles"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG ETBs and Booster Bundles">Pokémon TCG ETBs and Booster Bundles</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to sealed Pokémon TCG products, the real bargains today are on ETBs and booster bundles. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxABYx?object_uuid=97d94ead-e156-41ee-a9fa-29018626708d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">White Flare</a> is sitting at just $75 on TCGPlayer, which is a nice break from the usual $90+ price tags.

Collectors aren’t waiting for fresh stock of modern Mega Evolutions, they’re going back to the originals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, some cards have spiked dramatically, while others are showing signs of plateauing, creating strong entry points for buyers who want to get ahead of the next wave.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leading the charge is <a href="https://zdcs.link/akw35g?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Rayquaza EX (Shiny Full Art – Ancient Origins)</a>, which has soared from $275.15 in January to a staggering $1,450 today—an increase of over 426%. Meanwhile, <a href="https://zdcs.link/98PeZO?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Gengar EX (Secret Rare – Phantom Forces)</a> has multiplied nearly fivefold since January, now trading at $415. These climbers highlight just how quickly momentum can build around Mega Evolutions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But not every card is running away in price. Some are holding steady after strong climbs earlier this year. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDrYDN?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Alakazam EX (Full Art – Fates Collide)</a> sits at just under $100 after rising from $28.85 in January, but recent weeks show leveling off. For buyers, these plateaus represent a rare chance to secure cards before demand intensifies again when Mega Evolution reclaims the spotlight.</p><p id="climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Climbers">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/feature-image-12-1757078942695.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The clearest winners of 2025’s Mega Evolution run-up are the Rayquaza and Gengar cards. <a href="https://zdcs.link/akw35g?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Rayquaza EX (Shiny Full Art – Ancient Origins)</a> has surged over 426% this year, now commanding $1,450. Its Theta Max ability that heals on evolution and the scaling power of Emerald Break made it a competitive monster in its day, and the shiny black-and-gold artwork cements it as a collector grail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/98PeZO?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Gengar EX (Secret Rare – Phantom Forces)</a> isn’t far behind, up 357% since January to $415. Its Phantom Gate attack let it copy any move from the opponent’s Active Pokémon, a flexible strategy that earned it lasting fan love. The secret rare gold trim adds collector prestige, making this one of the most desirable Megas not named Rayquaza.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also climbing fast is <a href="https://zdcs.link/911JRq?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Rayquaza EX (Full Art – Roaring Skies)</a>, now at $656.93 compared to $164.04 in January. Its Delta Evolution rule bypassed the usual Mega Evolution turn-ending drawback, giving it unique competitive edge at release. The vibrant green artwork adds to its desirability, and while overshadowed by the Shiny Rayquaza, it’s carving its own path upward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wjLYq?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Charizard EX (X – Flashfire)</a> has also doubled and then some, climbing from $126.89 to $349.99. Though its Wild Blaze attack forced players to discard five cards after dealing 300 damage, the Mega X design remains one of Charizard’s most iconic forms. Collectors chasing Charizard cards across eras are pushing this one higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5XJ2L?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Primal Groudon EX (Shiny Full Art – Ancient Origins)</a> has jumped from $126.89 in January to $349.99 today. The Theta Max healing ability and Gaia Volcano’s potential to hit 200 made it a powerhouse in its day, while the shiny crimson-and-gold artwork locks in its collector appeal. Though technically a Primal, it rides the same wave as Mega Evolutions in the current surge.</p><p id="crashers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Crashers">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/feature-image-11-1757078962277.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not every Mega Evolution is continuing to climb. Some have slowed their upward trajectory, making them attractive buys while prices are stable. <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6DeO7?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Primal Groudon EX (Omega Full Art – Primal Clash)</a> has risen from $90.60 in January to $254.93 but is beginning to level off. Its Omega Barrier ability that blocked Trainer effects made it uniquely powerful, and while it’s cooled, the mechanics and artwork give it plenty of long-term upside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2jlx?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Mewtwo EX (Full Art – BREAKthrough)</a> has shown one of the biggest percentage gains, from $37.21 to $145.04. Its Psychic Infinity attack scaled with Energy on both Active Pokémon, giving it offensive versatility. While its growth has slowed compared to Rayquaza and Gengar, this plateau is a clear chance to lock in before it spikes again with the Mega Evolution revival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aDrYDN?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Alakazam EX (Full Art – Fates Collide)</a> has climbed from $28.85 to $99.97 but has now steadied in the $90–100 range. Its Zen Force attack synergized well with spread-damage strategies, though it never became a meta staple. Collectors have kept it relevant, and with prices flatlining, this looks like a buy-and-hold card heading into Pokémon Legends Z-A.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aM8dE4?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Charizard EX (Generations)</a> has tripled from $64.66 to $196, but growth has tapered. Its Heat Typhoon coin-flip mechanic made it more of a novelty card, yet the Generations anniversary branding has cemented its long-term collector appeal. With Charizard’s legacy tied tightly to every new era, this plateau may be short-lived.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjxWG?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Charizard EX (Full Art – Evolutions)</a> mirrors its Generations counterpart, rising from $64.66 to $196 but settling into that range. The Crimson Dive attack packed 300 damage at the cost of self-harm, which limited competitive use, but Evolutions nostalgia has carried it. With the Mega Evolution resurgence on the horizon, this lull feels like a rare buying opportunity before Charizard prices inevitably rise again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight: Silksong may be the sequel to Hollow Knight, but players are quickly finding out that it doesn't exactly play the same way Hollow Knight did. With a new protagonist and new moves, the controls and abilities available might have some players fumbling or struggling, especially when it comes to Silksong's trickier platforming sections. Fortunately, there's a way to switch back to the Hollow Knight moveset available pretty early on, if you really must.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Warning: This article will contain spoilers for Silksong's early game, including the first two major unlockable abilities and one of the earliest bosses. If you haven't thoroughly explored the Deep Docks area just yet, you may want to wait and come back to this later.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hornet's default moveset is very, very different from that of the Knight in Hollow Knight. She has more range than the Knight, but her Needle swings are just a touch slower. She also is unable to "pogo" off of enemies the same way the Knight was - while he could slash downward to bounce off a foe, Hornet can bounce only by shooting downward at a diagonal 45 degree angle. This makes some of the game's jumping puzzles significantly more tricky until you get used to the new abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's my personal recommendation to just practice and get used to Hornet's moveset as the game clearly intends, it's possible that having the Knight's abilities might be a benefit in certain circumstances, or maybe you just want to play that way. For that, you need to get the Wanderer's Crest, which is a different crest with different slots for tools than your default Hunter's Crest.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wanderer's Crest has a few requirements to unlock: you need to have beaten the Bell Beast and unlocked Hornet's sprint ability found in Deep Docks. You'll also need to have a Simple Key with you, which can be acquired easily from the merchant in Bone Bottom. If you've already bought and used that key, you'll have to find one elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With key in hand, head up into Mosshome, and head west as far as possible. Once you get to the elevator room (the one that takes you back down to Bone Bottom), use your dash to cross the big gap, and keep heading west into the Wormways. Progress through the Wormways westward and down to a hut where the crest is waiting for you. Our video above has a far more detailed explanation of how to get this item.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wanderer's Crest does make it a bit harder to fight enemies, especially at range, but can make exploration easier, so just be warned. You can swap it out any time at a bench, and experiment with both crests and figure out which one works for you. We're just getting started with Silksong, so who knows, maybe there will be even more crests out there with cool new abilities waiting for us to find them!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight: Silksong is out now, and we're <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong">hard at work on our Wiki guides</a> of everything you might possibly want to know as you start your adventures in Pharloom. We've also got a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-review">review-in-progress covering our thoughts so far</a> that we'll update with a score as soon as we've finished the game.
