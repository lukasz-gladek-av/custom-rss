The reveal comes alongside a message from game director Josh Sawyer (last seen directing Pentiment), with his thoughts on what turn-based mode means for Pillars of Eternity.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fans who enjoyed experimenting with turn-based mode in Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire will find familiar ground here, but with key improvements shaped by your feedback,” <a href="https://eternity.obsidian.net/eternity/news/eternity/public-beta-for-turn-based-mode" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obsidian said in a blog post</a>. More details are below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How turn-based mode works in Pillars of Eternity:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Unbound Turns:</strong> All turns are now influenced by a character’s overall speed, improving the value of Real-Time with Pause attributes and mechanics.</li><li><strong>Smarter Free Actions:</strong> Actions like swapping weapons, drinking potions, or enabling modals are now free actions. Each free action is limited to one per turn per type for balance.</li><li><strong>Faster Pacing:</strong> Combat lethality has been significantly increased for both enemies and players to keep battles tense and impactful.</li><li><strong>Mode Flexibility:</strong> You can choose Turn-Based Mode alongside difficulty when starting a new game — or swap freely between Real-Time with Pause and Turn-Based Mode in the game options. We’re also investigating a direct HUD toggle for even more convenience.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">As this is a public beta, please expect bugs and ongoing adjustments, Obsidian warned. The beta will run for “some time” as the developer continues to roll out updates and prepares for a full release.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/03/eternity-turnbased-menu-1762196302444.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pillars of Eternity now has turn-based mode. Image credit: Obsidian.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/27/pillars-of-eternity-review">Pillars of Eternity review</a> returned a 9/10 back in 2015. We said at the time: “Obsidian (and its Kickstarter backers) have done it: Pillars of Eternity is one of the best RPGs since Baldur's Gate.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian followed PoE up with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire">Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</a> in 2018, before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/10/microsoft-to-acquire-obsidian-entertainment-inxile-entertainment">Microsoft bought the company later that year</a>. Obsidian went on to release the likes of The Outer Worlds and Grounded, and has become one of the most prolific Xbox Games Studios developers Microsoft has on its books.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will there be a Pillars of Eternity 3? Sawyer has commented on the prospect in the past. In 2023, for example, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/josh-sawyer-would-make-pillars-of-eternity-3-if-given-a-baldurs-gate-3-sized-budget">Sawyer said he would love to develop Pillars of Eternity 3 — under the condition the game receives the same budget as <u>Baldur's Gate 3</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think if it truly was an unlimited budget, I think I would try Pillars 3 because I know what the budget was for Deadfire, which was not a whole lot and I have heard from multiple people what the budget was for Baldur’s Gate 3, and I’m not gonna talk about numbers, but if I got that budget, sure, I’ll make Pillars 3,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sawyer added that if he were to make Pillars 3, he would employ a turn-based combat structure. Obsidian has yet to announce its next game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
