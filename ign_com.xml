What it didn't address, however, is the forced 4:3 resolution, and while there will undoubtedly be players happy to jump in and experience the game in its native resolution, the 2013 edition that this new version replaces <em>did</em> let you select other resolutions, leaving some wondering why on earth this was changed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem is compounded even further given this new version of the game replaces the 2013 Steam edition on the Steam storefront entirely, so players looking to buy Final Fantasy 7 for the first time will only have this option available — only those who already owned the 2013 edition are able to switch between the two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The battle animation speeds are WAY too high, even without the 3x speed, so the game just plays wrong and feels wrong right now. Hopefully, they fix this," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994004728/recommended/3837340/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a> one player. "In addition, you appear to be locked into a 4:3 display, which makes sense as the original format, and many people will prefer to have it that way, but even the 2013 PC version has the ability to stretch it to full screen (which is how I prefer). This should be an option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's very hard to recommend. May I suggest that companies make sure their re-releases at least function on a basic level before delisting their old versions? That'[d] be great," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/StilesReviews/recommended/3837340/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a> another. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'd just play the 2013 version without glasses on if I wanted the game to look like this," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198141637633/recommended/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>quipped</u></a> someone else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, the issues have brought the game's overall Steam user rating down to 'Mostly Negative,' with just 36% of players leaving positive feedback.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the remake? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3"><u>Final Fantasy Remake Part 3</u></a> director Naoki Hamaguchi recently discussed the impact of expanding the platforms on which the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series is available, insisting that going multiplatform "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-remake-series-going-multiplatform-will-not-lower-quality-of-part-3-director-insists-while-acknowledging-fan-concern"><u>will not in any way lower the quality of the third instalment.</u></a>"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Both the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox versions have been incredibly well received and generated a lot of buzz online," Hamaguchi said. "That attention has also made me realize how many people are worried about this issue. However, our decision to go multiplatform with the FF7 Remake series will not in any way lower the quality of the third installment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also recently learned that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-director-issues-update-on-part-3-progress-and-reveals-clouds-iconic-buster-sword-was-almost-resized-to-make-it-more-realistic"><u>"core game experience is almost complete,"</u></a> and while Hamaguchi "really want[s] everyone to play it as soon as possible," the team has now moved on to "refining and polishing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Saints Row 1 design director Chris Stockman has said he believes the series is now “dead” and that owner Embracer has “zero ability” to do anything with the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The one-time Grand Theft Auto competitor hasn’t seen a new entry since 2022’s ill-fated reboot, Saints Row. It received a mixed reception from fans, with IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saints-row-2022-review">Saints Row review</a> returning a 6/10. “Saints Row delivers no shortage of shallow shoot 'em up thrills, but it's a very familiar and uninspired brand of sandbox fun,” we said at the time. Sales were depressed, and developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saints-row-developer-volition-shut-down-by-embracer-group">Volition shut down in 2023</a>. We haven’t heard about Saints Row from Embracer since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, is Saints Row dead? Stockman, speaking in the Discord for his studio, Bit Planet Games, said he thinks it is, having pitched a revival to Embracer (via subsidiary Plaion) and heard nothing back.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Stockman, who left Volition during pre-production of Saints Row 2, said last month: “... honestly, I think the franchise is dead, unfortunately. I get the sense that Embracer has zero ability to do anything with it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “I wish things were different. I tried my best to offer a path forward but they've ghosted me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN asked Embracer for a statement on Stockman’s comments and for a status update on Saints Row, but a spokesperson said the company does not comment on “rumors and speculation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, Stockman clarified he’d spoken to Plaion about Saints Row, and he asked about the possibility of selling the IP, “but as I mentioned before they refuse to respond to my messages and emails.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Companies of that size almost never sell their IP because it, ultimately, devalues their purchase price if they decide to sell or try to take on investment,” Stockman said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of all this is Saints Row celebrates its 20th anniversary this year (the first game came out on August 29, 2006) and it feels like a new game in the series is further away than ever. But one thing seems clear: if the company does have a secret plan for a new Saints Row, Stockman isn’t involved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As long as they [Embracer] are in business they own it,” Stockman added. “If they went out of business or filed for bankruptcy it would get auctioned off to the highest bidder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They could license it to me or contract us to manage it. But I've done all I can do to try and make that happen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upcoming Embracer games include Killing Floor 3, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, the Embracer-owned Crystal Dynamics' new Tomb Raider games, and Darksiders 4. The fate of the Lord of the Rings MMO, developed by Amazon Games in collaboration with Embracer-owned Middle-earth Enterprises, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-looks-like-amazons-the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-is-dead">is unclear</a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-island-3-due-out-first-half-of-2028-all-developers-at-dambuster-studios-now-working-on-it">Dead Island 3 is in the works at Dambuster Studios</a>, and is due out in the first half of 2028.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">After parent company failed to make a loan repayment.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">AA publisher and developer Nacon has filed for insolvency, raising questions over the future of games such as GreedFall 2, Hell is Us, RoboCop, and Test Drive Unlimited.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nacon, which is home to 16 development studios as well as a publishing arm, said it was forced into the decision after its majority shareholder, Bigben Interactive, failed to make a loan repayment. It has now asked a French court for permission to restructure its debt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The aim of this procedure is to assess all possible solutions to ensure the sustainability of the Company's activity under the best possible conditions, protect employees, and preserve jobs, while renegotiating with its creditors in a calm and constructive framework,” Nacon said. This procedure will enable the Company to continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan.” The Court is expected to make its decision at a hearing in early March.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nacon has a number of AA games under its belt, including GreedFall 2: The Dying World, which will release in its full 1.0 version on March 12. Nacon this week alerted press to its annual showcase event, dubbed Nacon Connect, which was set for March 4. It is expected to show off the likes of Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss, The Mound, Edge of Memories, and Endurance Motorsport Series. And just this morning Nacon launched the third major update for Dragonkin: The Banished, which is still in Early Access.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The publisher just released Styx: Blades of Greed last week. RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business came out last year, as did Rogue Factor’s Hell is Us. IGN has asked Nacon for comment on its ability to continue to release its games and maintain and support those it has out already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BBI, which currently holds 56.72% of the share capital and 65.79%% of the voting rights of Nacon, announced last week that it was unable to make a partial repayment of €43 million “due to the unexpected refusal of its banking pool to respond to the drawdown notice.” At the time, Nacon issued a warning to the financial markets, and suspended trading in the company’s shares.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nacon’s hope now is that it gets approval from the court to restructure its debt. If it is successful, its existing liabilities will be frozen for a period that could last up to 18 months.
