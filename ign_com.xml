The DualSense Wireless Controller – Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Limited Edition (that's a mouthful) is live exclusively on PlayStation Direct.

Unlike some previous <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-ps5-dualsense-colors-in-order">special PS5 controllers</a>, it's not going to be available at other retailers, so PlayStation Direct is your only option.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">DualSense Wireless Controller – Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Limited Edition</h3></div></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to add this controller to your collection, I'd buy it sooner than later. Limited-edition PS5 controllers can sell out pretty fast, and this one's not coming back once it's gone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

Cards 1 to 6 are commons, while card 7 is a common card that can be a reprint.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cards 8, 9 and 10 are uncommons, while card 11 offers your rare/mythic. Card 12 is a Land card, and can be foil or have full art, while card 13 is a “wildcard” that can be any card from the set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then you get a wildcard that’s a guaranteed foil for card 14, with the idea being that players have more of a chance to get chase cards from these packs. You can buy Play Boosters individually or pick up a booster box.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Collector Boosters</strong></h2></div><div catalogid="94b54171-eaaf-4c97-80de-ec7f173ad800" id="221380"><div id="221380" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Magic The Gathering Edge of Eternities </p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Collector Booster Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QdbZKv?object_uuid=3efc094b-e8cc-426c-9758-676bc0cb13c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Collector Boosters</a> are much pricier than their Play Booster counterparts, and offer 16 cards (although again, one is a token).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In these, you can find five rare or mythic rares, as well as four uncommons and five commons, as well as one land.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They’ll also come with a slicker frame design in many instances, with 12 - 13 of the cards included being foils.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, you can pick them up individually or as a box, but expect to pay a high price.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Commander Decks</strong></h2></div><div catalogid="68c5303f-343c-4857-ba51-6f68440e7059" id="215687"><div id="215687" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Edge of Eternities Commander Deck Bundle - 2 of Each Deck</h3></p></div><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgRee?object_uuid=3efc094b-e8cc-426c-9758-676bc0cb13c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">World Shaper Commander Deck<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QdbBqj?object_uuid=3efc094b-e8cc-426c-9758-676bc0cb13c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Counter Intelligence Commander Deck<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBpnKb?object_uuid=3efc094b-e8cc-426c-9758-676bc0cb13c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Commander</a> has become Magic’s most popular format, with the thrill of “last player standing” matches and 100-card decks playable right out of the box making for a great jumping-on point for new players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The number of decks included in each set has varied wildly this year. For example, Aetherdrift offered two Commander options, while Tarkir: Dragonstorm had a whopping five, and Final Fantasy offers four.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Edge of Eternities is scaling back the volume, with two decks: World Shaper and Counter Intelligence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The former comes in Black, Red, and Green colors (Jund), and the text on the box says players will “Sacrifice Lands” and “Grow Back Stronger”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Counter Intelligence, on the other hand, is Blue, Red, and White (Jeskai) and says you can use its contents to “Boost Artifacts” and “Proliferate Counters”.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Bundles and Prerelease Packs</strong></h2></div><div catalogid="94b54171-eaaf-4c97-80de-ec7f173ad800" id="221379"><div id="221379" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Magic The Gathering Edge of Eternities Bundle</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, as is tradition now you’ll be able to pick up a <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgJYN?object_uuid=3efc094b-e8cc-426c-9758-676bc0cb13c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bundle</a> and Prerelease Pack for the new set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bundles include a series of 9 Play Boosters, as well as one promo card with exclusive alternate art, as well as a full set of 10 Full-Art Lands in foil and non-foil, as well as a spindown dice and a card storage box. Prerelease works a little differently, with the idea being that the set is used at a prerelease event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players open the box, and use the six Play Boosters inside to build a deck comprising of 40 cards. Prerelease boxes are found at your local game store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is Gaming Editor @ Daily Star.
