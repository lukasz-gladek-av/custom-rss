The game launches with 15 playable characters, which means four are still to be announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the voice cast, Matt Mercer from Critical Role is set to play Nova and Annihilus.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Marvel Cosmic Invasion voice cast (so far):</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Brian Bloom (Captain America, Silver Surfer)</li><li>Steve Blum (Venom, Beta Ray Bill)</li><li>Trevor Devall (Rocket Raccoon)</li><li>Cal Dodd (Wolverine)</li><li>Josh Keaton (Spider-Man)</li><li>Matt Mercer (Nova, Annihilus)</li><li>Aileen Mythen (Phyla-Vell)</li><li>Elysia Rotaru (She-Hulk)</li><li>Alison Sealy-Smith (Storm)</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel Cosmic Invasion Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Cosmic Invasion is due out later this year on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5 and Xbox. Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>In Marvel Cosmic Invasion, the immortal Super Villain Annihilus has launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy, threatening all life as we know it. Super Heroes both Earth-born and cosmic must now join forces in a star-spanning adventure against the deadly Annihilation Wave. Brawl through the streets of New York City all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone to foil Annihilus’ vow to spread death across the cosmos in classically inspired side-scrolling combat.</blockquote><blockquote>Choose and control your own team of two characters while tagging between them mid-fight with the innovative Cosmic Swap system, capitalizing on distinct superpowers and special attacks to create unique team-ups and dish out devastating damage. Unlock stellar powerups and rewards while experimenting with different duos and bash through a fantastic collection of locales and nemeses from the Marvel universe. Marvel Cosmic Invasion’s action includes a range of accessibility features, empowering the whole family to be Super Heroes (or villains), and supports four-player drop-in/drop-out local and online co-op with crossplay.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"There's a 99% chance they're going to be in the game."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">We currently know six of the playable characters in fighting game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/invincible-vs">Invincible VS</a>. There will be more, of course. But just how many? Based on comments from Invincible creator Robert Kirkman in an interview with IGN at San Diego Comic-Con 2025, Invincible VS will have a massive roster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Invincible VS is the upcoming 3v3 tag fighting game set in the Invincible universe. It’s developed by Skybound Entertainment’s first in-house game studio, Quarter Up. Already confirmed Invincible VS characters include Mark Grayson (Invincible), Atom Eve, Thula, Bulletproof, and Rex Splode. Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-vs-is-a-brutal-bloody-3v3-tag-fighter"><u>Invincible VS preview</u></a> from June for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh from his SDCC 2025 panel where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robert-kirkman-reveals-battle-beast-as-a-playable-character-in-invincible-vs-with-debut-trailer-sdcc-2025">he announced Battle Beast for Invincible VS</a>, Kirkman told IGN that if fans are wondering if a specific character from either the Invincible comic or the Prime Video animated series will be in the game, there’s a “99%” chance they will be.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This, the ever chatty Kirkman added, was perhaps a spoiler.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There's so much care being put into being true to the Invincible universe,” Kirkman began. “So if you're a fan of the comics or the show and you're like, ‘Oh, there's a fighting game coming, who would I like to be in that fighting game?’ There's a 99% chance they're going to be in the game. I'll just say that. That's a spoiler. I might get in trouble for that. I don't know.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirkman continued: “The lineup is going to be absolutely insane. I'm so glad that we announced Battle Beast. You can't do an Invincible fighting game without having Battle Beast be one of the playable characters. There are other characters like that that will more than likely be in the game. So we'll see. We've got a lot of announcements to roll out. There's a really great team working on this and I can't wait for people to see everything is going into it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who would you like to see playable in Invincible VS? Let us know in the comments below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for when Invincible VS will be released, Kirkman said 2026, which we knew already, but then he added: “Sooner than you may think… But next year. I'm not being specific.” Interesting...</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out IGN's roundup of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-season-4s-dinosaurus-has-a-voice-actor-robert-kirkman-says-7-9-seasons-needed-to-do-the-complete-comic-arc-jokes-season-5-will-be-out-in-2032-sdcc-2025">everything announced during Robert Kirkman's Invincible panel at SDCC 2025</a> for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h45Sr1kafGU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>resulting video</u></a> is quite funny, showing the new Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) family as they fumble through a few matches as their in-game counterparts.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Meet the family! ✨Marvel Studios The Fantastic Four: First Steps cast's genuine reactions as they try out Marvel Rivals! 😄 <a href="https://t.co/sq8lwMh7pp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/sq8lwMh7pp</a></p>— Marvel Rivals (@MarvelRivals) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/1948513591134679137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's goofy and occasionally hard to watch as Pascal flails his stretchy arms at enemies, but the highlight is no doubt the Fantastic Four cast’s reaction to Invisible Woman’s infamous Marvel Rivals Malice skin. Fans of the game had already taken the time to see everything the shockingly revealing outfit had to offer when it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/marvel-rivals/Season_1_Battle_Pass_and_New_Skins#Malice_Invisible_Woman_Skin">its debut with Season 1</a> in January. On the eve of the new Fantastic Four movie’s premiere, though, the cast is only just seeing it for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby is the first to joke about the skin: “Thank you. This is my favorite bit of her as well,” she says of the video game version of her Fantastic Four character. “This is my favorite bit. Guys, watch out, like I said, for the sequel. You better watch it.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fantastic Four: First Steps, of course, has yet to receive the green light for a proper MCU sequel, though we do know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-pedro-pascals-reed-richards-lead-the-avengers-the-fantastic-four-first-steps-director-clarifies-previous-comments-insists-its-for-the-russo-brothers-to-reveal"><u>at least some of its major characters</u></a> will make an appearance in the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday. Invisible Woman’s evil black-and-red Malice skin probably won’t make it into the MCU, but the slack-jawed Pascal still shared some of his thoughts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Here we go,” Pascal said. “Costume designer, take notes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Loserfruit’s video also includes the Fantastic Four cast’s reaction to other Marvel Rivals cosmetics, including Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman’s The Life Fantastic wedding skins. Of course, it’s how all four actors reacted to the Malice skin that has started to achieve viral status.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The best of both worlds for backers and creators.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a surprising turn of events, Indiegogo, one of the largest global crowdfunding platforms second only to Kickstarter, has been acquired by board game crowdfunding site Gamefound.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/blog/post/gamefound-acquires-indiegogo?ref=info-banner_1-152" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joint announcement</a>, Gamefound revealed it will be integrating its technology to enhance the Indiegogo platform, offering creators and backers more powerful tools than ever before. These include over 20 payment options, a full-featured mobile app, built-in marketing tools, and more robust pledge management. Indiegogo will also adopt Gamefound's flat 5% fee structure, putting more money in creators' pockets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s time for crowdfunding to be a forward-facing industry again,” said Julie dePontbriand, CEO of Indiegogo in the official release. “Gamefound’s technology is unrivaled, and we’re thrilled to bring it to Indiegogo’s diverse community. Together, we’re making crowdfunding more innovative, creator-friendly, and exciting than ever before.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two sites will continue operating independently for now, with Gamefound remaining focused on tabletop games and Indiegogo continuing to promote tech, film, and other creative projects. In the near future, Gamefound campaigns will also be discoverable through Indiegogo, opening the door to a much broader audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiegogo is one of the original crowdfunding pioneers, having launched over 17 years ago. In that time, it has amassed 38 million members and raised more than $3 billion for projects across the globe. By combining Indiegogo’s global reach with Gamefound’s cutting-edge infrastructure, the partnership might finally give Kickstarter a run for its money.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What does this mean for the board game industry?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, this acquisition is a massive win for the board game industry. Gamefound will soon be cross-promoting its tabletop campaigns through Indiegogo, allowing creators to get in front of millions of new customers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With fewer fees and more native tools to help promote projects, creators may finally start shifting away from Kickstarter for new campaigns. Since Gamefound doesn't have a paid promotion feature like Kickstarter Boost, it levels the playing field for smaller creators, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Large publishers are already favoring Gamefound, with six of the ten <a href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/520142/gamefound-top-10-biggest-board-game-crowdfund-campaigns" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largest board game projects in 2024</a> successfully funded there, including the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-the-board-game-funded-in-10-minutes">Cyberpunk 2077 board game that reached its goal in ten minutes</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matthew Adler has written for IGN since 2019 covering all things gaming, tech, tabletop games, and more.
