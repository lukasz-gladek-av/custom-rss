            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-have-made-their-own-battle-format-that-bans-ex-monsters<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Don't bring an EX to a NOEX fight.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon TCG Pocket continues to be ridiculously popular, but in the early days of the game there are only a limited number of ways to engage with other players. Trading still hasn't been released yet, and battling only has one regular format that lets you start a match with a friend, or a random player. So in order to spice things up, the community is coming up with its own workarounds, including a brand new battle format that's been very well-received so far: NOEX.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"NOEX" is a battle format with one simple rule: no EX Pokemon allowed. EX Pokemon, if you're unfamiliar, are ultra-powerful monsters that are very difficult to defeat, but which award two points upon destruction as opposed to just one. Due to their sheer power, most good meta decks in Pocket are built around at least one EX card, and the end result is that you tend to run into a lot of the same decks over and over when you engage in random battles. For the last month or so, for instance, I've been playing a deck that revolves around Pikachu EX, and have been fighting a lot of Mewtwo EX, Charizard EX, and Starmie EX.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But in NOEX, all those cards are banned, which forces players to build decks around other Pokemon for some interesting combos. For this article, I engaged in a couple of NOEX battles myself. In one match I faced a Butterfree/Dugtrio stall deck that I'd never seen before that decimated my army of Nidoran, and in another I barely scraped out a win against a wacky Dragonite/Weezing combo thanks to a lucky final draw. It's a fun format if you want to shake things up a bit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, NOEX exists on an honor system. There's no way to officially create your own battle formats in Pocket just yet, so players have created this by word-of-mouth. If you want to join a NOEX battle, simply select "Private Match" under battles, and use "NOEX" as the password. But you're essentially on your honor to use a deck with no EX Pokemon, as there's nothing in the system to stop you. Some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gvrqsl/ah_yeah_thats_the_kind_of_opener_you_want_to_see/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players are already complaining about opponents bringing EX Pokemon to a NOEX fight</a> and ruining their fun - an unfortunate hazard of a community-created format.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/20/screenshot-2024-11-20-143838-1732135159067.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: /u/Boomerhands420 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gvryhu/noex_format_is_insanely_fun/">Reddit</a>.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, it sounds like NOEX is otherwise going pretty well. Community members are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gvryhu/noex_format_is_insanely_fun/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">praising it on Reddit</a>, and while my personal experience is limited, the speed with which I was able to get into matches with others who were respecting the format indicates this might have legs. It also sounds like some players are suggesting other types of formats that can be done in the same way, such as only allowing a single EX card per deck, or no decks considered by the community to be "S-tier."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopefully, it won't be long before we start to see new features creep in that will hopefully eliminate the need for the community to invent stuff to do. We've already learned that there's a "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-is-getting-more-booster-packs-before-2025">major update</a>" coming in the near future that will include trading, and new booster packs on the way will hopefully spice up the meta a bit as well. Given how <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-made-120-million-in-3-weeks">wildly popular TCG Pocket is</a>, the updates can't come fast enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-just-raised-its-battle-pass-price-for-the-first-time-ever<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Epic is making major changes starting next month.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games is making some changes to its Fortnite Battle Pass model that will see its standard pass getting a price increase in just a few weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gaming mega company talked players through its plans in <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-crew-will-include-the-battle-pass-lego-pass-music-pass-and-more-starting-in-december" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post on its website today</u></a>. While the update details various adjustments, such as new inclusions for Fortnite Crew subscribers, the thing that’s likely to affect most battle royale fans is the slight increase in cost for the Battle Pass. Fortnite has long offered its standard pass for 950 V-Bucks, but starting December 1, the price will increase by 50, bringing the total asking number to 1,000 V-Bucks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has reached out to Epic Games for comment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/03/fortnitechapter4seasonoggameplaytrailer-ign-blogroll-1699018654708.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite Battle Pass V-Bucks price increase arrives in December.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a small increase in price but still undeniably notable considering Epic hasn’t altered the cost of the Fortnite Battle Pass in the past. The studio does clarify that the real-world cost of its popular digital currency will remain unchanged (you can pick up 1,000 V-Bucks on the Epic Games Store for $8.99 right now), and you’ll still be able to earn chunks of V-Bucks by reaching certain Battle Pass levels, too. While any increase in price may be worrying for fans, Epic adds that the price of its 25 Battle Pass Reward Bundle is going down from 1,850 to 1,800. IGN has reached out to Epic for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These tiny but fundamental changes arrive ahead of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-confirms-og-experience-returns-in-december-but-this-time-its-here-to-stay"><u>highly anticipated launch of Fortnite OG: Chapter 1 – Season 1</u></a> on December 6. Part of the shift to allow players to enjoy the classic battle royale experience will see the $12.99 Fortnite Crew deal sweetened to include even more goodies. The bundle currently grants subscribers the standard Fortnite Battle Pass, 1,000 V-Bucks, monthly Crew Pack outfits, Crew Pack outfit styles, and Rocket League’s Premium Rocket Pass. Starting December 1, it will be expanded to include the Music Pass and LEGO Pass without asking subscribers for a penny more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an enticing offer that will no doubt keep players investing their time in Epic’s gaming ecosystem, especially considering that earning XP in any one of the related games will progress all of their battle passes simultaneously. A Crew subscription will also grant access to any additional passes that arrive in the future, including the new, yet-to-be-detailed Fortnite OG Pass.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The catch with the Fortnite Crew upgrade is that new subscribers who sign up after December 1 will no longer be able to unlock premium rewards from the passes after their subscription is no longer active. It means that if you sign up for Crew and then cancel shortly after, you’ll only be able to claim rewards for the remainder of your billing period. Players are currently able to cancel Crew and still reap the benefits of the remaining Battle Pass as long as it’s live, and this won’t be changing for those who are currently subscribed and remain subscribed after the changes take effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic is making major changes as it looks to the future with the permanent nostalgia-fueled Fortnite OG mode. The company is currently in the midst of Chapter 5: Season 5, which will conclude when Chapter 6: Season 1 kicks off next month. Details on its theme and exact contents remain under wraps, so while we wait for more information, be sure to check out the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-limited-edition-fortnite-dualsense-controller"><u>Fortnite-themed PlayStation 5 DualSense controller</u></a> that released earlier this month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
