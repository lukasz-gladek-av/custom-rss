            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Crown Zenith market has been sending some mixed signals this month. While some Galarian Gallery Ultra Rares are dipping in value, Secret Rares are heating up thanks to collector demand and limited availability. Mid-tier fan-favorites like <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7NAR?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leafeon VSTAR</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1y0V?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Suicune V</a> are seeing downward pressure, while the golden Secret Rares – particularly <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJk3k?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Giratina VSTAR</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgB5n?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arceus VSTAR</a> – continue to climb. Crown Zenith’s overall collector appeal remains high, but the card-to-card movement tells a more nuanced story.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Crashers and Climbers This Week</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the climber side, I’ve seen <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJk3k?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Giratina VSTAR (Secret)</a> make a strong move from around $152 in July to as high as $180 recently. That’s a healthy 18% jump, and it tracks with what I’m seeing in collector circles: people are still chasing the big four gold cards, and Giratina seems to be the crown jewel. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qqwlvp?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mewtwo VSTAR</a> has also caught some upward momentum lately, jumping from around $102 to nearly $127. It’s not just about nostalgia with this one – <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAvMk?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">its twin art featuring the Charizard faceoff</a> is iconic and playable decks still find room for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the flipside, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7NAR?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leafeon VSTAR</a> has slipped from its February peak of $49.87 down to about $45.54. That’s not a dramatic crash, but it’s enough to suggest the hype has faded a bit. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2DoN?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deoxys VMAX</a> is feeling a sharper drop, now sitting around $36 after once approaching $45. These cards were never unplayable, but they’re not commanding the same attention in the meta or from collectors.</p><p id="pokmon-card-crashers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Card Crashers">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/28/feature-image-5-1756393956460.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7NAR?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leafeon VSTAR</a> was riding high earlier this year, mostly on the strength of its gorgeous Galarian Gallery artwork and the general hype around Eeveelutions. But lately, it’s slipped about 9% in value. I think this one’s a mix of over-saturation and fading competitive relevance. Ivy Star is a solid switch ability, and Leaf Guard can wall a bit of damage, but the format’s gotten faster and more aggressive, and Leafeon just isn’t keeping up. It’s still a nice display piece, but with more copies floating around and other Secret Rares taking the spotlight, it’s drifting down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/znxm48?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon VSTAR</a> is in a similar boat. It’s down about 10% from its February highs, currently sitting around $43. Crystal Star offers decent protection, and Icicle Shot has some control value, but let’s be honest – no one’s building their deck around this card anymore. Like Leafeon, its value was inflated by early demand from collectors chasing the full Eeveelution spread, but that moment seems to have passed. It’s still a strong artwork, but in today’s market, that’s not enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2DoN?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deoxys VMAX</a> has dropped nearly 20% since February, and I’m not surprised. Protective DNA is a cool ability on paper, reducing damage from opposing VSTARs, but it’s a little too niche in practice. Max Drain heals and hits for 160, which was decent a few metas ago, but now it feels underpowered. Players aren’t reaching for it, and collectors are more focused on the cleaner, flashier Secret Rares.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1y0V?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Suicune V</a> has taken a heavier hit, dropping around 24% since May. This one hurts a little because I still think Blizzard Rondo and Fleet-Footed give it solid play value. But it’s been power-crept hard, and its role in decks has diminished. The artwork is still clean, and there’s nostalgia here, but in the context of the Galarian Gallery, it’s getting outshined. With so many cards in the set, not every V is going to hold long-term value.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l3W5R?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Raikou V</a> has followed a similar path, slipping about 22% since March. It’s basically Suicune V’s Lightning-type twin, with the same draw ability and scalable damage based on benched Pokémon. Again, decent in a vacuum, but there are just better, more dynamic options now. This feels like a victim of set fatigue – there are too many similar cards in Crown Zenith, and only the top-tier ones are holding collector or player attention.</p><p id="pokmon-card-climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Card Climbers">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/28/feature-image-4-1756393853900.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJk3k?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Giratina VSTAR (Secret)</a> is having a real moment. It’s jumped nearly 18% in the last month, and honestly, I think it still has more room to grow. Lost Impact and Star Requiem are both game-ending tools in the right deck, and the alt-art gold treatment puts it near the top of many collectors’ wishlists. If you’re looking for a high-end Crown Zenith card to hold, this one feels as stable as it gets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qqwlvp?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mewtwo VSTAR</a> has quietly surged too, climbing around 24% since June. Star Raid and Psy Purge both offer serious utility, especially in matchups where you want to punish your opponent for loading their board with Vs. But let’s be real – this one’s rising just as much for the art as the gameplay. That Charizard vs. Mewtwo scene is one of the most memorable alt-arts in the set, and people are starting to grab it before prices push any higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgB5n?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Arceus VSTAR (Secret)</a> has seen a solid 14% boost, and it’s one of those cards that straddles playability and collectibility perfectly. Starbirth is still one of the strongest consistency abilities in the game, letting you grab any two cards from your deck. Trinity Nova helps ramp energy quickly, which is never out of style. The gold art has a premium feel, and with Arceus being such a central figure in the franchise, it’s an easy card to like long-term.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8g4b?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Origin Forme Dialga VSTAR (Secret)</a> is up 16% since July, and I think people are finally waking up to just how powerful Star Chronos can be. Taking an extra turn is one of the rarest effects in the game, and when paired with the right energy acceleration, it’s absolutely devastating. Metal Blast scales well too. From a collector standpoint, the gear-and-time themed art is eye-catching, and scarcity is keeping demand high.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qbbwgx?object_uuid=623c07dd-632c-4e1d-9534-a9037a2d8749&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Finally, Origin Forme Palkia VSTAR (Secret)</a> has climbed around 13%. Star Portal remains one of the best ways to recycle Water Energy, and Subspace Swell scales nicely with full benches, which are common in current lists. The art has a dynamic, aquatic style that’s really grown on people. It may not be as flashy as Giratina, but it’s a steady riser, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see it break the $70 mark soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

This is a potentially different weapon than the Power Axe shown off in the trailer, so the hope is it functions in a fresh way as well as looks unique.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the year, the Season Pass II will grant players nine new DLCs, with new Champion skins, armour pieces, and heraldry markings. While existing Chapters like the Blood Angels and Salamanders are to receive new cosmetics, fan-favorite Chapters like the Raptors, Iron Hands, and Carcharodons will get their due time in the spotlight.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/28/unnamed-12-1756393367664.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Space Marine 2 Year 2 DLC roadmap.
