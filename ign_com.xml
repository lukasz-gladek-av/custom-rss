This one's a biggie, too: it's called Celestial Guardians, and it's themed around Pokemon Sun and Moon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Celestial Guardians officially releases on April 30, and is a bigger expansion than the last couple, with two different types of booster packs themed around legendaries Solgaleo and Lunala. It primarily features Alolan Pokemon, including the three starters Rowlet, Litten, and Popplio, as well as regional variants such as Alolan Raichu and Marowak. And of course, it comes with new trainer cards, themed around popular characters from the Alola region, and new ways to display your collection such as a new binder cover and display board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, the set also appears to include what looks like two versions of the starter trio, a daytime and a nighttime version, each with different stats and abilities. It's unclear how prevalent this split is going to be throughout the set, but it could make for some interesting decks if there are multiple paths to getting the same cards out on the field.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokemon TCG Pocket Celestial Guardians Expansion First Look</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Celestial Guardians is the sixth expansion so far and the third major one, following major expansions Genetic Apex and Space-Time Smackdown and smaller expansions Mythical Island, Triumphant Light, and the most recent, Shining Revelry. At the time this piece was written, none of these expansions have been retired yet, but it's perhaps only a matter of time before we say goodbye to Genetic Apex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Pokemon TCG Pocket has kept up the pace with roughly one new expansion per month, alongside regular in-game solo and competitive events. Alongside collecting and battling, TCG Pocket also implemented trading earlier this year, but the feature was widely panned due to its high cost barrier and lack of useful trading feature, forcing the developer to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-confirms-changes-to-much-loathed-trading-system-are-coming-eventually">confirm changes were on the way</a>... months down the road. Nevertheless, the game has been successful, and is estimated to have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-made-half-a-billion-dollars-in-less-than-3-months">made half a billion dollars in less than three months</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Everything more or least gets buried. We don’t have the cash nor muscle to throw around, so everything is carefully planned. Including when to release, based on other releases etc - to try to maximize the chances of getting attention.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Antonsson then pointed to Red Soul Games’ Post Trauma, which Raw Fury published on April 22. It’s a puzzle horror game inspired by PS2 era classics where you “navigate environments, tackle threats, and meet other lost characters in the depths of the Gloom.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Love the game that dropped but feel the pain for our team and especially the developer we’ve worked with for years - who has poured his heart and soul into his game,” Antonsson said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raw Fury had tweeted sarcastically on April 22: “Thank god Post Trauma was the only notable release of today and nothing else happened!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From Bethesda and parent company Microsoft’s point of video, the Oblivion Remastered shadow-drop has been a big success. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-launches-big-on-steam-and-its-only-going-to-get-bigger">The game enjoyed an impressive start on Steam</a>, and it’s dominated online discussion as players celebrate the return of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remastereds-funny-character-faces-are-going-viral-for-being-total-nightmare-fuel-and-for-looking-like-the-original-fallout-talking-heads">funny character faces</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yes-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-still-has-all-the-bugs-glitches-and-memes-fans-know-and-love-from-20-years-ago">old bugs, and memes</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even other games Microsoft itself has pushed hard in marketing terms are running up against Oblivion Remastered. This week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-publisher-acknowledges-the-barbenheimer-energy-of-releasing-the-same-week-as-oblivion-remastered">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 publisher Kepler Interactive acknowledged the 'Barbenheimer' energy of releasing the same week as Oblivion Remastered</a>. Both games launched straight into Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Raw Fury, when it set the Post Trauma release date it couldn’t have known Oblivion Remastered was waiting to steal the show. It may gone down as just one of those things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got a comprehensive guide to everything you'll find in Oblivion Remastered, including an expansive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/cyrodiil">Interactive Map</a>, complete Walkthroughs for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Main_Quest_Walkthrough">Main Questline</a> and every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Guilds">Guild Quest</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Character_Building_Guide">How to Build the Perfect Character</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Things_to_Do_First_in_Oblivion">Things to Do First</a>, every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/PC_Cheats_and_Console_Commands">PC Cheat Code</a>, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
