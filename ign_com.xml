            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/deals-for-today-over-10-savings-on-pokmon-and-mtg-tcg-for-today-only<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/card-marketplace-tcgplayer-offering-store-credit-promotion-on-may-16">TCGplayer’s Mayhem Sale</a> is easily the best daily deal right now for both Pokémon TCG and Magic: The Gathering fans. For one day only on May 16, from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. ET, shoppers can earn 10 percent back in store credit on everything across the site. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes singles, sealed product, preorders, and supplies. Subscribers get an even better return with 12 percent back, plus any loyalty bonuses they've built up. With the Pokémon singles market currently going through a major correction, this is the ideal time to scoop up chase cards that have become far more affordable.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: TCG Player Mayhem Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy fans diving into Magic: The Gathering have even more reason to celebrate during TCGplayer’s Mayhem Sale. Preorders for the upcoming Final Fantasy crossover set are live now, and they’re all included in the 10 percent store credit promotion. That means if you're looking to lock in iconic characters like Tifa, Sephiroth, Cloud, or Y’shtola in premium foil treatments, you're not only getting ahead of release day scarcity but also stacking credit toward your next order. With singles like Tifa, Martial Artist (Borderless Surge Foil) at $450 or Cloud, Midgar Mercenary (Mythic Extended Art) at $125, the cashback can add up fast, earning you as much as $45 store credit from just one card.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">MTG Final Fantasy Single Cards</h3><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>For collectors chasing the Neon Ink variants, the value gets even better. Cards like Traveling Chocobo (Mythic Borderless Neon Ink Blue) and Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER (Extended Art) are already priced at a premium due to limited availability and collector demand. Getting 10 percent back on these high-end preorders is essentially a rebate on the kind of grail-tier singles that rarely see discounts. And because these cards won’t be widely available again once the initial wave sells out, now is the perfect time to secure them.</p><p>Even for buyers with more modest budgets, the Mayhem Sale applies to lower-cost preorders too. Whether it’s grabbing a Rare Cloud’s Limit Break for under $20 or a standard Sephiroth, Planet's Heir for less than $10, you’ll still get cashback toward future pickups. This makes it easier to build a full collection over time without blowing your budget all at once. And since TCGplayer supports hobby shops and small sellers, it’s a good way to invest in your collection while supporting the broader Magic community.</p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Destined Rivals Preorders</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG collectors have a lot to be excited about. Prices are dipping across the board, and the Mayhem Sale stacks real value on top. Cards like Greninja ex and Magikarp have seen huge drops, making them far more attainable. Journey Together is full of alternate rares and stamped promos that are now priced under ten dollars, and even premium pulls like Lillie’s Clefairy ex are well below the $150 mark.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Glory of Team Rocket</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Prismatic Evolutions is another standout, with high-end cards like Umbreon ex finally within reach. Getting $110 in store credit back on a single Umbreon purchase is the kind of value that doesn’t come around often.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Journey Together</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">With major price corrections in the Pokémon market and competitive cashback across the board, TCGplayer’s Mayhem Sale stands out as the best daily deal in the trading card space. It’s a rare chance to buy when prices are low and still earn credit toward your next round of pickups. If your collection has been on hold or your decks need tuning, this is the time to make it happen.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Prismatic Evolutions</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Surging Sparks</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Stellar Crown</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Shrouded Fable</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Twilight Masquerade</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Temporal Forces</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Paldean Fates</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Paradox Rift</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">151</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Obsidian Flames</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Scarlet and Violet</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Silver Tempest</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Lost Origin</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Fusion Strike</h3><p id="magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy">MTG Final Fantasy Starter Kit</h2></p><div catalogid="cfdff7da-51da-4bf2-8b73-9ca328f77d30" id="220727"><div id="220727" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy Starter Kit</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Preorder, releases June 13</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Arguably one of the most popular boxes, the FFVII-focused starter kit features Cloud and Sephiroth decks and it's just under $20.

We're seeing a predictable climb on Kefka, Court Mage #332, with a listing starting at $68.33 at the end of May  and peaking at $77.53. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It looks like it's going to settle at around the $76.02 judging off current listings, but this could rise further following the release window of MTG Final Fantasy.</p></div><p id="prismatic-evolutions-surprise-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Prismatic Evolutions Surprise Box">Prismatic Evolutions Surprise Box</h2></p><div catalogid="cfdff7da-51da-4bf2-8b73-9ca328f77d30" id="220665"><div id="220665" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Prismatic Evolutions Surprise Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This was nearly $90 earlier this week, and it's still at a ridiculous price.

Will it drop anymore? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Only time will tell, but it's on a steady downward trend, likely due to restocks and Journey Together pull rates being miles better than the likes of Prismatic Evolutions and the over saturation of Pokéball reverse holo cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for a steal? Articuno 161/159 has dropped by nearly over 50% since launch, finding its feet at a comfy $26.97 right now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/what-happens-when-a-game-developer-makes-a-walking-dead-game-in-fortnite-a-new-path-forward-for-game-studios<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Between layoffs, studio closures, and funding drying up, it’s fair to say that the games industry has been having a rough time. Enrique Fuentes, CEO and co-founder of Teravision games, experienced that turbulence much too closely for comfort when he and his team released Killer Klowns From Outer Space, an asymmetrical horror game based on the 80s movie of the same name. The game was well received (IGN gave it a 7, calling it “as silly and entertaining as the movie that spawned it.”) and trailers for the title racked up hundreds of thousands of views online. But the team found itself in a difficult spot after launch, the same difficult spot that many in the games industry found themselves in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As you know, 2024 was a pretty tough year for the whole industry. So it was a little bit slow for us to close our next project,” Fuentes says. Despite working with companies like Disney, Nickelodeon, and Xbox, Teravision was having difficulty finding a follow-up project to Killer Klowns. With time running out, the studio and its veteran developers with 20 years of experience in the industry looked towards something novel: making a game within Fortnite. In less than a year, Teravision has released three Unreal Engine for Fortnite (UEFN) games.  Its fourth game, launching today, takes advantage of the official The Walking Dead content pack released in UEFN.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/16/ck-twdu-screenshot-aereal-courtyard-1747427029518.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Made in partnership with Skybound, the company co-founded by The Walking Dead’s creator Robert Kirkman, Teravision’s newest UEFN game is a King of the Hill style multiplayer PvPvE project called Courtyard King, where players fight each other as well as NPC zombies for control of territory in The Walking Dead’s infamous prison location.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything The Walking Dead related in Courtyard King is made using official assets released for UEFN, including character models based on Rick Grimes, Negan, and Daryl Dixon. But the project goes further than just assets; Teravision worked with the writers at Skybound to craft the game’s story and dialogue. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Instead of a multi-year project like Killer Clowns From Outer Space, these are projects that we could put together in weeks or months.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have worked with big brands in the past… and UEFN was something that we were experimenting with… but we never imagined that was going to be the root where we’re going to be engaging with a company like Skybound,” Fuentes says. “But I mean, UGC, it’s one of the biggest things in gaming right now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">UGC, or user-generated content, is driving one of the biggest trends in gaming right now thanks to platforms like Fortnite. This kind of playground style game making has found massive audiences in services like Roblox already, but the ‘U’ in UGC typically refers to the end user, AKA players at home. UGC developed by professional studios is a newer concept, and Fortnite’s Unreal Engine 5-based tools were perfect for experienced devs like Teravision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It made sense because we come from an engineering background and it was a platform where we could experiment in and assume some of the risk,” explains Fuentes. “Because instead of a multi-year project like Killer Clowns From Outer Space, these are projects that we could put together in weeks or months.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Teravision’s experiments resulted in the launch of Havoc Hotel, a roguelike shooter where you fight through levels in a hotel, with each cleared floor earning you currency to purchase more powerful weapons. The first Havoc Hotel was a modest hit, enough to keep working on the series. Eventually we got to Havoc Hotel 3, which is now consistently one of Fortnite’s most popular games.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/16/ck-twdu-screenshot-coop-bat-1747427029518.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Teravision’s game designer, Martin Rodriguez, says given the studio previously made Killer Klowns in Unreal Engine, the jump to UEFN — a modified version of Unreal Engine 5 — was not only convenient, but gave the experienced devs a leg up when creating their games in UEFN. The systems are streamlined, and processes are a bit more “drag and drop,” as Rodriguez says. “For us, it just removes some of the work that we would’ve done otherwise and allows us to focus on just making better games and explore different new creative ideas."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"They’re weird situations and interactions that don’t necessarily translate into a very clear competition, but they still work.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the engineering side had no trouble adapting to UEFN’s Unreal-based tools, the game design team was presented with a unique challenge. Games like Havoc Hotel began as experiments as opposed to fully-fledged games, but quickly grew to become their own thing. And Teravision’s creative director, LD Zambrano, quickly learned that UEFN games were different from traditional games in many ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A traditional experience we have had designing other [non-UEFN] games is where players relate through objectives that entice cooperation and competition, right?” Zambrano says. “In [UEFN’s] case, we have found that even though those objectives are still relevant and we still can use that game design sensibility and bring them there, I found that there are a lot of experiences that are very popular within the Fortnite ecosystem that are kind of just context. They’re weird situations and interactions that don’t necessarily translate into a very clear competition, but they still work.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zambrano compares UEFN games to  the school yard. “I have found that there is this way of approaching each other that brings me back to recess, which is you meet somebody and make up some sort of game that might not make sense, but still you’re engaging and creating friendships. That’s what I mean about some of these games becoming a ‘context.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In that way, one unique thing I learned about Courtyard King from Teravision is that it is an infinite game, meaning there is no final winner at the end of a round. Instead, matches continue forever with players jumping in and out, switching teams. And while there will always be a team that is winning, there will never be a final round where a true winner is crowned. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/16/ck-twdu-screenshot-red-hallway-1747427029518.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“Players can drop in and drop out whenever they want. They can even change teams whenever they like, which generates situations for betrayals. Maybe you enter a party with your friend, but then in the middle of the match you don’t tell him and change teams. Which is very Walking Dead-like.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"This is now a viable model where you can actually support an 80 person studio like we do, and we can assume the risk” </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this a future for game developers? On the one hand, it puts them in the sandbox of other, bigger players like Epic Games or Roblox. But for studios looking to experiment without burning through their entire funds, while having access to a large player base and big IP assets like The Walking Dead, Enrique Fuentes says there’s a lot of upside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can actually assume the risk as an indie developer in [UEFN]. Because last year, we couldn’t even think about starting a three-year project. We could do something in a few weeks with a smaller team and that completely changes the paradigm for a new developer. This is now a viable model where you can actually support an 80 person studio like we do, and we can assume the risk,” Fuentes says. “It’s something that if you have the right ideas, the right creativity around it, if you understand the market well enough and you have the right thinking, execution becomes possible and it doesn’t take years, it actually takes weeks, maybe months. I think this is a dream come true for indie developers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-spoiler-amano-matsuda<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Popular commanders are getting classic Amano art reprints.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">pre-orders</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mtg-final-fantasy-starter-kit-preorder-where-to-buy-in-stock-amazon">sell out</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-commander-decks-are-packed-with-fun-surprising-references">tons of references are revealed</a>, Magic: The Gathering's upcoming crossover with Final Fantasy is shaping up to be its biggest ever. Today, we get to add to that fun with six cards that are available in the upcoming set: three featuring classic concept art by Yoshitaka Amano, and three with more recent art by Toshitaka Matsuda.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flip through the gallery below to see all six cards</strong>, and read on to learn where to find them yourself:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering x Final Fantasy - 6 Through the Ages Cards</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The cards we are revealing today are part of the "Through the Ages" bonus sheet that is within the larger main set. That means they are all reprints of existing cards reskinned with concept art and characters from different Final Fantasy games - so while there are no brand new or mechanically unique cards here like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-your-first-look-at-over-a-dozen-new-cards-from-magic-the-gatherings-upcoming-final-fantasy-set">the ones that have been shown off recently</a> or those in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers">the Commander decks we previously revealed</a>, they do have art that stretches back all the way to the very first game in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the cards in the main set, Through the Ages cards do not become legal in Magic's Standard format (though they still are if the existing card was already legal there, of course), essentially just making them alternate art versions of those cards. That said, they can be found in both the fancier Collector Boosters as well as one in every three of the regular Play Boosters that are used for Limited events like Draft and Sealed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That means if you plan to play a lot of this set either at your local game store or digitally on something like Magic: The Gathering Arena, you are likely to see these cards in action quite frequently. Five of the six cards here are Rares, which means they won't show up as often, but Thrum of the Vestige is notably an Uncommon. That's a reskin for one of Magic's most ubiquitous cards, Lightning Bolt, and I wouldn't be surprised if this particular printing has quite the impact on the set.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Warrior of Light reprinting of Jodah, the Unifier is also certain to be a popular one - Jodah is a powerful and common Commander, and the art used here is Amano's from the Japanese boxart of the original Final Fantasy. Similarly, Amano's iconic art for Final Fantasy 4's Cecil Harvey has been repurposed for one of Magic's strongest partner commanders, Tymna the Weaver, which has only ever been reprinted once before this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These cards launch physically as part of the larger Final Fantasy set on June 13, with the digital versions going live on MTG Arena and MTGO on June 10. And if you are a Final Fantasy fan who isn't into Magic yet, there is still reason to be excited, as FF7 Remake series director Tetsuya Nomura said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-reason-why-sephiroth-has-a-different-design-in-the-magic-the-gathering-set-but-director-tetsuya-nomura-cant-share-more-sparking-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-speculation">the design of Sephiroth on one card is different for some cryptic reason</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.
