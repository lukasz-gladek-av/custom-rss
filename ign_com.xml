The sequel game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, is set to arrive in June and the franchise’s star, actor Norman Reedus, recently teased some of the game — as well as a key tidbit about the future film adaptation — in an interview with IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If it was an option, yeah, for sure,” Reedus revealed when asked if he would consider playing himself in a future film version of the game which was announced to be in the works from Michael Sarnoski and A24 last month. “I don’t know what’s happening with it. It’s so pre pre pre right now. But yeah, of course.”</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@ign/video/7504856402859527470" data-video-id="7504856402859527470"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ign?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="@ign" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ign</a> Norman Reedus teases Death Stranding 2 while promoting From the World of John Wick: Ballerina! <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/deathstranding?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="deathstranding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#deathstranding</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/normanreedus?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="normanreedus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#normanreedus</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/ballerina?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="ballerina" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ballerina</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/johnwick?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="johnwick" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#johnwick</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/interview?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#interview</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7504856455565134635?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - IGN Entertainment" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ original sound - IGN Entertainment</a> </section> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">We also asked Reedus about his confusion with the first game and if he still felt that way going into the second one, but it seems he deeply trusts <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-talks-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-im-just-really-happy-we-can-finish-making-the-game">creator Hideo Kojima</a>, whose reputation obviously precedes him. “As far as working with him and understanding where his head’s at, I don’t think anybody can understand where his head’s at,” the Walking Dead alum explained. “He’s just that guy, he’s out there and he’s got great ideas. But story-wise, I did know what was happening more. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-played-30-hours-of-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">There’s more action in it, there’s more of a definite goal to get to</a>.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, no matter what’s going on in the Death Stranding world, Reedus is happily along for the ride. “It’s always a trip working on those things,” he told IGN. “It’s great, but it’s wild.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-reveals-exactly-why-death-stranding-2-is-launching-in-june-instead-of-september">will be released</a> on June 26, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lex Briscuso is a film and television critic and a freelance entertainment writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-spoiler-amano-matsuda<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Popular commanders are getting classic Amano art reprints.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">pre-orders</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mtg-final-fantasy-starter-kit-preorder-where-to-buy-in-stock-amazon">sell out</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-commander-decks-are-packed-with-fun-surprising-references">tons of references are revealed</a>, Magic: The Gathering's upcoming crossover with Final Fantasy is shaping up to be its biggest ever. Today, we get to add to that fun with six cards that are available in the upcoming set: three featuring classic concept art by Yoshitaka Amano, and three with more recent art by Toshitaka Matsuda.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flip through the gallery below to see all six cards</strong>, and read on to learn where to find them yourself:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering x Final Fantasy - 6 Through the Ages Cards</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The cards we are revealing today are part of the "Through the Ages" bonus sheet that is within the larger main set. That means they are all reprints of existing cards reskinned with concept art and characters from different Final Fantasy games - so while there are no brand new or mechanically unique cards here like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-your-first-look-at-over-a-dozen-new-cards-from-magic-the-gatherings-upcoming-final-fantasy-set">the ones that have been shown off recently</a> or those in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers">the Commander decks we previously revealed</a>, they do have art that stretches back all the way to the very first game in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the cards in the main set, Through the Ages cards do not become legal in Magic's Standard format (though they still are if the existing card was already legal there, of course), essentially just making them alternate art versions of those cards. That said, they can be found in both the fancier Collector Boosters as well as one in every three of the regular Play Boosters that are used for Limited events like Draft and Sealed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That means if you plan to play a lot of this set either at your local game store or digitally on something like Magic: The Gathering Arena, you are likely to see these cards in action quite frequently. Five of the six cards here are Rares, which means they won't show up as often, but Thrum of the Vestige is notably an Uncommon. That's a reskin for one of Magic's most ubiquitous cards, Lightning Bolt, and I wouldn't be surprised if this particular printing has quite the impact on the set.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Warrior of Light reprinting of Jodah, the Unifier is also certain to be a popular one - Jodah is a powerful and common Commander, and the art used here is Amano's from the Japanese boxart of the original Final Fantasy. Similarly, Amano's iconic art for Final Fantasy 4's Cecil Harvey has been repurposed for one of Magic's strongest partner commanders, Tymna the Weaver, which has only ever been reprinted once before this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These cards launch physically as part of the larger Final Fantasy set on June 13, with the digital versions going live on MTG Arena and MTGO on June 10. And if you are a Final Fantasy fan who isn't into Magic yet, there is still reason to be excited, as FF7 Remake series director Tetsuya Nomura said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-reason-why-sephiroth-has-a-different-design-in-the-magic-the-gathering-set-but-director-tetsuya-nomura-cant-share-more-sparking-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-speculation">the design of Sephiroth on one card is different for some cryptic reason</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor. He loves cards games, puzzles, platformers, puzzle-platformers, and lots more.</em></p></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 16, 2025 4:00 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
