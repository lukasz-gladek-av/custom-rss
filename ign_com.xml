            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/romeo-is-a-dead-man-brings-gameplay-maturity-to-suda51s-signature-madness</link>
            <guid>1398385</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">You can’t always describe Goichi Suda and Grasshopper Manufacture’s games, but you know them when you see them. Examples like Let It Die and Lollipop Chainsaw might not resemble each other on paper, but spend any length of time with them and their specific high energy, off-the-wall style, brash tone, and script that's just wall-to-wall one-liners and you'll see that could really only ever come from one place. Just a few minutes with their latest slasher, Romeo Is a Dead Man, and yeah the boys are definitely back in town. But after playing the first two chapters, the latest mad science experiment of an action game helmed by Suda51, it clearly takes some big steps forward in art design and presentation that really raises the “Wow I didn’t see that coming” bar. Even the action, though not revolutionary, feels like a real commitment has been made to evolve the studio’s image from “crazy fun games to watch clips from” to “crazy fun games to spend countless hours with.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a lot of Grasshopper-style things that are to be expected in Romeo Is a Dead Man: relentless absurdist humor, gore galore, killing the past, etc. But the signature erratic tone set as far back as Killer7 feels turned up to 11 here. The breakneck pace at which exposition gets sort of vomited at you, scenes change from focused narration to chaotic combat, and more is pretty intense. It’s not necessarily hard to follow, but more than once in my two or so hours with the game did I have to take a minute or two to simply digest what the hell was going on.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Romeo Is a Dead Man - January 2026 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as the titular Romeo, who does have himself a Juliet, but the only way this game showed any resemblance to your favorite play from high school is that both of them die. Romeo is a deputy sheriff who gets his face ripped off by an interdimensional zombie ghoul and is transformed into a sort of Space Sheriff Gavan-style superhero that keeps him in a state of undeath and is drafted in to a sort of space time division of the FBI to hunt the sort of monsters that tried to kill him. Juliet, who arrived in Romeo’s little Appalachian town through mysterious circumstances, is actually some kind of extradimensional being who seems to keep popping up in people’s dimensions and mucking up the place, and is one of Romeo’s first targets. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Romeo Is a Dead Man’s story might be among the most ridiculous and far flung of Suda and Co.’s gameography, but it holds tightly to its fourth wall-breaking sense of humor and over the top characters that define the studio.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the simple version, completely glossing over things like the fact that the guy who saved Romeo is allegedly his time-traveling grandfather – who is also killed by face eaters but now just lives in a patch on Romeo’s jacket, for starters. Romeo Is a Dead Man’s story might be among the most ridiculous and far flung of Suda and Co.’s gameography, but it holds tightly to its fourth wall-breaking sense of humor and over the top characters that define the studio. It’s relatively easy to follow, and told in such a way to purposefully cast doubt on if what you’re attempting to decipher is even real. But it is engaging, if not always well-written or acted. And even then, it's told through a collage of mixed media that really kept me enthralled.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The opening sequence is a flyover of a tilt-shifted, handmade diorama. From there, we transition into a standard cutscene rendered in full 3D as one would expect, and the next scene might be a vividly detailed comic strip. Inside levels, small televisions appear with pixelated animations on them that serve as portals transporting you to spaces that look more like the Street Fighter training room with a stock jungle image in the background. When teleporting to your FBI HQ – a ship called The Last Night – you navigate it like a top-down 32-bit Sega Genesis-style RPG. When you die, the “game over” screen is an FMV of a human-like prosthetic face getting melted off. It’s all jarring, and frankly, pretty awesome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grasshopper games have a bit of a reputation for having stories and presentation given texture through tons of references to pop culture, classic literature, and raucous music, but not having the same sort of depth when it comes time to beat ass, the misunderstood Killer Is Dead excluded. Romeo Is a Dead Man isn’t Devil May Cry, but it has a lot of layered systems that create a combat experience that I really came to like quite a bit. You have basic light and heavy attacks with their own attack strings that can be stopped early but not canceled out with a dodge or something like that, so every swing is a commitment. When surrounded by enemies, even the simple cannon fodder basic zombies, it can be tough to make it out unscathed since these attacks don't stun enemies very reliably, meaning they're often free to slap as you slap them. I spent a lot of my time trying to stay outside of mobs, picking away at the edges with melee attacks or shots with guns at range and avoiding getting overwhelmed until I built enough of my blood meter through my attacks to use a special Bloody Summer attack for big damage.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This pretty simple loop was a bit of a let down for me early on, as Chapter 1 lacked attack and enemy variety, or really any challenge or pushback at all. And if I would have stopped my time after slaying the pretty straightforward end-level boss, a towering giant spawned after a Juliet clone ripped off her own head and threw it into a campfire, I would have missed the metric ton of new stuff that drops right after that gives Romeo so many more toys to work with.  After flying back to HQ to report a job well done, I could buy more and different weapons – all which add their own sort of approach to regular combat – and could be swapped between in the field. I don’t think the melee weapons forced me to change my playstyle in the way a heavy greatsword, set of robot gauntlets, and spear that split into dual blades should, but the ranged weapons did. The pistol, shotgun, rocket launcher, and machine gun all forced me to work around their strengths way differently, if I was going to choose to lean on them.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Romeo is a Dead Man’s weirdest and best feature, though, are bastards – zombies that you can grow like plants that have special abilities that you can equip to use in battle.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Romeo is a Dead Man’s weirdest and best feature, though, are bastards – zombies that you can grow like plants that have special abilities that you can equip to use in battle, like one that spits poison or one that blows itself up on enemies. This gives you so many more ways to control crowds and keep your offense effective against a cohort of bad guys that also grow more deadly. Basic foes with guns (at least on the 3 out of 4 difficulty I was playing on) provided a significant jump in danger when they repeatedly shot at me while being tucked behind hordes of zombies. Mix that with the spicier sort of mutants that ram you with their giant tomato heads or scorpion-shaped bomb lobbers that leave toxic trails, and any given scenario could become a death trap. Even the second boss, a giant mutant head you fight between two floors of a mall food court, is a huge step up in quality from the first.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Romeo Is a Dead Man - Reveal Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a pretty old-school action game. There aren’t a lot of nuanced mechanics like dodges cancels. There's not even a parry or a block – at least in the beginning. But I enjoyed the relatively simple push and pull of each stage with the systems that exist quite a lot, even if the camera became a monster on its own. With everything properly in frame things still get very busy on screen very quickly, mostly due to the truly egregious levels of blood and particle effects that come off of enemies as you slash them up. Mix that with the text bubbles that pop up from characters trying to give you some unvoiced dialogue usually fight in the middle of combat and it can be hard to focus on the task at hand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes despite itself, Romeo Is a Dead Man is shaping up to be a frantic action romp worthy of the Grasshopper Manufacture pedigree. Its somewhat traditional action mechanics don’t really test your reflexes and make an underwhelming first impression, but does pay off patience when rewarding good positioning and smart use of your bastard skills to get a leg up on the more eccentric enemies past the first chapter. It’s crazy throughout, using strong humor and marvelous art direction at a breakneck speed to make its truly bonkers space-traveling love story one worth patiently waiting until February 16 for.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/romeo-is-a-dead-man-brings-gameplay-maturity-to-suda51s-signature-madness]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1398382</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The screen they play on may be small, but for competitors in the 2025 PUBG MOBILE Global Championship (PMGC), the tournament is anything but. Between 12-14 December, 16 teams from all around the world gathered in Thailand to give it their all on a giant stage in front of a legion of cheering fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This major global competition is the conclusion of more than a year of training and face-offs for these professional teams, all leading towards the prestigious event in the circuit. In qualifying for this ultimate trial, teams went head-to-head once more to take the 2025 PMGC title and the lion’s share of $3m — one of the largest prize pools in esports.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that wasn’t all, the tournament expanded beyond the venue’s walls, with PUBG MOBILE activations popping up around Bangkok. IGN was on the ground to witness the grand finals, soak up the festival-like atmosphere, and learn more about how PUBG MOBILE Esports is growing in 2026.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/05/bambam-4-1767612303389.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Thai singer Bam Bam performed in the opening ceremony </figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>DROPPING INTO BANGKOK</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Grand Finals of 2025 PMGC may have taken place on the 5th floor of the luxurious Siam Paragon shopping mall, but the celebrations extended far and wide. Both inside and outside the venue, PUBG MOBILE pop-ups, collaborations, and installations brought a vibrant energy to proceedings, providing fans and players who travelled from across the globe with unique experiences, in addition to the spectacle of the Grand Finals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On our first day, after entering past the plane-themed check-in desk, we found ourselves in the PUBG United Fan Zone, an area seemingly filled with as many activities as there were attendees. This marked a pivotal moment for PUBG MOBILE, as it collaborated with PUBG for the first time ever to celebrate a long-standing history of competition and sportsmanship conveyed through the 2025 PMGC and PUBG Global Championship 2025 (PGC). This certainly showed, as lining the walls of the Fan Zone were interactive experiences ranging from a human claw machine, glambot, PUBG café, Frosty Barbershop (where I got a PUBG MOBILE-themed temporary tattoo), Metro Royale battle experience, and a World of Wonder Challenge area where players could get hands on with curated UGC experiences.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">PUBG United Fanzone</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the centre of the Fan Zone, the PUBG MOBILE Air Drop Stage hosted multiple performances from bands (Thai artists Paper Planes were a particular highlight, getting the crowd jumping and singing along with their pop-punk anthems), as well as several Muay Thai fights – truly ‘kicking’ things off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the opening ceremony and 2026 PUBG MOBILE Esports announcements (more on that later), we swung by the PDP Creative Zone, home to a colossal PUBG MOBILE helmet that had been decorated by selected PDP artists and designers during the event. As if that wasn’t enough, the approach to the stage also featured pop-ups collaborations with Porsche and Thai bakery brand famous for its adorable mascot character, Butterbear.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/05/butterbear-1-1767612397373.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Butterbear mascot on stage with James Yang, Senior Director of Global esports at Level Infinite</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that was just a selection of what was going on in the venue! Once the first matches of the Grand Finals were finished, it was time for Bangkok to show that PUBG United had arrived in the city. After a quick trip to the Chao Phraya River in a PUBG MOBILE branded Tuk Tuk, we witnessed the PUBG MOBILE drone light show featuring hundreds of drones lighting up the sky. These formed iconic PUBG MOBILE imagery, including ‘Winner Winner Chicken Dinner’, characters dropping into the map, and appropriately, Air Drop crates. Plus, if you kept an eye out on the Chao Phraya River, you could even see the PUBG MOBILE Giant Boat making a splash.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/06/drone-show-1767690333375.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Drone show lit up the sky by the Chao Phraya River</figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>ONE WORLD, TWO CHAMPIONS</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned, for the first time ever, both the PUBG MOBILE and PUBG Global Championships came together for a unified global event – PUBG United – a celebration of both games and their communities. The sense of two giants coming together was felt, and illustrated, by the two giant back-to-back stages that hosted the Grand Finals, with gameplay and crucial team standings displayed on the wall-to-wall screens, giving attendees a great view of the action wherever they were sat.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/05/fmvp-1767612595763.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Alpha Gaming player Top was crowned MVP for the PMGC 2025</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of giants, PUBG MOBILE’s collaboration with luxury brands took a big step up this year. Building on a successful collaboration campaign between Porsche and PUBG MOBILE, it was announced that Porsche would invigorate the PMGC stage with the prize of a Porsche Cayenne to the MVP player of the 2025 PMGC Grand Finals. For 2025 PMGC MVP ‘TOP’, from team Alpha Gaming, it's likely this softened the blow of coming third place overall.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">PMGC Winners - Alpha 7 </h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For the winners however, another collaboration offered up its own prize, as the collaboration between PUBG MOBILE and renowned luxury fashion house Balenciaga saw the two brands converge their unique identities again, this time with an exclusive designed jacket that only the Champions of the 2025 PUBG MOBILE Global Championship had the honour of wearing and owning. With this, in addition to the glory of being crowned 2025 PMGC Champions and lifting the trophy, team Alpha 7 esports were adorned with exclusive 2025 PMGC Champion jackets.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>MOBILE GROWTH</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With more than 1 billion downloads around the world, and over 50 million daily active users, PUBG MOBILE is one of the most popular mobile games in the world – so it tracks that the game’s esports scene is also hugely popular, and continues to grow. With more than 1 billion downloads around the world, and over 50 million daily active users, PUBG MOBILE is one of the most popular mobile games in the world – so it tracks that the game’s esports scene is also hugely popular, and continues to grow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This growth and success was exemplified by PUBG MOBILE being awarded Mobile Esports of the Year at the Esports Awards for the second time. It’s no surprise then that at this year’s PMGC, PUBG MOBILE recorded its highest peak viewership in five years, with more than 1.3 million concurrent viewers watching the Grand Finals across the globe. This peak was reached between matches 16-18, in the last few pivotal moments of the competition which saw Alpha 7, ULF Esports, and Alpha Gaming battle it out for the title which was well within reach of all three teams.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things for PUBG MOBILE are only set to get even better, and as the new year approaches, a new season of PUBG MOBILE esports events begins, and as was announced by James Yang, Senior Director of Global esports at Level Infinite, the PUBG MOBILE Esports calendar is looking even busier in 2026…</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>WHAT’S NEXT FOR PUBG MOBILE ESPORTS IN 2026</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Building on 2025’s PUBG MOBILE’s esports experience, which featured over one-million players from over 180 countries and regions, Yang unveiled a series of updates regarding the future of PUBG MOBILE Esports, including a refreshed competitive structure and a doubling down on support for grassroots and amateur level esports.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest shake up coming in 2026 is that instead of following the previous Super League structure, there will be two PMGO tournaments spread across two seasons, expanding qualification routes and increasing the number of opportunities for players of all levels to compete at the top. As usual, both these PMGOs will be open to amateur and professional teams, allowing more fans to compete at the top of their game and earn rewards.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/18/pubgm-2026-roadmap-3-1766076940753.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The PUBG MOBILE esports official tournament roadmap</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first stage in this format will see more than 30 PUBG MOBILE National Championships taking place across eight regions globally. These will feed into regional qualifiers, determining which teams advance. The 2026 PMGO Season 1 will take place in South East Asia with a share of $500,000 USD on offer, while the second season will be held for the first time in Pakistan with the same prize pool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The teams who accumulate the most points across the two seasons will earn their spot at the 2026 PMGC, which returns to Turkiye after its previous appearance there back in 2023, set to deliver the biggest PMGC tournament to date, with another hefty $3m prize pool up for grabs.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/18/pubgm-2026-roadmap-8-1766076788858.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">PMGC 2026 returns to Türkiye</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Before that is the return of the PUBG MOBILE World Cup (PMWC) as part of the Esports World Cup for the third year running. Held in Riyadh, next year’s tournament looks to further the esports mobile game of the year’s global presence and growing audience, and solidify PUBG MOBILE’s position as an esports leader.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside these major changes to the annual format, players can also expect integration across the board that aims to fulfil many of the same goals of making esports more accessible for everyone, everywhere. Firstly, it will be easier than ever for organisers to create their own competitions, as the registration process for third-parties has been streamlined, and for competitors across the globe, the enhancement of the in-game participation system means they’ll be able to join an esports tournament with just a few clicks.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">GET INVOLVED</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Bangkok closed out the year with another successful PMGC. PUBG United celebrated everything fans love about the game, with activations and pop-ups sustaining buzz surrounding the main event of the Grand Finals. As players and fans gear up for 2026, new opportunities to compete present themselves, will you be taking part?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Download</em><em><strong> PUBG MOBILE</strong></em><em> for free via the </em><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pubg-mobile/id1330123889" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><em>App Store</em></u></a><em> and </em><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tencent.ig" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><em>Google Play Store</em></u></a><em>.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-pubg-mobile-esports-3m-global-championship-took-over-bangkok-and-whats-next-in-2026]]></content:encoded>
