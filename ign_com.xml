It was the fastest-selling expansion in Magic: The Gathering history, per Hasbro. Its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-secret-lair">Secret Lair collaboration drops sold out in record time</a>, and while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-where-to-buy-in-stock">stocks of the boosters, starter kits, and decks have improved</a>, there was a period there where it was difficult to get your hands on anything Magic x Final Fantasy-related. The set's popularity even pushed a bunch of non-Final Fantasy cards to higher prices, just <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-cards-spike-thanks-to-new-final-fantasy-synergies">because of their excellent synergy with the set</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And on top of all that, it apparently earned $200 million in a single day - the same amount that Magic's Lord of the Rings set earned in <em>six months.</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Hasbro in its Q2 earnings call</a>, which revealed the figure alongside a report that Magic: The Gathering revenue grew 23% year-over-year in large part thanks to the Final Fantasy release.  Per CEO Chris Cox, it brought in more new players in stores over two weeks than any other set has in 12 weeks. And in the investor Q&amp;A during the earnings call, Cox answered a question about how Final Fantasy's demand correlated to the company's expectations with the following quote (<a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-hasbro-beats-q2-2025-estimates-but-stock-dips-93CH-4148568" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">courtesy of Investing.com's transcript</a>):</p><blockquote>In terms of Final Fantasy and how it met expectations, I’ll give you a comparison between two of our biggest universe at the onsets. Lord of the Rings took six months to deliver $200,000,000 of revenue.</blockquote><blockquote>Final Fantasy took one day. And we left demand on the table. So we couldn’t produce enough. I think we increased production runs on it four times pre release. It was substantially, by many, many very high double digit percentages, ahead of any other production run we’ve ever done.</blockquote><blockquote>And we left the market wanting more. And our expectation is there’s going to be a nice long tail of backlist for the product. Likewise, we’re still selling Lord of the Rings product today. So, even though we hit $200,000,000 in December ’2 for Lord of the Rings, We sold a substantial percentage of that in the several years following. We expect Final Fantasy to be no different.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s partially what’s powering our backlist, which already in five and a half months in the year did more than we’ve ever done in any year prior. So, I think that’s a little bit on what our bullishness is on Final Fantasy. What drove success for it? I think it’s a couple of things. I think first and foremost, it’s finding the right IPs that are great adjacencies to what Magic fans might appeal to or what Magic might appeal to another fan base.</blockquote><blockquote>Lord of the Rings was fantastic because it’s kind of the granddaddy of fantasy. It invented the genre, major books, major movies, major animation and games. Final Fantasy, I think, is almost as strong as Lord of the Rings in terms of IP strength, if not stronger in some regions. I think it has stronger cross regional appeal, and it has probably more of a sweet spot in gaming than Lord of the Rings has, because it was kind of born from gaming. So, I think potentially the overlap of fan bases was stronger than you might have even seen for something like Lord of the Rings.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In a follow-up question, Cox also noted that he feels "pretty good" about future collaborations and first-party sets coming next year "in terms of being Final Fantasy like in terms of the types of players, the size of community, and the adjacencies we have." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last remark bodes well for fans of the Final Fantasy set. We just saw a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-magic-the-gathering-crossover-spoilers-secret-lair">Sonic: The Hedgehog Secret Lair crossover</a> debut, and already know about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-magic-the-gathering-crossover-reveal-card-spoilers">Spider-Man</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-aang-magic-the-gathering-cards-reveal-early-look-at-upcoming-the-last-airbender-set">Avatar: The Last Airbender themed sets in September</a> and November, respectively, so with success like this, more crossovers are likely to make sense to the folks at Hasbro. In the meantime, at least this means Hasbro will keep the Final Fantasy cards stocked for a good while, for those who haven't been able to get their hands on them yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-corps-of-discovery-board-game-is-a-challenging-trek-through-the-american-wilderness.1251453/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">“Here be monsters,” says the legend on so many antique maps, firing the imagination with thoughts of kraken, chimeras, or worse. But what if it were true? What if Lewis and Clarke, setting out on their expedition across the American interior, encountered buffalo-headed minotaurs and man-eating plants. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the premise of the Corps of Discovery comic and now of this board game adaptation. The game comes from the same designers as the superb <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mind-mgmt-board-game-review"><u>Mind MGMT</u></a>, although, save for the comic book connection, this is a very different kind of game.</p><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box">What’s in the Box</h2></p><div catalogid="a6a6c32d-c46f-44a3-834e-97a927e776f1" id="225555"><div id="225555" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Corps of Discovery</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Most box-openings start with a board, and Corps of Discovery is no exception, but the nature of the board itself is rather surprising. Instead of the usual fold-out affair, you get a cardboard sandwich: two layers of card stuck together, with room in between to slip in a sheet of paper. The top layer is punctuated by a regular grid of circular holes, and the box contains an equally unusual supply of thick cardboard sun tokens with wide “pegs” that fit loosely into the grid's holes.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250628-145130883-1753125741072.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two folders of paper maps that slide into the sandwich, one for each of the two scenarios included in the game. There’s also a second board which is used for tracking the current game state, with spaces for three challenge cards, backpack items and water: this doubles as a handy reminder of the flow of each game day. There are tokens for the various resources that go in your backpack and for your water supply. There are also several card decks, not only the challenge cards that’ll outline the obstacles you must overcome each day, but also characters to play, items for them to use and so on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a scenario-based game, there are also additional cards and tokens applicable to particular scenarios. One thing to note is that, as a game based on a comic book series, all the components are furnished with excellent art from the original comics. While it might not be to everyone’s tastes, it does a fantastic job of bringing the game’s dangerous world to life, especially if you’re familiar with the source material.</p></div><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How It Plays</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250707-191631962-mp-1753126200486.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Understanding how the game is set up is, unusually, an integral part of understanding how it plays. First, your group chooses one of the two scenarios to play (plus a training mission), and one of the 10 map sheets included for that scenario, covering it with a blank sheet so you can’t see what’s on it. You slip this, cover and all, into the cardboard-sandwich board then cover all the holes with the sun tokens. Then you slip out the blank sheet. The result is a game map that you know nothing about, ripe for exploration and discovery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games"><u>cooperative game</u></a> where you’re working together to map the wilderness and survive. On your individual turn, you simply remove a sun token, revealing an icon underneath, and take a matching resource to add to your collective backpack. There’s no piece to mark where you are on the map. Instead, movement is abstracted away under the presumption that it’s easy to move through already explored territory. The next player just removes a sun token next to any already-revealed space, although there are some mountainous areas on each map that you can’t traverse.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250707-191556654-1753126158243.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploration, however, is far from a random walk in the park. Each scenario has a set of rules about where and how the various different icons are laid out. In the Fauna scenario, for example, there’s always one wood icon per row and column, and there will always be a water icon orthogonally adjacent to each wood. Each mud icon will be next to a water and a stone, while forts always form an L-shape series with a water and a skull. There are more rules – and icons – but you get the idea.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This allows you to make predictions and deductions about what you’re going to encounter on the map. Sometimes you can figure it out with complete certainty, but more often it’s a bit of a gamble, where you can narrow down the odds without being sure. Exploration is thus both a fun puzzle where you can aim for specific resources, and an exercise loaded with tension. The rules are complex enough to make it a good group discussion, ensuring there’s a dynamic sense of cooperation, and something you can master with practice. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The rules are complex enough to make it a good group discussion, ensuring there’s a dynamic sense of cooperation, and something you can master with practice.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each time you remove a sun token from the board you place it on one of three challenge cards dealt at the start of the game day. These cards have a resource requirement that you must spend in order to pass the challenge and a consequence for passing or failing, the latter of which usually means losing even more, different resources. You have to face these consequences once the card accumulates a certain number of suns, often only two or three. Considering many challenges require more than two or three resources to pass, this immediately puts your game under massive pressure to find the right icons on every turn.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250707-190121214-1753125922112.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you run out of water tokens, you die. If you end the day – timing out the three challenge cards for that die – without any food tokens, you die. Monsters generally don’t kill you outright but sap these precious, precious resource tokens until you die. Even when you’re on top of the resource-mapping system, most games will go down to the wire of you gaining your objective with a few measly drops of water left in your canteen. The last few turns ramp up the tension to crushing levels, until it almost feels like you’re struggling through a real wilderness, desperately following signs of water in the hope of surviving just one more day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As if this wasn’t enough, on top of surviving you also have a goal to complete. This depends on the scenario. In Fauna, for instance, you’ll meet those buffalo-headed minotaurs who’ll make it harder to traverse rows and columns until you find a fort, learn a recipe for killing one, and sacrifice the necessary resources, all of which you were probably hoping to save to pass a challenge card. These kinds of trade-offs are part of the game’s strategy: identifying times when failing a daily challenge can be a useful step in the wider goal of passing the winning objectives.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250628-145141636-1753125839302.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other aspects of your decision-making come down to the characters in play and the gear you choose at the outset, all of which offer you special abilities to piece together and increase your chance of survival. You can plan ahead with these since you pick them yourself, look for combos, and build a strategy around them. But there are also destiny cards, random helpful bonuses that you can sometimes replenish by achieving in-game goals, and for these you’ll have to roll with whatever fate gives you, adjusting your tactics accordingly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With practice and luck you will, eventually, manage to beat Fauna and, in time, the game’s second scenario, Flora, which involves a giant carnivorous plant. Corps of Discovery goes out of its way to make these scenarios replayable by offering such a huge range of map sheets – you can also download and print out more – that memorising the layouts is essentially impossible. Variety, however, cannot fully undermine human psychology: there’s an innate tendency to treat a mission as “done” once it’s been won. This is exacerbated by the game’s high difficulty level and lack of narrative detail. Although it does a great job of conjuring up the spectre of starving in the wilderness, the challenge cards feel pretty mechanical, so repeated tries at a scenario can feel a little same-y.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250707-191508329-1753126054718.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t quite the limiting factor it may sound like as it’ll take you repeated attempts to win both the scenarios, and there are expansions available which further the story and build considerably on the core mechanics – all four are included in the deluxe edition, which we used for the photos accompanying this review. But it still would have felt like a more complete experience if more of these elements had been included in the base game. As it stands, the game’s high toughness is the major motivation for a replay, and it’s almost enough by itself: winning against the odds, in a land where almost everything you encounter is out to kill you, is a hugely satisfying moment.</p><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBgxA8?object_uuid=efb277a0-a370-437f-878b-a449b5653b6a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8e8O?object_uuid=efb277a0-a370-437f-878b-a449b5653b6a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Miniature Market</a></li></ul></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 23, 2025 5:36 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Corps of Discovery’s core concept of exploring and surviving in unknown, hostile terrain is a strong one, and it’s well executed with some novel mechanical ideas. Each play feels like a gruelling crawl across the wilderness, just as it should, and it feels very rewarding when you manage to eke out a win. As strong as this central pillar is, however, the core of the game lacks much in the way of support from narrative, player interaction, or variety, particularly given the sparse supply of different scenarios to play, so it might not return to your table as often as it should.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-corps-of-discovery-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

It costs 7 to Station and is a 5/5 in its own right (with Flying).</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Esika’s Chariot</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225657"><div id="225657" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Esika’s Chariot</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One for the cat lovers, <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxlZ4?object_uuid=75ca9cc3-68af-413b-8e65-01127207d870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Esika’s Chariot</u></a> is a four-cost 4/4 that requires 4 to Crew, but can create tokens when it arrives, and then copy additional tokens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tie it in with Doubling Season and your go-wide strategy can be, uh, wider than ever, creating four tokens when it enters, and then duplicating more when it attacks. More kitties, more chaos.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Entropic Battlecruiser</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225658"><div id="225658" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Entropic Battlecruiser</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh boy, where to start? Stick a single creature in the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7dbv?object_uuid=75ca9cc3-68af-413b-8e65-01127207d870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Entropic Battlecruiser</u></a> and your foes will be pinged for 3 life when discarding, but keep ramping up the Station and you’ll give it a huge health pool, flying, deathtouch, and force discards all around the table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will your opponents take it out before it gets there? Potentially, but we reckon it’s worth it for those people who love to mess with their opponents’ hands.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Exploration Broodship</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225659"><div id="225659" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Exploration Broodship</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve been looking for a fresh Landfall Commander, this could be it. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjprJq?object_uuid=75ca9cc3-68af-413b-8e65-01127207d870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Exploration Broodship</u></a> costs a single green mana, and it doesn’t take long to Station 3 and allow for bonus land each turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can then sacrifice that land to bring back some big, powerful cards from your graveyard. It’s found in the World Shaper Commander Deck, if you’re picking that one up.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">RMS Titanic</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225660"><div id="225660" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering RMS Titanic</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As soon as the rules change was announced, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAKZj?object_uuid=75ca9cc3-68af-413b-8e65-01127207d870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>RMS Titanic</u></a> from the Doctor Who set saw a lot of love, and it’s understandable for what could be a pretty fun (if not entirely functional) Commander.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a 7/1 with a relatively low crew cost, and only costs four mana to bring into play. It’ll also act as a Treasure token engine, has flying and trample. We’d imagine the play here will be buffing it as much as possible to then make a whole host of tokens, which you can then use to bring it back into play with the Commander tax.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Last Ride</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225661"><div id="225661" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering The Last Ride</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another one that could be great fun as a literal last-hurrah, this one-mana black Legendary Vehicle from Aetherdrift (that set feels a while ago, right?) could have meme potential.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OvwD?object_uuid=75ca9cc3-68af-413b-8e65-01127207d870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>The Last Ride</u></a> is strongest the closer you are to death, and being able to roll it out from your Command zone to hit an opponent for big numbers is the kind of chaos we’re here for.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Indomitable</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225662"><div id="225662" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering The Indomitable</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Fancy building a Pirate deck? Here’s your ideal ghost ship to set sail with. <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRpPp?object_uuid=75ca9cc3-68af-413b-8e65-01127207d870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>The Indomitable</u></a> is a 6/6, four-cost Legendary Artifact with Trample and card draw.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also crews with three, but the real bonus is you can pull it from the graveyard if you have enough pirates attacking. Doing so lets you dodge that Commander tax and bring in those card draw opportunities.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Jackdaw</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225663"><div id="225663" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Jackdaw</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">More pirates? Sure, Assassin’s Creed fans, we’ve got you. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xdgl?object_uuid=75ca9cc3-68af-413b-8e65-01127207d870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Jackdaw</u></a> is a 4/4 with Crew 3 and a 3 mana cost, meaning it’s pretty easy to get up and running. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It then gives you <em>the option</em> of discarding your hand and redrawing based on artifact numbers, meaning you can slot it into an Artifact-focused deck and get some obscene card draw.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Weatherlight Compleated</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225664"><div id="225664" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Weatherlight Compleated</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re really keen on a colorless deck (you Eldrazi sickos, we see you), then the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObeYO?object_uuid=75ca9cc3-68af-413b-8e65-01127207d870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Weatherlight Compleated</u></a> is well worth a look. A 5/5 with flying that costs two colorless is nifty in itself, but it also draws when cards die.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn’t ‘Crew’ in the traditional sense, but if you’re throwing a few tokens at a foe you could power it up (and draw/scry) pretty swiftly.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Lumen-Class Frigate</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225665"><div id="225665" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Lumen-Class Frigate</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A new Edge of Eternities option, the<a href="https://zdcs.link/z62kLj?object_uuid=75ca9cc3-68af-413b-8e65-01127207d870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u> Lumen-Class Frigate</u></a> has a pair of Station abilities. The first lets you power up your creatures, making it easier to hit the second.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It could be particularly fun with the Tidus deck from the Final Fantasy set as you swap your counters around to get a flying, lifelink spaceship powered up in various ways.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What to Consider When Picking Your Commander</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As with any Commander, picking a Legendary Vehicle that works into your desired playstyle is important, but many of the vehicles available are colorless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since you can only pick cards within your Commander’s color identity for your deck, that means you’d be limited to colorless cards if you opted for one of those. That may suit you just fine, but it’s worth mentioning.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering’s Spacecraft explained</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Spacecraft make their debut in Edge of Eternities as a new Artifact Subtype. The idea is that your ship uses its ‘Station’ ability to pick up crew. Once you reach the required number of charge counters (calculated from the power of the cards you use to ‘Station’), your ship becomes an Artifact Creature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wurmwall Sweeper, for example, needs to be crewed by four or more, so using ‘Station’ to put a couple of 2/2s in there would work nicely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wizards puts it best in <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/edge-of-eternities-mechanics" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>its mechanics blog</u></a>: “If Wurmwall Sweeper has three charge counters on it, it's not a creature and it doesn't have flying. Once it gets its fourth charge counter, it becomes a 2/2 artifact creature with flying.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Magic: The Gathering's Edge of Eternities Set</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Ready to head to a whole new galaxy?
