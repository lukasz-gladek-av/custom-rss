But Nintendo does not appear to have had much success in locating the culprit, and this week a further cache of development details that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-teraleak-reveals-unannounced-games-seemingly-laying-out-franchises-major-releases-through-2030">seemingly chart The Pokémon Company's roadmap of game releases until at least 2030</a> have hit the internet, timed to hit alongside the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Crimson Collective claimed it had breached Nintendo's servers, and an image purporting to show a long list of Nintendo development files was widely shared on social media. "We have not confirmed any leak of personal information, and there has been no leak of development or business information," Nintendo's statement today reads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Nintendo and The Pokémon Company for comment on this week's further spread of information derived from the Teraleak, but has not heard back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Itagaki's brash nature wasn't fully seen until he started on his own Dead or Alive series in 1998, which featured female characters with strategically-placed "bounce" physics and more than a passing resemblance to SEGA's Virtua Fighter, a series he has mentioned being a fan of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Dead or Alive 2 arrived for the Dreamcast, the graphical leap shone a light on Itagaki and Team Ninja, and the outspoken developer — who became well known for wearing shades at all times — never shied away from commenting on industry trends. Itagaki's Ninja Gaiden launched as an Xbox exclusive in 2004, breathing new life into the hardcore action game franchise. He went on to release Ninja Gaiden Black, considered by some to be one of the greatest action games of all time. Nintendo DS game Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword, and Xbox 360 exclusive Ninja Gaiden 2 followed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/06/03/itagaki-resigns">Itagaki split from Tecmo</a> as part of a heated and very public breakup on June 2, 2008. After resigning from his role, he released a public statement alleging unpaid completion bonuses, with a complaint filed in the Tokyo District Court on May 14, 2008.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He later founded Valhalla Game Studios with several Team Ninja members and released Devil's Third. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/24/ninja-gaiden-creator-steps-down-at-devils-third-studio-will-become-a-consultant">Itagaki stepped down from Valhalla in 2017</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-and-dead-or-alives-tomonobu-itagaki-has-started-a-new-studio">went on to form Itagaki Games in 2021</a>. At the time, Itagaki said he had spent the prior four years teaching game development to a younger generation. However, he felt that he wanted to "make a game again and just established a company for that purpose."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Itagaki's death comes just days before the release of Ninja Gaiden 4, an action sequel he had no involvement with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Tomonobu Itagaki / Facebook.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
