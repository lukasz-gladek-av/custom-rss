In celebration, Sandfall Interactive took the stage to announce that its previously-announced DLC for the game is out...now. Right now!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We learned back in October that this update - which is free, by the way - was happening, we just didn't know when. At the time, Sandfall said it would include a new dungeon, enemies, bosses, and more, new language localizations, new costumes, and "even more surprises." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also shared the following image at the time, which seems to hint at what story the DLC might cover...and we've got a few guesses from staring daggers at it, but we'll let you speculate yourselves. Or, just go play it now.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/unnamed-5-1759855788093-1765512708622.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the news, Sandfall dropped a "Thank You" update trailer that seems to cover a little more of what to expect. There's a colorful new environment full of toys, balloons, and assorted bits and bobs that seems to be an Act 3 location, and comments from Verso about how "Kids have quite the imagination," suggesting that this has something to do with- okay, I don't want to spoil it. It's an Act 3 thing. If you get it, you get it. We get a look at a number of new fantastical enemies, some of which look pretty brutal, and several new costumes that seem to include Maelle in a top hat. There's also a <em>sick</em> photo mode that lets you get down to a granular level of detail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer concludes with a rather creepy-sounding clip of Esquie, and a quick glimpse of a boss fight - is that Simon, again?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the full list of what the update includes, per Sandfall's press release:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>A new, playable environment, taking the characters of Expedition 33 to 'Verso’s Drafts’ - a whimsical storybook adventure with ties to a young Verso. Players will encounter celebratory Gestrals, surprising new locations and an encounter with a sinister, powerful presence... </em></li><li><em>New music tracks by Lorien Testard, the award-winning composer behind the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 soundtrack, which are also now available on digital streaming platforms. You can listen to the playlist on YouTube </em><a href="https://cqqox54ab.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=0013qFP4scKGjUitaJ_g-yCpM0Cbvkfq4OSXzU9l1tqSq8wxHovVAVRhIhBVug_8wvOLnlxomXSxFB4NVQwy5g3_7YbjTOl9SZRdL4LmX5NsXSb4ITbDCcis6zHJ-ZGROcRLub4YsQSxIbxZE-CxRIdHNV2iEkyMU0AgT_mNsQztsQFcWOI1-HfSxUTwtm39GlPxMrFvhXooEIRHTIjT1gx3uF7_iwZmmjb&amp;c=ogilhyBmudh7fIv6DMHh1kN7juLE7iuO5cLaTG9ZesTT9lrPqz_pAg==&amp;ch=xnl1GHI30hHcB900D0q-pewy-jXNMi87kO9pjeTU9JUDeXU0tJv4FA==" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></li><li><em>Challenging boss battles for late-game players to overcome within the Endless Tower.
