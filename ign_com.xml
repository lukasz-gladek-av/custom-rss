            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-working-on-single-player-batman-game-monolith-productions-wonder-woman-in-trouble<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new report has shed light on the turmoil at Warner Bros. Games, while providing an update on the various projects in the works at its developers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reported</a> on concern about the upcoming slate of games from Warner Bros. Games following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-is-leaving-the-company-a-year-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disastrous-launch">the exit of chief David Haddad</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company has had a troubled 12 months, first with the catastrophic release of Rocksteady’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</u></a>, then the disappointing release of Smash Bros.-style brawler <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/multiversus"><u>MultiVersus</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. Discovery has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s failure contributed to a $200 million hit to its business</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business"><u>MultiVersus added another $100 million on top</u></a>. Warner Bros. Games' only other recent release was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions"><u>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</u></a>, which failed to make an impression.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking in a financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav said: "We recognise [the games business] is substantially underperforming its potential right now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-officially-ends-after-final-update-offline-mode-and-true-ending">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League post-launch content has come to an end</a> with the delivery of its year one roadmap, and Warner Bros. has announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-dev-calls-out-threats-to-harm-following-shutdown-announcement-i-am-in-deep-mourning-for-the-game">the impending closure of MultiVersus</a>. Rocksteady, meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-lays-off-staff-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop">has suffered significant layoffs</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also question marks over Mortal Kombat 1’s financial performance, although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-chief-ed-boon-teases-t-1000-fatality-and-future-dlc"><u>NetherRealm chief Ed Boon recently announced over five million sales and teased future DLC following the release of the T-1000 Terminator guest character</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Zaslav said Warner Bros. was doubling down on just four games: Hogwarts Legacy (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-2-coordinating-big-picture-storytelling-with-harry-potter-tv-show-storylines"><u>a sequel is already in the works</u></a>), Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC, "in particular Batman."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are focusing our development efforts on those core franchises, with proven studios to improve our success ratio," Zaslav added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it may be some time before fans see the result of this work. Bloomberg said Monolith Productions’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wonder-woman-the-game">Wonder Woman game</a> is in trouble after reportedly rebooting and switching directors early last year. It’s already cost more than $100 million and is still years away from release, Bloomberg added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monolith’s reimagined Nemesis system (it developed the much-loved Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and its sequel) that would see Wonder Woman befriending enemies has been ditched in favor of a more traditional action adventure game. Its fate “remains in question.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gotham Knights developer WB Games Montreal, meanwhile, pitched a John Constantine game but it was never approved. A Flash game was scrapped after the DCU Flash film bombed. It’s now helping out with other games and is reportedly working on a pitch for a new Game of Thrones game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hogwarts Legacy developer Avalanche is, as officially announced, working on new content for Hogwarts Legacy <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-video-game-sequel-hogwarts-legacy-2-one-of-the-biggest-priorities-at-warner-bros">as well as a sequel</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of Rocksteady will be excited to hear the studio “is looking to return to Batman for a single-player game,” but according to Bloomberg, it’s years away. There is no word in Bloomberg’s report on what’s next from NetherRealm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of this is Warner Bros. Games has, according to Bloomberg, a refreshed version of Hogwarts Legacy, a Lego game, and a few mobile games in the works for the next two years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

"Ooh!" he said in the post, and while this could just be his own excitement, fans are hoping it means a new Super Smash Bros. game is coming to the next-generation hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the post doesn't mean too much by itself, there has been a stream of small hints and teases that could signify Sakurai is gearing up for another Super Smash Bros. game reveal. The famed developer began his own YouTube channel in 2022 but wound it down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/smash-bros-creator-sakurai-says-hes-still-focused-on-making-games">after promising he wasn't done making games</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-quits-youtube-with-final-video-teasing-mystery-new-game">his final video revealed he'd been working on a new game that could be revealed "sooner or later."</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nothing has been announced regarding a new Super Smash Bros. game, however, and Sakurai said previously <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-smash-bros-director-doesnt-see-how-the-franchise-can-get-any-bigger-than-ultimate">he doesn't know how the franchise can get any bigger or better</a> than the Switch entry, which even includes characters from beyond Nintendo like Sephiroth from Final Fantasy 7, Sora from Kingdom Hearts, Joker from Persona 5, Steve and Alex from Minecraft, and many more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it seems likely there will be a new Super Smash Bros. game for Switch 2, given the incredible sales success of Ultimate (35.88 million and counting). And it's worth remembering Nintendo has released a new Super Smash Bros. game for each of its consoles ever since the launch of the original Super Smash Bros. for N64 in 1999.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

However, it did not resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most took Wilson’s comments to mean that if Dragon Age: The Veilguard had “shared-world features" and “deeper engagement,” it might have sold more copies. But, as IGN has reported, a development reboot, backed by EA, saw Dragon Age shift from the skeleton of a multiplayer game with repeatable quests, a tech base, and the outline of a story, to a full-blown single-player RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, former prominent BioWare staff are having their say on social media. David Gaider, who created the setting for Dragon Age and was its narrative lead before leaving BioWare in 2016, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:6idaktmmodnebdn4zeyi7xdn/post/3lhhrokdjcs24" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said EA isn’t learning the right lessons from The Veilguard</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are certainly all sorts of lessons a company could learn from a game like Veilguard (I still haven't played it, so I'm going off what other people have said), but ‘maybe it should have been live service’ being the takeaway seems a bit short-sighted and self-serving,” Gaider, now creative director at Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical developer Summerfall Studios, said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Not that there's any shortage of that, when it comes to deciding why a game doesn't do well. For the anti-woke crowd, for instance, there are woke games that do well and woke games that do poorly and only the ones that did poorly did so *because* they were woke. Says more about them than the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gaider then said EA should follow the lead of Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian and double-down on what Dragon Age did best. Baldur’s Gate 3 is of course a massive hit, and while it has multiplayer co-op, it is a predominantly single-player RPG experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“My advice to EA (not that they care): you have an IP that a lot of people love. Deeply. At its height, it sold well enough to make you happy, right? Look at what it did best at the point where it sold the most. Follow Larian's lead and double down on that. The audience is still there. And waiting,” Gaider continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gaider wasn’t the only former prominent Dragon Age developer to respond to Wilson’s comments. Mike Laidlaw, chief creative officer at Eternal Strands developer Yellow Brick Games and former creative director on Dragon Age, went further and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikelaidlaw.bsky.social/post/3lhhb5ivn3c2h" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that he’d quit if forced to turn a much-loved single-player game into a purely multiplayer game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Look, I'm not a fancy CEO guy, but if someone said to me ‘the key to this successful single-player IP's success is to make it purely a multiplayer game. No, not a spin off: fundamentally change the DNA of what people loved about the core game’ to me, I'd probably, like, quit that job or something,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Laidlaw continued: “Just thinking out loud, of course. Who'd be silly enough to demand something like that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“...twice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Laidlaw did quit BioWare, back in 2017 amid Dragon Age's development troubles. BioWare's ill-fated live service game Anthem launched in 2019.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of recent events is that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-dragon-age-fans-fear-the-death-of-the-series-one-former-bioware-developer-offers-words-of-reassurance-dragon-age-isnt-dead-because-its-yours-now">Dragon Age now appears dead</a>, and BioWare is fully focused on Mass Effect 5, which is led by series veterans including Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts, and Parrish Ley.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA CFO Stuart Canfield touched on EA’s decision to restructure BioWare to focus on the next Mass Effect, which has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dev-bioware-reportedly-down-to-fewer-than-100-employees-following-layoffs-and-staff-exits">reportedly involved cutting the 200-person studio down to less than 100 people</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Historically, blockbuster storytelling has been the primary way our industry bought beloved IP to players,” Canfield said. “The game's financial performance highlights the evolving industry landscape and reinforces the importance of our actions to reallocate resources towards our most significant and highest potential opportunities.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
