Video producer Alex Battaglia called it “perhaps one of the worst-running games I've ever tested for Digital Foundry.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Even if you're running the most powerful hardware around, the stuttering is egregious, dragging down the experience to the point where I really don't understand how this was considered good enough for release,” Battaglia said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And beyond the hitching, we are looking at one of the most bizarrely resource-intensive games I've ever tested - so even if you're OK with lurching stutter, you'll be turning down the settings just to keep the average frame-rate looking acceptable.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps it comes as no surprise then to find that the most-downloaded Oblivion Remastered mod currently on Nexus Mods is P40L0’s ‘<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/35" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultimate Engine Tweaks</a> (Anti-Stutters - Lower Latency - No Film Grain - No Chromatic Aberration - Lossless),’ which has been downloaded a whopping 386,604 times in less than a week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the mod description:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Definitive Unreal ‘Engine.ini’ changes with the goal to remove most stutters, improve performance and stability, decrease input latency, improve picture clarity. All with no visual loss.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After months of UE5 testing, I would like to share my definitive custom ‘Engine.ini’ changes for the game,” P40L0 explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“My goal was to just include as many optimizations as possible (both for CPU/GPU/RAM/SSD) in order to remove most stuttering, improve performance, reduce input latency and improve picture clarity (e.g. by removing Film Grain &amp; Chromatic Aberration, optimize DLSS/FSR upscaling and more) all without any visual loss nor introducing glitches or crashes.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction to the mod from those who downloaded it is overwhelmingly positive. “Stutter be gone! Simply amazing, thanks!” declared chubbyd07. “This .ini is a miracle. From 15-20 fps outside the prison to 65-70 stable. Running on 3600XT and a 2060 with 20GB of RAM (yes),” added yeeto51. “Uhm, what the hell! I went from 60fps on High Preset around Waynon Priory to 90-110fps on the same location. Wizardry!!” said BabaSmith.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the PC version clearly has issued, Oblivion Remastered remains hugely popular, with an impressive Steam concurrent peak player count, and over 4 million players across all platforms. On Steam Oblivion Remastered has a ‘very positive’ user review rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, a hotfix pushed live on April 25 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-update-adds-unexpected-visual-issues-as-bethesda-works-on-a-fix">has affected Microsoft Store players’ UI settings for graphics</a>, specifically related to upscaling and anti-aliasing.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-3-tv-show-vs-game-comparison<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Flowers, first kills, and ‘okay’ kisses. </h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The following article contains </em><em><strong>spoilers </strong></em><em>for The Last of Us season 2, episode 3.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week’s episode of The Last of Us takes a moment to grieve and breathe after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-2-review">last week’s showstopper</a>. It also takes a little detour from the game; much of this episode depicts the reaction of Jackson’s people to the events they’ve just suffered, and their vote on if they should pursue Abby or not. This is all original material for the show, and so there’s actually very few scenes in this episode that are taken straight from the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are four key sequences from this episode that are recreations of moments from the game, and here we’ve compared them against the original source material, analysing what’s changed and what’s stayed the same. You can see both versions in the video above, or read on below for our written explanations. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Joel’s House</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/house-1745831568199.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the harrowing murder of Joel in episode 2, Ellie visits her deceased father-figure’s house to mourn. As in the game, the front yard is covered in flowers left by the residents of Jackson. Unlike the game, though, Ellie enters alone rather than accompanied by Dina. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The show’s version of Joel’s house features many of the same props that decorated this location in the game, including his workshop room full of carved animals. In Joel’s bedroom, the bed linen is the same blue and white sheets. More importantly there’s the same red box on the bed that contains his signature items: the broken watch and his revolver. Ellie takes these and holsters the revolver in the waistband of her jeans, just as she does in the game.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Tommy’s Plans</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/tommy-revenge-1745831590003.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The need for revenge begins to rise when Ellie talks to Tommy about what happened. While the broad strokes of this scene are the same in both show and game, particularly in tone, the actual setting and words are not recreated one-to-one. In both versions Ellie is angry and frustrated that Tommy wants to be more sensible about their next move, and so tonally the scenes match. However, where in the game this conversation takes place in a quiet, private room between just the two of them, in the show it’s conducted out in the open with Dina present.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of dialogue there are close matches – both versions of Ellie say that Joel “would be halfway to Seattle by now” if the situation was reversed. Both versions of Tommy also note that Jackson would be left vulnerable, although in the show this is a clear reference to the prior episode’s horde attack rather than the game’s more general assessment. In both scenarios Tommy says it’s ultimately up to Maria as to if they get to hunt down Abby, but in the show he says that it will need to go to a full town vote, while the game version says he expects there will be “folks she can spare”. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Ride to Seattle</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/horse-1745831609043.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Ellie and Dina head out to Seattle on horseback in search of Abby and her group. In both versions Dina asks Ellie to recall the first person she killed, and Ellie proceeds to explain how she saved Joel from a bandit in the first game/season. While the show’s dialogue is not an exact match to the game’s script, the details are largely the same – Joel was attacked and Ellie pulled the trigger to save him. The conversation is longer in the game, however, as Dina reciprocates with her own story of her first kill. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later, the pair discover an overgrown car, which they consider a sign that they’re finally close to Seattle. This is, again, broadly similar to a moment from the game, even if the dialogue line is not a one-to-one match. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6 out of 10</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/28/kiss-1745831633066.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the episode we see Ellie and Dina camped out in a tent. Before lights out, Dina asks Ellie a question: how would she rate their kiss at the dance out of 10? This moment is a recreation of a scene from the game, but the timing and content of this conversation is notably different to the original game version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the game, Dina asks Ellie to rate the kiss while they are smoking marijuana at Eugene’s weed den. As we know from last week’s episode, this doesn’t happen in the show since it is Jesse, not Dina, who accompanies Ellie to Eugene’s den. It’s not just the time and location of this exchange that is altered, though. In the show, Ellie says that she’d rate the kiss a six, something that Dina is playfully upset about. In the game, it’s flipped – Ellie hesitates to answer, and so Dina says she’d score it a “solid six”. The two interpretations showcase very different dynamics; Dina in the game is much more confident and knows how to pull Ellie’s strings – she enjoys teasing her. Dina in the show, meanwhile, is depicted as more “teenage” in her approach, which emphasises the “young girls in the apocalypse” element of their love story.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from The Last of Us, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-spoiler-free">spoiler-free season two review</a> and our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-3-review">spoiler-filled review of the third episode</a>.

GnoblinXD found they were able to move through the invisible barrier set in place to prevent this sort of thing, and, from there, simply jumped their way across the river and up the cliff face in classic The Elder Scrolls fashion.</p><div><blockquote data-embed-height="546" data-embed-theme="light">Posts from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k7qy1r/apparently_you_can_just_leave_cyrodiil/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oblivion</a><br> community on Reddit</blockquote></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“I explored a bit and was surprised to find basically the whole landmass of the map was there, even if not detailed ofc,” GnoblinXD said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valenwood itself is a barren area, devoid of life, cities, NPCs, or even trees. There are a number of graphics and environmental issues GnoblinXD ran into while exploring here, which you’d expect given the developers of Oblivion Remastered never intended it to be explored in the first place. GnoblinXD tried to reach what they believe to be the Summerset Isles west of Valenwood, but fell afoul of the void. Reloading from saves set outside the bounds of Cyrodiil do not appear to work, forcing GnoblinXD to restart inside its borders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want details, GnoblinXD uploaded a video, below, showing exactly how to get into Valenwood via this new border-breaking discovery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Undeterred, GnoblinXD later uploaded images of their journey to Hammerfell, the province in the west of Tamriel rumored to be the setting of the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-latest-news-trailers-rumors-release-date">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda has remained tight-lipped on where the next brand new The Elder Scrolls game will take place. All we have to go on is the game’s 36-second announcement teaser, which presents a towering stretch of mountains and a picturesque coastline overlooking a vast ocean. The prevailing theory is that the sequel will let players loose in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/14/e3-2018-why-the-elder-scrolls-6-might-be-set-in-familiar-grounds"><u>Hammerfell</u></a> – the central setting of The Elder Scrolls 2: Daggerfall and The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard, as well as a visitable location in The Elder Scrolls Online. With tropical forests, harsh mountains and scenic coastal cities, Hammerfell’s depictions in previous Elder Scrolls games seem to align with the teaser, hinting that we may be set to explore the Redguards’ homeland once again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To get to Hammerfell, GnoblinXD passed the southern Valenwood gap and walked around the port city of Anvil, the westernmost city in Cyrodiil, and up towards Hammerfell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After many an hour spent searching, I finally found my way to the other side of Cyrodiil's northern border!” GnoblinXD said. “The region seems vast. Much bigger than the Valenwood/Elsweyr area. The landmass stretches way beyond render-distance, so who knows how far it goes... Likely there is nothing here, but I'm intrigued nonetheless.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now here’s where things get really interesting. GnoblinXD tried to find the coastline from the The Elder Scrolls VI teaser, walking west towards where that area would be in-game, but ended up falling off the edge of the map (“I didn't die, but now I'm stuck in the backrooms of Oblivion, lol.”).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps GnoblinXD will eventually be able to find that area, or perhaps another player will manage it. Either way, the challenge is set for a glimpse at what may end up being the setting of one of the most-anticipated video games ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I got here using no mods, glitches or console commands, my game is entirely vanilla,” GnoblinXD insisted. “Oh, and it's kind of funny that Hammerfell seems thoroughly covered in forests while Valenwood had no trees at all, lol.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Anyway, time for me to do some exploring, might update more later :)”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so they did, this time pictures of a journey into the aforementioned Elsweyr. Elsweyr is of course home to the Khajiit, the playable bestial and feline race feature in all the main The Elder Scrolls games so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s brilliant about this out of bounds area is that from within it you can see what very much looks like The Throat of the World, the highest mountain of Tamriel and perhaps the most iconic location in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It is here that the Dragonborn climbs the Seven Thousand Steps to the ancient monastery of High Hrothgar, where the order of the Greybeards dwells, and learns from them Shouts and speaks with the dragon, Paarthurnax.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s right, you can go to Skyrim in Oblivion Remastered, but you can't actually travel far enough in to get to The Throat of the World or see any sign of life.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">This is so cool. If you go to the edge of the map in Oblivion Remastered, you can see Skyrim’s tallest mountain, The Throat of the World, off in the distance. This was not in the original game <a href="https://t.co/oilOVpeuXF" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/oilOVpeuXF</a></p>— sackchief 🍂 (@sackchief) <a href="https://twitter.com/sackchief/status/1915267907178713412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Much like Valenwood, Elsweyr is quite barren once you leave the border area with Cyrodiil,” GnoblinXD explained. “Unlike Valenwood, however, I suppose the lack of flora and fauna is somewhat more lore-accurate. With that said I found neither cats nor deserts, unfortunately, and most heartbreaking of all, no Moon Sugar :(</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I ran around a bit looking for anything of interest, taking some pictures along the way. I decided to see how far south you could go. Well, it turns out you can go quite far. After reaching and going beyond the southern edge of Elsweyr, there seemed only to be endless sea, so I decided to head east towards Black Marsh instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And, oh boy, Black Marsh is definitely... uh... Unique, let's say. I might make a post about it at some point if people want to see. I didn't see how far east I could go, but very interestingly there is a HUGE landmass beyond the far eastern edge of the map.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">GnoblinXD is still mid-journey outside Cyrodiil, and may uncover even more areas to explore and famous landmarks looming over the horizon. They managed to find their way to both the Morrowind and Skyrim side of the border, but the walkable area doesn’t extend far. “So no selfies from the Throat of The World, unfortunately :(“ GnoblinXD said. However, after their initial post blew up on reddit (19,000 upvotes and counting), it seems others may make discoveries of their own. And so it has proven.
