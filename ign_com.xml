I felt it was going to be a relatively soft follow-up to the game’s most popular set ever, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-where-to-buy-in-stock"><u>Universes Beyond: Final Fantasy</u></a>, and yet it feels like another home run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A great new setting, unique designs, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-most-expensive-cards"><u>some big chase cards</u></a> have seen stock selling out fast, particularly when it comes to Collector Boosters. As a result, you can still find them, but you’ll need to brave the secondary market - and pay over the odds, sadly.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where To Find Magic’s Edge of Eternities Collector Boosters</h2><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbVD8?object_uuid=ec6495ad-2258-4679-a22e-6d0f3b704701&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Edge of Eternities Collector Booster Pack<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/akK8Y3?object_uuid=ec6495ad-2258-4679-a22e-6d0f3b704701&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Edge of Eternities Collector Booster Box<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Because they contain a higher chance of opening chase cards worth hundreds (and maybe even thousands), Collector Boosters cost more than Play Boosters and are also unlikely to be reprinted.

The set is standard legal for a long time yet, meaning you can reasonably expect Play Boosters (and the set’s pair of Commander Decks) to be reprinted pretty regularly.</p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/av42YP?object_uuid=ec6495ad-2258-4679-a22e-6d0f3b704701&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Edge of Eternities Play Booster Pack<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zEgY7o?object_uuid=ec6495ad-2258-4679-a22e-6d0f3b704701&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Edge of Eternities Play Booster Box<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/av42YP?object_uuid=ec6495ad-2258-4679-a22e-6d0f3b704701&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Play Boosters can be found for as little as $6</u></a>, with <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEgY7o?object_uuid=ec6495ad-2258-4679-a22e-6d0f3b704701&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>boxes up for around $150</u></a>.

"For years, Blizzard has been a place where people could build their careers and stay for decades, but that stability’s been fading. With a union, we’re able to preserve what makes this place special, secure real transparency in how decisions are made, and make sure policies are applied fairly to everyone.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
