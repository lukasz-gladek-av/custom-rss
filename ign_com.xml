            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo fans now know who developed Switch 2 launch title Welcome Tour — the mini-game collection that also acts as an interactive instruction manual for the new console, which many have suggested should have been included for free.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> doesn't state it within the game itself, Mario Party studio Nintendo Cube, formerly NDCube, has now updated its <a href="https://www.nintendo-cube.co.jp/works/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> to confirm the game is its work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Cube is a Tokyo-based subsidiary of Nintendo founded in 2000 that frequently handles the company's various mini-game collection projects. It developed the so-so Wii Party (not to be confused with the better Wii Play, which came with a packed-in Wii Remote), as well as the disappointing Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival on Wii U. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, Nintendo Cube released the functional Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics for Switch 1, before the infamous Everybody 1-2 Switch — a party game sequel launched with little fanfare that earned Nintendo some of its worst review scores in recent memory. ("Everybody 1-2-Switch might be the first party game I’ve played where I ended up with fewer friends afterwards," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everybody-1-2-switch-review">IGN wrote in its 4/10 appraisal</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's for Mario Party that Nintendo Cube is best known, having taken over as the hugely popular party game series' main developer beginning with 2012's Mario Party 9 onwards, and continuing with Mario Party 10, Mario Party Star Rush, Mario Party: The Top 100, Super Mario Party and Mario Party Superstars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Cube's next launch is (deep breath) Super Mario Party Jamboree: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV, a Switch 2 update for Super Mario Party Jamboree that makes use of the new console's mouse controls and optional camera peripheral, due to arrive on July 24.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While a budget-priced release, criticism was levelled at Welcome Tour for the sheer number of its mouse-control games, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-which-everyone-thinks-should-be-free-requires-95-of-accessories-and-a-4k-tv-for-100-completion">the need to have a camera peripheral, a Switch 2 Charging Grip or Pro Controller, and a 4K TV to see everything it had to offer</a>, and complete the game with gold medals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Even if Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour were the pack-in game it feels like it was meant to be, the execution of its charming concept is a muddled collection of quaint tech demos and boring factoids dressed up as an uncompelling completionist checklist," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-review">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

IGN has contacted Microsoft for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Turn 10 Studios' original Forza Motorsport launched for the OG Xbox in 2005, and established the series as one of Microsoft's core gaming brands, as well as a serious rival to PlayStation's Gran Turismo. Seven Forza Motorsport sequels have launched since, spread across every Xbox console generation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the series' original sim racing side has increasingly been eclipsed by the success of Forza Horizon, the franchise's newer, open-world spin-off that first launched on Xbox 360 in 2012.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A developer who worked on Microsoft's now-cancelled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled">Perfect Dark reboot</a> has addressed the claim that last year's gameplay demo was "fake," and said the glimpse was a vertical slice of the project running "in-engine."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perfect Dark was one of several projects canned by Microsoft this week as part of the company's latest devastating cuts to Xbox staff and games. Developed by The Initiative, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">a studio Microsoft is now shutting down</a>, alongside Tomb Raider studio Crystal Dynamics, Perfect Dark had rarely been glimpsed since its initial <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-perfect-dark-announced-from-the-initiative">announcement back in 2020</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That all changed last year when a "gameplay reveal" video aired as part of the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2024. And it's this video that has since sparked questions over how much of what it shows corresponds to actual, working game systems. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Kotaku writer Ethan Gach <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lsypye2edk2v" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> on social media that he had been told last year's demo had been "basically fake." The question of the gameplay demo's legitimacy was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adammcdlt.bsky.social/post/3lt23bz2dwk2z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussed</a> in more detail by former Perfect Dark developer Adam McDonald, who now works as a senior game designer at Cuphead maker Studio MDHR.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It is actually in-engine," McDonald said. "I was one of three level designers that worked on it. It worked best if you played it the way the person playing in the video plays it, but it still worked even if you didn't hit the marks perfectly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's some fake stuff in it," he continued, "and the real gameplay systems shown off worked juuust enough to look good in this video. We were rapidly making real design decisions so as to not knowingly lie to players about what the game will be. The parkour is all real, the hacking/deception is mostly real.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The combat is 'real' in that someone had to really do all that stuff in the video, but it's set up to be played exactly that way and didn't play well if you played it a different way."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Perfect Dark Reboot Gameplay Reveal Screenshots - Xbox Games Showcase 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What McDonald is saying then, is that there's nuance here. Like many vertical slices meant to showcase a project that's still in development, it was made to work just enough, and to give a sense of how the final game would have appeared, had the project survived until launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">McDonald's suggestion here seems to be that the team behind it intended to show something that gave as accurate a sense of what Perfect Dark would be as was possible. That said, some elements clearly still sound like they were a work-in-progress, even if they were meant to be representative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm seeing big controversy over 'THIS WHOLE THING WAS FAKE' and it's annoying me, so I wanted to say something," McDonald concluded. Then, in a reply to another user, McDonald said "it was a pretty typical vertical slice" and "I don't think we were particularly deceptive with it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: "It's probably more real than you think. We were figuring stuff out on the fly in time to include it in the demo, doing our best not to 'lie' to players. There's some fakery but quite a lot of it was legit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After the cancellation of Perfect Dark, Rare's long-awaited Everwild, an MMO from Bethesda's The Older Scrolls Online team and cuts to other projects, it's believed that every game featured at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced">the Xbox Games Showcase presentation in June</a> this year will continue on.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Stop Killing Games</u></a> initiative has reached the crucial 1 million signatures milestone in its quest to preserve video games for decades to come, but its fight isn’t over yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The self-described consumer movement soared past the goal yesterday, July 3, cementing its status as an impressive petition in gaming history and a movement that has plenty of gas left in the tank. It’s all in the name of protecting the video games players love – and even the ones they don’t – as the industry steadily marches toward a digital future.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">A lot of games we buy today are built to just stop working when the publisher pulls the plug on em. It needs to stop. If you are EU citizen please consider signing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/stopkillinggames?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#stopkillinggames</a> initiative. <a href="https://t.co/vlyIEXcpnh" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/vlyIEXcpnh</a> <a href="https://t.co/nsTusFyGrL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/nsTusFyGrL</a></p>— Pat_ (@Pat8_8) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pat8_8/status/1940300022526222441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Social media feeds have since filled with reactions from supporters praising an operation that could help save multiplayer and single-player games for future generations. While gamers take to the internet to celebrate, spokesperson and organizer Ross Scott says reaching 1 million signatures is good news but far from a victory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“OK, the breaking news: The European Citizens’ Initiative has crossed 1 million signatures – except it hasn’t,” Scott said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmkCQJrc9n4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a video update</u></a> uploaded yesterday. “This is going to kill morale, but there are two things going on here. The first we knew was coming. Every time somebody makes a mistake when they sign the Initiative, their signature gets invalidated. So that means we need more signatures to make up for everybody’s mistakes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an important variable in the equation on the road to 1 million legitimate Stop Killing Games endorsements, and it’s just one flaw to consider. The other involves reports Scott has received regarding fabricated signatures that could be artificially inflating the initiative’s progress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“First off, I want to say that this is not a Change.org petition,” Scott adds. “This is a government process. Spoofing signatures on it is a crime. Please do not do this. They’ll be checked later by the EU commission, and my guess is the fake ones will get turned over to the Europol or Interpol, and they’ll follow up on this.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">To anyone who made a mistake or isn't sure if they signed the EU initiative already, you can contact the official spokesperson (Daniel Ondruska) and he can direct you on how to reach the EU to sort it out. His contact is on the page under "more info"<a href="https://t.co/EpnNTDR85U" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/EpnNTDR85U</a></p>— Accursed Farms (@accursedfarms) <a href="https://twitter.com/accursedfarms/status/1941018169977852169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">To account for what could be a significant number of invalid Stop Killing Games signatures, the initiative has altered its ideal goal to be 1.4 million signatures. At the time of this story’s publication, Stop Killing Games has reached 1.07 million endorsements ahead of its July 31 end date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, yeah, that sucks,” Scott continued. “We’ll just keep plodding away unless we can figure out what the safe numbers are. Sorry this isn’t a big victory celebration. This is just kind of suspenseful and tense instead, and will probably hurt the morale of people signing.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save States</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Scott, who has created gaming content via his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Accursed_Farms" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Accursed Farms</u></a> YouTube channel for more than a decade, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w70Xc9CStoE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>launched</u></a> Stop Killing Games in April 2024 as a direct response to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-crew-delisted-from-all-digital-storefronts-servers-shut-down-early-2024"><u>Ubisoft’s decision to shut down its popular open-world racing game, The Crew</u></a>. The movement aims to create a ripple effect that could shake the industry into keeping games online long after players lose interest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It means everything from The Crew to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-concords-servers-now-closed-fans-wonder-if-itll-return-as-free-to-play-at-least-one-expert-has-doubts"><u>Concord</u></a> could theoretically remain online to enjoy should the initiative amass enough public complaints to see the European Commission pass a law protecting consumer rights. Ideally, players could see live-service and multiplayer titles like BioWare’s Anthem, which was given <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-will-shut-down-anthem-in-january"><u>a shutdown schedule</u></a> just yesterday, could continue on in some form should a publisher decide to sunset support. Success could also mean single-player games that rely on online components, such as Death Stranding or Dark Souls, could remain intact, too.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>WEAK</p><p>I know Anthem got panned, but it's another example of one that seems like it had a cool looking world to run around in. I was interested in trying it out and keeping my expectations low. Yet another example of why SKG is so needed.<a href="https://t.co/fDsq0ZsP8K" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/fDsq0ZsP8K</a></p></div>— Accursed Farms (@accursedfarms) <a href="https://twitter.com/accursedfarms/status/1940891094214226104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Stop Killing Games wants to save the art that developers pour their hearts into while protecting consumers who prefer to access games they’ve already paid for, and it’s a movement that hundreds of thousands of game players are already supporting. Following its promising launch last year, however, the initiative struggled to maintain the support it needed to push its way through to the eyes that needed to see it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stop Killing Games’ chances at a successful campaign became so dire that Scott went as far as to publish a video titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfRLujXtUo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The end of Stop Killing Games</u></a>” just last week. In the hour-long explainer piece, Scott listed a lack of exposure as one primary cause behind the lack of support. It was the Hail Mary the initiative needed, though, as prominent YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_5WIzkM0r8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jacksepticeye</u></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJpTCitKqw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>penquinz0/Cr1TiKaL</u></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlmulltSgWg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ludwig</u></a>, and more were quick to voice their support with their own videos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All within the weeks since Scott shared his concerns, Stop Killing Games has gained hundreds of thousands of signatures, resulting in a solid chunk of the more than 1 million names attached to the movement today. Success remains uncertain even if Scott is able to reach that magic 1.4 million number, with even more uncertainty lying on the other side of that goal post. Still, as outlined by Scott on the Stop Killing Games website, he feels optimistic about the future of game preservation if the signature goal is met.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If we can pass the signature threshold," Scott says, "there is a very strong chance that the European Commission will pass new law that will both protect consumer rights to retain video games that customers have purchased and advance preservation efforts massively."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Should the word get out to enough interested individuals, players could see somewhat of a return to the days when buying a game came with the assurance that it would remain playable regardless of post-launch interference.

The ad shows two happily smiling people, with the tagline: "Our Business is life itself..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umbrella existing likely places Resident Evil Survival Unit before the events of Resident Evil 4, by which point the evil organisation has crumbled. Could we be looking at the woods around the Arklay Mountains, near Raccoon City? We can just about glimpse a mountain range in the background, so it's possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to imagine a real-time shooter taking advantage of the events seen in and around the Resident Evil game, where several teams of STARS commandos — characters that fans have now grown to care about — most be poked and prodded into action, while kept alive for as long as you can. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/04/gu-nhjaw0aa2prp-1751619726566.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Resident Evil Survival Unit.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">An accompanying press release states that Survival Unit is "designed to appeal to both long-time fans and new players," suggesting we will see some familiar faces or settings here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And with the main series headed back to Raccoon City in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, and supposedly picking up the storyline of Umbrella, now seems a good time to revisit the setting and events that started it all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Survival Unit will launch in Japan, South Korea, North America, Europe, and Asia, published by anime company Aniplex, a subsidiary of Sony.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid the video game cancelations and studio closures that have come as a result of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">Microsoft’s devastating round of layoffs this week</a> is concern about the fate of pretty much every Xbox game without a firm release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft games canceled as part of the cuts include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox">Rare’s Everwild</a>, an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-unannounced-mmo-was-doing-well-and-even-scaling-up-as-xbox-cancelation-blindsided-staff-sources-say">unannounced MMO from ZeniMax Online Studios</a>, the developer of The Elder Scrolls Online, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">the Perfect Dark Reboot</a>. The latter's developer, The Initiative, was shut down. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-says-warcraft-rumble-wont-get-any-new-content-as-microsoft-layoffs-hit-development-team">The team working on Blizzard’s mobile game Warcraft Rumble was laid off as new content ceased</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, external developers who were funded by Microsoft were also hit. Romero Games, the studio founded by Doom co-creator John Romero and Brenda Romero, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/update-romero-games-employee-says-whole-studio-subject-to-layoffs-after-microsoft-pulls-funding-for-new-shooter-from-doom-co-creator-john-romero">has suffered significant layoffs and the future of its new shooter is in doubt</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a lot to take in, but it begs the question: which Xbox Game Studios games remain? And which, if any, were quietly canceled?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a memo sent to all Microsoft gaming staff and viewed by IGN this week, Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios, said Microsoft still has "more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, a source told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> that every game featured at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced">the Xbox Games Showcase presentation in June</a> is continuing on. So, what were those games, which we now assume are safe — at least for the time being?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was at the show, and is certain to come out later this year (despite the layoffs hitting its various developers). inXile game Clockwork Revolution starred at the show, so that’s safe. Obsidian’s Grounded 2 and The Outer Worlds 2 were at the show and we should assume are both safe. It's a similar deal for Double Fine’s Keeper, The Coalition’s Gears of War: Reloaded, Ninja Gaiden 4, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s Order of the Giants DLC. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4, and the ROG Xbox Ally, both at the show, will continue too. Despite the cancelation of Everwild, Rare’s Sea of Thieves continues with new updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the showcase, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-teases-return-of-halo-in-2026-and-its-reportedly-a-halo-combat-evolved-remaster">Xbox boss Phil Spencer teased Forza, Fable, Gears of War: E-Day, and a Halo: Combat Evolved remake for 2026</a>. We assume since those games were mentioned, they’re safe,  although it’s worth noting that the Forza mentioned by Spencer no doubt relates to the next Forza Horizon game from Playground, which is also making Fable. Turn 10, which makes the more sim-focused Forza games, was hit hard by the layoffs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, we know which games Microsoft still intends to release. But, given the events of this week, it’s now impossible to think about other Xbox games in the works without a degree of concern. Everwild and Perfect Dark were conspicuous by their absence at last month's show and both were canceled. What else failed to turn up?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Minecraft — remember Microsoft owns Minecraft! — remains huge and safe as houses, you feel. But what about Contraband from Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios? Where’s Undead Labs’ State of Decay 3? Ninja Theory’s Project Mara? Microsoft has a Hideo Kojima game, OD, on its books. Is that still happening? Toys for Bob, the Crash Bandicoot 4 developer and Call of Duty support studio that left the Xbox-owned Activision in February 2024, signed an agreement with Xbox directly to publish its next game. Is that still alive?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what about Bethesda? ZOS’s MMO has fallen by the wayside, but surely Bethesda Game Studios' The Elder Scrolls VI and the next Fallout are fine. Starfield’s promised next expansion feels precarious, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-starfields-xbox-no-show-even-its-most-loyal-fans-are-starting-to-worry-bethesda-makes-it-so-hard-to-defend-this-game">given Bethesda's radio silence on the game</a>. And what about Blizzard? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-working-on-a-starcraft-shooter-with-ex-far-cry-chief-dan-hay-at-the-helm">As of last year it was reportedly hard at work on a StarCraft shooter</a>. Is that still the case?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s only when you run through what <em>wasn’t</em> at the Xbox Games Showcase last month that you realize what’s at stake here: Microsoft owns a huge number of development studios across the globe, from Bethesda to Blizzard and Activision to Halo. When Xbox suffers significant problems, a huge swathe of the video game industry and its developers do, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are on August's gamescom, where Microsoft is expected to show more of what is has coming down the line. Perhaps Phil Spencer will give fans a clear idea of what’s in the works from Xbox and what isn't as Microsoft's multiplatform push soldiers on. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-first-party-next-generation-xbox-consoles-announces-deal-with-amd-and-promises-full-backwards-compatibility-with-your-existing-xbox-library">It is still planning to release a next-gen Xbox console</a>, although we don't know when. Is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-plans-to-release-an-xbox-handheld-but-its-years-away">the first-party Xbox handheld Spencer teased</a> last year also still alive? Does Microsoft still plan to release its own gaming app store, despite the failure of <a href="https://in.ign.com/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile/231166/news/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-activision-shuts-down-its-battle-royale-mobile-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Call of Duty Warzone Mobile</a>, Warcraft Rumble, and this week's significant cuts to Candy Crush maker King? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the short term, at least, the games we saw in June are still on the way. But the long term future of Xbox remains vague indeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
