            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A ton of popular games are included.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon's October Prime Day has ended, but the online retailer is already offering a new "Buy 2, Get 1 50% Off" sale this week. There's a little bit of everything for everyone in here, from classic family games to modern party games. If you've been hoping to add some more board games to your tabletop collection, right now is a great time to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sale itself is fairly straightforward: Amazon has a big <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2XPE?object_uuid=36931a4c-0172-46ee-99b4-5d30882de1af&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>list of items that are included in the promotion</strong></a> and all you need to do is add two in your cart and the 50% discount will be applied to whatever the cheaper one is. That means if you want to take full advantage of the savings, you'll want to buy two similarly priced items. I've gathered some of the best board game options in the sale here, which are based off of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/board-game-reviews">IGN's own board game reviews</a> and recommendations. There are also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tons-of-popular-jigsaw-puzzles-are-buy-1-get-1-half-off-at-amazon-today">jigsaw puzzles included in the sale</a> if you want to mix and match for the full discount.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Buy 1, Get 1 50% Off Board Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The amount of options to choose from in this sale is truly staggering, and it's difficult to choose only a few recommendations to highlight. Are you looking for intriguing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-murder-mystery-board-games">murder mystery games</a> to play during a Halloween party? Do you need a fun <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board game</a> you can break out on weekends? Are you hoping to find a great <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy game</a> that will take all night to play? There are tabletop options for all of those scenarios right here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those working with a smaller budget, I'd recommend checking out Flip 7. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/flip-7-card-game-review">reviewed it earlier this year</a> and absolutely loved it. It's a fairly easy push-you-luck card game that can be played in under 20 minutes. At only $8, it's already cheap, and this promotion will end up dropping that price down to just $4 when you buy something else (that's at least $8) with it. All-in-all, it's an easy recommendation to make for anyone who just wants a fun game that has a shallow learning curve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for something a bit heartier that's still family friendly, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-board-game-buying-guide-and-expansions">Ticket to Ride</a> – both the original U.S. and some of the European versions – is also included here. This game is a modern classic that does a great job of combining simple gameplay with stimulating turn-based strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you find a game you like, the next step is picking out a good second option to take full advantage of the discount. I'd recommend browsing through some of the classic board games here that are essential for any collection, stuff like Clue, Catan, Sorry!, and multiple versions of Monopoly. If you don't already have those, now is a great time to pick one or more up for a substantial discount.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Is Now a Good Time to Buy Board Games?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week we saw some pretty <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/board-game-deals-october-prime-day-2025">great board game deals for October Prime Day</a>, but with that sale over and Black Friday on the horizon, you may be wondering if you should be making a purchase right now. While it's true that Amazon will likely have better board game deals for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday">Black Friday</a> this year, this buy 1, get 1 50% off sale is still a great way to save money right now. If you are looking to grab some stocking stuffers or a family game to play <em>before</em> the holidays, then this sale makes it a good time to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that in mind, you'll still want to wait for better discounts if you're planning on making bigger purchases. Some of the bigger campaign board games that are $100 or more are not included in this sale and aren't likely to be discounted until November.</p></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 13, 2025 7:42 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-buy-1-get-1-half-off-board-game-sale-october-2025]]></content:encoded>

As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-off-to-huge-start-on-steam-with-over-740000-concurrent-players-just-hours-after-launch">more than 740,000 players gathered to play on Steam alone</a>, a new discussion about in-game classes has bubbled to the top with one question: are medics doing their job?</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Revive in Battlefield 6 (animation)<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Battlefield</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Battlefield6</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/NeebsOfficial?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@NeebsOfficial</a> <a href="https://t.co/RM5RHclAfX" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/RM5RHclAfX</a></p>— SiegeTales (@SiegeTales) <a href="https://twitter.com/SiegeTales/status/1976610593843868039?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Support class no doubt plays an important role in any Battlefield 6 multiplayer match. While Assault, Engineer, and Recon classes, too, bring important tools and skills to a fight, it’s only the Support class that can get downed soldiers back on their feet at lightning speed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Squad mates of any class are free to revive each other with or without the medic tools in Support, though they are locked only to reviving players in their squad and take much longer to pick them up. Support players do not have these squad limitations and can instantly revive a soldier with things like defibrillators.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With dozens of teammates in every Battlefield 6 match, there’s always plenty of players looking to be revived, and as buildings are often crumbling down around them, the chances of being picked up aren’t always too likely. Heightening the stress on both ends are measurements for downed players showing how far away the nearest group of medics is. When JohnBattlefield2000 opts not to revive you at just five meters away, things tend to get a bit heated.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some have already begun using the repair tool, a gadget wielded by engineers to repair vehicles (and draw on walls) in Battlefield for years, to leave messages for Support medics who neglect their fallen comrades.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest Steam Next Fest began this week, showcasing a wide range of upcoming titles. And as has become a trend, publishing platform <a href="https://indie.io/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>indie.io</u></a> has several titles featured. To celebrate, it has launched a campaign called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/indieio/sale/next_fest_party_indie_io" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Next Fest Party</u></a> that will run from October 13–20 and includes free demos for 12 different games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The games come from a variety of different developers in a variety of different genres, so we figured we’d give you a rundown of everything that’s available. Below you’ll find brief descriptions of each game, with each title linked to its free demos so you can try them for yourself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3772390/Monsters_and_Me_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Monsters and Me</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This 2D top-down roguelite shooter is chaotic, silly, and a bit gross (well, as gross as a 2D game can be). Your city has been overrun with slime mutants who have one goal in mind: ripping your face off. The natural reaction should be to prevent that, so you’ll need to upgrade your weapons and special abilities to fend off the horde. The demo drops you into the game’s first level, and you just need to survive as long as you can. Simple, right?</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3694540/Kriophobia_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Kriophobia</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Kriophobia also challenges you to survive, but in a VERY different way. You play as Anna, a geophysicist who’s trapped in a frozen Soviet bunker … and something else is down there with you. This is classic psychological horror, perfect for spooky season and for players who don’t want their hands held. Combat is tense and difficult, to the point it’s sometimes best avoided altogether. The demo is a standalone section of the game’s second chapter, where you’ll have to contend with the cold, mysterious abominations, and Anna’s traumatic past.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3931400/PLAGUN__The_Plague_Goes_On_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Plagun</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This pixel shooter is a bullet-hell roguelike set in a post-apocalyptic kingdom where an attempted cure for death resulted in an all-consuming plague instead. You were a doctor before this event, but now you must use cursed masks and plague-infused weapons to deal with escalating waves of enemies. The demo is a vertical slice that will give you a sense of the game’s fast pace and let you experiment with different cursed masks and power-ups.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2237320/Dwarf_Delve/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Dwarf Delve</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s time to pick up your Battlemallet, go delving into mines, and try to safely make it out with as many riches as you can in this first-person extraction roguelite. The mines are randomly generated, so no two trips are the same. You’ll need to craft items like support beams and ladders to traverse dangerous areas, as well as utilize lanterns and floodlights to see in the darkness. Once you’ve grabbed your loot, you’ll need to be wary of traps and other dangers on your way back to safety. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2492980/Heistfest_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Heistfest</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you like stealing stuff and then causing untold destruction throughout the city as you try to make your escape while an escalating police force chases you? Well, great news. That’s the premise of the aptly named Heistfest. You’ll speed your way through hand-drawn environments, and things will get more intense the longer you evade capture. And if you think that means just adding some more cop cars and maybe some guns, think again. You’ll have to deal with spike traps, helicopters, paratroopers, tanks, and full-on airstrikes. Chaos and fun are more important than realism anyway. The demo is a vertical slice that gives you a sense of the core gameplay loop: rob a bank, spark a police chase, and see how long you can survive as public enemy #1.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3330930/Locked_in_my_Darkness_2_The_Room/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Locked in My Darkness 2: The Room</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s Halloween time, so of course there can’t just be one scary game on this list. This one is a psychological horror walking sim focused on atmosphere, exploration, and puzzle solving. You play as Yuki Tachibana, a Japanese high school student who recently moved into a new apartment with her family. Something sinister awakens within the walls of their new home, warping reality and dredging up sins of the past. With flashlight in hand, you’ll uncover notes, solve environmental puzzles, and reveal the secrets of Yuki’s family.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3392150/Nullstar_Solus_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Nullstar: Solus</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You are Solus, a scavenger drone sent to salvage the nullstar from a dying world. But there’s only one goal that really matters in this game: be faster. You’ll need to master the flying mechanics, thrusters, and momentum to make it through levels as quickly as possible. Those levels are high-risk, high-reward, and you’ll need to stay on your toes to deal with everything they can throw at you.  </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3544390/Air_Hares/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Air Hares</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You probably haven’t seen a bullet hell quite like this one. In Air Hares, your main goal isn’t shooting enemies out of the sky; it’s using your plane to seed and water crops to save the starving people of the barren Winrose Warren. But your feathered foes in the Gale Gang want to stop you, so you’ll need to dodge, jab, and ram them to send them packing and get back to your important work. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1908520/Binary_Golf_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Binary Golf</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Miniature golf gets a chaotic overhaul in Binary Golf, where you use your golf ball to eliminate targets until the final one becomes the hole you need to get your ball into. But this isn’t just any old mini golf course. You can jump over hazards, teleport across courses, and phase through objects to pull off trick shots. The demo includes the game’s first two episodes, which will teach you the ropes before pitting you against a boss to test what you’ve learned.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong></strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3553150/The_Cascadier/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">The Cascadier</a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve ever wondered what would happen if a roguelike deckbuilder collided with a magical coin-pusher machine, The Cascadier has your answer, and it’s gloriously chaotic.<br>Each run has you charging coins with elemental powers from your deck and dropping them into dazzling, pinball-like cabinets that erupt in chain reactions if you drop your coin just right. You’ll be guided by Fortuna, the trickster goddess of luck, and her envious brother Theodan as you chase divine rewards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each round starts with ten coins to drop and your deck of earned abilities. Like any good coin pusher, you’ll scoop up coins mid-round and play them back in to keep your score and ticket count climbing. Run out, and the round’s over, so make every toss count. Hit your score goal to move on, then choose new powersets to add to your growing deck and mix things up in the next run. You’ll spend your hard-earned tickets on upgrading Trinkets that grant new abilities and permanent boosts. The demo lets you try the first cabinet,  a lush, nature-themed machine that hints at the elemental powers each new board will bring.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1075880/Elemental_Brawl/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Elemental Brawl</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A multiplayer party game, Elemental Brawl tasks you with beating up your friends with the power of the elements. Each round begins with everyone only being able to punch and kick, but as time goes on, random elemental orbs will drop. Collecting them grants you powers related to that element, and you can combine elements as the round continues. And the maps aren’t static, you can use your elements to burn them, freeze them, turn puddles into steam traps, and more. It’s all about coming up with creative ways to eliminate your opponents.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2944590/Chowdown_Kitty/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Chowdown Kitty</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A puzzle game with simple yet addictive gameplay, Chowdown Kitty presents you with a board filled with cat treats. Connect matching treats in a string of three or more, and those treats get pulled out and put in a food bowl for a cat. The more treats you manage to string together, the higher your score gets and the happier the cat gets.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/12-free-demos-for-indieio-games-available-now-as-part-of-steam-next-fest-party]]></content:encoded>

It also suggests that Nintendo's attempts at locating the hackers have not been successful — despite an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-requests-subpoena-of-discord-to-track-down-user-behind-last-years-pokemon-teraleak">legal bid by the company to subpoena Discord</a> to divulge the hackers' identity in April this year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's release of hacked Pokémon Legends: Z-A information comes after days of leaks from players with early copies — legitimate and not — that have laid the new game's Pokédex bare, including a long list of fresh Mega Pokémon species.

But as claims of these games' names and settings swirl, it's worth pointing out that this information appears to rely on documentation that's several years' old — rather than actual gameplay footage, as is the case for Pokémon Legends: Z-A. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In October 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-developer-game-freak-reportedly-hacked-stolen-data-on-unannounced-games-as-well-as-nintendo-switch-2-codename-leaked-online">Game Freak issued a statement confirming the company had suffered a data breach</a> in August of that year, and noted that hackers had accessed the details of current and former employees.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/enginefall-is-a-compelling-extraction-shooter-set-on-a-moving-train.1323841/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Enginefall’s greatest strength based on the limited time I had with it is that it doesn’t have that immediate signature identity of survival extraction battle royale-y sorts of games that it resembles on paper. The Tarkov or Fortnite experience might not get you as far as it would out of the gates in other games. This early learning curve comes from equal parts creative systems that create a faster and more dangerous pace than others, but the amount of all the little things you’ll need to learn to make good choices is intimidating. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every run on the Titan Train starts a similar way: raiders, either by themselves or in crews of up to five, start at the back of the colossal city-state on rails. When the timer starts, it's off to the races, each party running, crafting, climbing, and shooting their way to the engine at the front of the train. It’s all very chaotic from start to finish, in ways that are fun and engaging, but also frustrating and confusing.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Enginefall Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My group of five started hot out of the gate filling our pockets with as many scraps of metal and plastic we could find littering the ground, all important resources used to build bases and starting gear. We started with sledgehammers, useful for breaking the plastic off of the long plastic seats installed on the sides of the train, and busting up bundles of ceramic stuff into smaller, more useful pieces. These took more swings than expected to break off completely, but luckily each swing just put a bunch of plastic in your inventory and didn’t confetti to the ground for you to have to scoop up after. I felt extremely exposed breaking down this raw material, and if I didn’t have several people with me, there's no way I wouldn’t have been a victim. Solo players would likely have to approach this initial part more stealthfully, maybe missing out on gearing up early altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our first agenda, plotted by one of my team's developer-sherpas, Shaun “Flak” Stiglingh, was to find a cozy cabin of the train, reinforce the doors, and claim it as our first of likely several forward operating bases where we can store our plunder and upgrade our gear in relative safety. As he organized the resources we had, our second guide, Red Rover Interactive’s CEO Fred Richardson, led the rest of us out to find another good use for our sledgehammers, beating up other raiders and taking their stuff.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, we accumulated enough stuff to get some armor on our bodies and a layout of how the rest of our journey was going to proceed. This didn’t take a long time, and while the crafting menus and systems are pretty straightforward and serviceable, learning how to prioritize what you research and build first to get the best advantage seems like a daunting task only achievable through lots of trial and error. I was happy to let Flak handle it this time, as well as outline our strategy to get to the engine room. In order to get to the front of the train, we have to get keys that give us access to higher-class train cars (we start in 3rd, and need to work through 2nd, 1st, and eventually Conductor classes). We find these keys out there in the train cars we have access to already, be it among scraps, among loot in the assorted boxes tucked in every nook and cranny, or in the pockets of our rival raiders. Luckily, Fred’s previous hammer party produced a 2nd class ticket, so now all we had to do was get to the transfer gate without getting derailed.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Travelling in the rafters high above the main levels of the cars would keep you off of the ground, but the walkways are narrow and one fall would certainly kill you.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">He and Fred decided the best way to go would actually be through the lower decks, mentioning that each train car has several alternative routes that chain to one another, each with their own set of risks and benefits. Travelling in the rafters high above the main levels of the cars would keep you off of the ground, but the walkways are narrow and one fall would certainly kill you. Some cars give you the opportunity to leave the train completely, exposing you to the harsh climate of the wasteland around you, but giving you some deadly shortcuts that would certainly help make up some ground if you can survive it. Similar story with the lower decks, where the exhaust of the train is pumped through. Our path through the cars and up to the 2nd Class section would be more straight forward and hypothetically safer from enemies, but we would all need to acquire gas masks or risk a breathtaking death down below. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With a little more farming of both people and objects, we had the requisite masks. Down we went under the lower tunnels, which as predicted, went rather smoothly. We would have to pop back up to the main level to switch cars every so often, but we took the gassy express lane straight through 3rd Class, and eased into the next zone without many issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2nd Class car is where I found a lot of friction, mostly from the servers themselves. This was a stress test for the Red Rover Interactive, the largest they’d done yet. So I don’t fault them for my fate, which found me rubberbanding in stressful times like firefights and while collecting a treasure trove of goodies from a resource drop that I would eventually die in because I couldn’t tell if the escape I made in my time actually happened in the eyes of my party mates (it didn’t). I spent a good amount of time just unable to do much in the game at all, locked in a death screen while the pandemonium unfolded within earshot. Though I appreciated the opportunity to learn what it was probably like to be one of those ghosts on that train in Final Fantasy 6, it did mean that I missed almost all of the shenanigans that went down in the 2nd Class cars. I was revived and returned to working order eventually, just in time to make a frantic dash to the 1st Class section. Frantic because over time, the lower class cars get sealed off for good, a Fortnite storm ring sort of mechanic that forces all survivors to move up the train or get crushed by the class barriers. Quite the metaphor.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Quite a few interesting happenings occurred to us as we traveled through 1st Class. Initially, we found a train car that was completely exposed, requiring breathing equipment in order to pass through safely. Our early investment in gas masks paid off, but this was not an obstacle I expected to hit, and would have had no answer for if I wasn’t guided by experts. When we got back into a covered car and set up a new base (in a relatively swanky cabin that was pretty large but also had too many doors to feasibly defend for long), we spent far less time shooting at the first people we saw and more time attempting to strike deals with them. There were squads who were already ahead of us making their way into the engine room, and assembling as much resistance as possible against them seemed like a stronger move than attempting to go it alone against a well fortified team with much more of an advantage than us. This is possible, and plausible, because teams who don't steal the train engine’s fuel core can still extract with all of the materials they’ve pilfered and plundered during the run, which can be used to build their own trains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We didn’t see any of this system during our playthrough, but individual players can hoard materials and resources to upgrade their personal safe havens, and eventually pirate their own Marauder trains. According to Red Rover, players can become conductors of these claimed trains, and invite friends to crew it with them. These raiding clans can pool their resources to add cars and all sorts of upgrades to their marauders, but also will be able to use these battle barges to raid other players Marauders as well as the main Titan Train. This sounds like a hectic, somewhat asymmetrical version of Meet Your Maker’s player dungeons, except the dungeons meet on the rails and everyone inside them fights over scraps of toilet bowl. This is also something very much still in development and farther down the roadmap.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/13/second-class-combat-1760372319524.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With a team already fortifying themselves inside the engine room, and a shaky alliance made between us and another hodgepodge raiding party, we pooled our efforts to secure entry to the conductor class car, and had ourselves a tense and awkward stakeout. The group we allied with got taken out by other stragglers before fully crossing into the car, and we were on our own again, building what would be our last base in a car full of verdant greenery and opulence. Here, we attempted to goad the enemy out, sometimes literally Flak and Fred barking insults through the door hoping to annoy them to death. We sort of had them in a hard spot - their only way off of this train should they decide to take the fuel core and bounce was through us. We weren’t exactly safe either, though, as straggling raiders were making their way up to the engine room, effectively pinching us between the conductors and them. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The conductors took advantage of the chaos to add a bit more, by pulling the fuel core and starting a meltdown sequence, filling the car with toxic gas and using all of the bedlam to escape past us.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The stalemate would eventually break after we were forced to turn our attention to the amassing amount of enemies crowding this final car. The conductors took advantage of the chaos to add a bit more, by pulling the fuel core and starting a meltdown sequence, filling the car with toxic gas and using all of the bedlam to escape past us. The clock starts ticking and everyone has the same primary goal now: get the hell off of the train. Practically, this meant a mad dash back several cars to an escape door and through other players who might be more motivated by spite than survival, shooting at anyone who isn’t them in hopes that we have goodies worth keeping as a consolation prize. It was hard to tell in all the desperate running and gunning who extracted and who didn’t. All I know is that we definitely didn’t, missing the chance to blow the train by mere seconds.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/13/conductor-compartment-1760372335722.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Through our session, I got the most mileage out of the snappy shooting and melee combat and tactical navigation decisions, but there are some systems present that never left the station this time around. A contract was started by a player that asked all of the active raiders to choose a side: either to rise up and overthrow the current conductor, or to fight on the conductor’s behalf. The outcome sorts the lobby into two teams and provides an extra reward if one side wins over the other. I wasn’t entirely sure how either team was supposed to do this? Was there a time limit, or a kill threshold? This is something I'm sure the average player would get the hang of after a few games, but I largely ignored this and didn’t feel like I missed anything. There are also some survival elements to contend with, specifically hunger and thirst. I was constantly picking up things that sounded like terrible meals, like roach nests and weird train grown mushrooms, but I died so regularly that I never had to worry about what a pie made of human ears, a more advanced meal option, might taste like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a lot I didn’t see in my first run of Enginefall, from the alternate pathways players can take making every run to the front of the massive Titan Train unique, to the player-driven or environmental events that incentivize raiders to take higher risks for higher rewards. It can be messy to learn and difficult to know how to proceed at first, and the fast pace of this death race makes it impossible to stop and smell the roses for too long, but the fun shooting and looting really has me interested in getting back on the rails when its first public playtest goes live October 24th-26th.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/enginefall-is-a-compelling-extraction-shooter-set-on-a-moving-train]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-10-best-pok%C3%A9mon-spin-off-games.1323835/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When a franchise reaches the hulking size of Pokémon, it finds its way into everything. The Pokémon Company’s games have touched almost every genre, we’ve seen its characters rendered in almost every art style, and we’ve seen them battle a pantheon of gods and monsters. A universe of Pokémon games exists outside of the core series, and this month we’re treated to a new major spin-off from the franchise in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some may bristle at Z-A being labelled as a "spin-off," as developer Game Freak itself considers Legends a "main series". But, for the purpose of simplifying this list, we're considering any game that isn't part of the "core" mainline series (Red and Blue through to Scarlet and Violet) as a spin-off. By moving away from the classic turn-based RPG formula, spin-off games allow us to see different shades of the Pokemon universe and experience it in a new light. While the core Pokémon games can be boiled down to the competitive side of things, they’re also about building an emotional attachment to your team, immersing yourself in this strange, utopic universe and, most importantly, being enchanted by the lore of the world and interacting with myths and legends. The best spin-offs focus on those other aspects and enhance that sense of wonder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Z-A just around the corner, this is the perfect time to celebrate all the different ways the pocket monsters have deviated from their usual turn-based RPG roots, and rank the top 10 Pokémon spin-off games. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Pokémon Ranger</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokemon-ranger-1758899122690.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As already mentioned, the best spin-offs approach Pokémon from a fresh direction. Instead of playing as a trainer, in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-ranger">Pokémon Ranger</a> you’re… well, a Ranger. Your job is essentially taking care of your local community. If a Pokémon is distressed, you’re tasked to calm it down. If one goes missing, you have to go find it. If there’s a fire, you can use a nearby water Pokémon to help put it out. Cute missions like these are strung together in a run, which replicates the sort of little tasks you’d see in cosy games. And they’re funny, too! Pokémon has always been fun, but rarely has it displayed actual comedic chops in the way it does here.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Ranger definitely has its fans, it’s not higher on this list because the missions can get… repetitive. The main gameplay loop is literally about loops – you have to physically draw circles around the Pokémon you want to temporarily capture for each task using the Nintendo DS’ stylus. This has more depth than it sounds, but even the most challenging captures don’t feel completely satisfying. It’s an example of a really fun idea that doesn’t quite fully hold up in execution. Nonetheless, Pokémon Ranger benefits from that funny dialogue and some cool worldbuilding, allowing you to experience the universe from a very different, more vocation-focused perspective.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Pokémon Stadium 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokemon-stadium-2-1758899167584.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">During the Nintendo 64 era, the Pokémon Stadium series was the best visual representation of our beloved little monsters we had in the video games. Taking advantage of Nintendo’s first 3D system, we were treated to detailed, tactile character models and unique attack animations that brought the worlds of the games and the anime as close together as they had ever been. Though lacking in significant story beats for lore-hungry fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-stadium-2">Pokémon Stadium 2</a> in particular was a dream for the most competitive members of the fanbase, offering a myriad of battle formats. It also introduced Earl’s Pokémon Academy, which both taught battle strategies and tested newfound skills. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s more to Stadium 2 than just the stadium itself. Let’s not forget the endlessly entertaining Pokémon mini-games and quizzes of the Kids Club, or the returning magic trick introduced in the first game: importing the exact same Pokemon you had raised in GameBoy games straight into the Nintendo 64. Taking your favourites on a cross-console journey to the big Stadium hit upon one of the core appeals of the series: strengthening the lasting connection you have with these digital creatures. Even as graphics have improved, nothing has compared to the thrill of seeing your original GameBoy starter duke it out on the TV screen for the very first time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Pokémon Colosseum</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokemon-colosseum-1758899251838.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-colosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a> arrived on the GameCube in 2003, it was an important first: finally, a 3D Pokémon game that featured a full storyline. With its double battle format, lack of random encounters, and a compelling plot, it was an exciting evolution beyond Stadium’s battle-focused format. While it’s a similar style of RPG to the classic games, instead of starting out as a young trainer with a level five starter looking to become the Pokémon champion, you’re dropped into the shoes of a more experienced protagonist who uses the decidedly cool (and level 25!) Espeon and Umbreon. Your adventure begins right after escaping from the nefarious Team Snagem with stolen technology, a story set up that, along with a Star Wars-inspired desert community setting, ensures Colosseum occupies its own distinct space in the Pokémon library. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Colosseum was where Shadow Pokémon were first introduced to the franchise. These are Pokémon who have been "closed off from their hearts" and need to be purified before they can properly be used in battle. This system offers a unique slant on Pokémon’s classic collect-and-train gameplay, forcing you to balance levelling up your team with purifying it, too. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokemon-xd-gale-of-darkness-1758899444434.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Improving on the solid foundations of Colosseum, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-xd-gale-of-darkness">Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</a> deepens the lore around Shadow Pokémon and has become a bit of a cult classic amongst fans. It lends new weight to the idea of Shadow Pokémon, explored through the addition of Shadow Lugia – the only pocket monster to get a full, dark redesign, and said to be the ultimate Shadow Pokémon, unable to be purified. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set five years after the events of Colosseum, you’re tasked with taking down the Cipher criminal syndicate and purifying Pokémon across the Orre region. While inheriting Colosseum’s gameplay style, complete with the excellent doubles battle system that brings Pokémon a little closer to feeling like a party-based JRPG, Gale of Darkness differentiates itself from its predecessor by casting you as a rookie trainer. This change means the experience falls more in line with the typical Pokémon journey, which arguably robs the game of a bit of originality. However, the 3D world and continued exploration of the Shadow Pokémon phenomenon makes up for any feeling of repetition, with each new story beat deepening the worldbuilding and adding more layers to the Orre region. All that, in tandem with the excellent battle system and that carefully balanced purification mechanic, makes Gale of Darkness a Pokémon spin-off worth seeking out. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Pokémon Conquest</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokemon-conquest-1758899482446.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Koei Tecmo, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/16/pokemon-conquest-review">Pokémon Conquest</a> is a crossover with the historical Nobunaga’s Ambition franchise, a line of strategy games that have a very different feel to Pokémon. This crossover introduces a variety of elements you’d never expect to see in a Pokémon game, including historical figures from Japan’s Sengoku period, such as daimyō Oda Nobunaga himself. It also combines Pokémon’s traditions with very non-traditional characters, art style, and dialogue. This makes for an unusual game, but it becomes easy to accept such a strange mixture as soon as you jump into a battle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon fits the strategy game genre like a glove. Conquest’s type match-ups, interactive battlefields, and each Pokémon’s hidden abilities all make for a compelling strategy battle system that can, at times, feel even more engaging than the core series’ turn-based combat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Conquest may not scratch the itch of those looking to immerse themselves further in the traditional world of Pokémon, as the game probably takes place in its own universe with its own rules. However, its completely fresh approach makes it a genuinely unique prospect in a franchise that can often fall foul of delivering the same experience over and over again. It’s a real shame that the franchise has never returned to the strategy genre since. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokmon-mystery-dungeon-blue-rescue-team-1758899623507.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">  What better way to immerse yourself into the world of Pokémon than to become one yourself? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-blue-rescue-team">Blue Rescue Team</a> kicks off the Mystery Dungeon sub-series with one of the coolest ideas Pokémon has ever had: What if you played as a human who was transformed into an amnesiac Pokémon and now works as a bounty hunter in a little community, all while attempting to work out how on earth you became a Pokémon to begin with? It’s a completely ridiculous premise, but one that’s endlessly charming in practice. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In some Pokémon games it’s easy to feel as if the story is simply happening around you, rather than you having any agency in it. Blue Rescue Team doesn’t just bring you closer to the mythos of the Pokémon world, it makes you feel like you’re at the very centre of it, with each of your actions crafting new lore that’ll be etched into the history of this world. Its roguelike gameplay sees you explore randomly generated dungeons, rescuing stranded Pokémon, delivering items, and completing other simple tasks. This approach has its merits and faults (and the dungeon crawler design is certainly an acquired taste), but Blue Rescue Team’s story makes up for any shortcomings by being imbued with such a strong sense of wonder. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Pokémon Snap</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokemon-snap-1758899676747.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The great thing about a fictional world as fleshed out as Pokémon’s is that you could be tasked with doing any job and it would still be interesting. Working as a wildlife photographer in the Pokémon universe is a vocation guaranteed to further immerse you in the world, allowing you to get much closer to its magic (thanks to the power of a camera’s zoom) and see Pokemon like you’d never get to see otherwise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By framing its Pokémon as wildlife rather than collectable fuzzy warriors, whose lives are filled with adorable small interactions between each other, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-snap">Snap</a> makes it feel like the world of Pokémon still lives and breathes even after you power down your console. That approach meant Pokémon Snap was a cosy game before cosy games really became a thing, with relaxing gameplay and a calming set of tasks you can tick off in each play session. As is true of real wildlife photography, many of your snaps will be of common creatures you’ve seen dozens of times before. But every now and then your camera lens will catch a rare glimpse of a legendary or mythical Pokémon, which immediately evokes that sense of wonder that powers the best games in the franchise. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Pokémon Go</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokemon-go-1758899752065.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s become a meme to say that the summer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> dropped was the closest we ever got to world peace, but the fact this simple augmented reality mobile game became as ubiquitous as it did is a testament to something only this franchise could do. Any adult Pokémon fan will tell you that, if a genie came to them as a child, their number one wish would be for Pokémon to be real. Go is the closest we’ll get to that, barring any Jurassic Park-style scientific abominations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">An incredible idea that could only be realised through mobile phones, Niantic’s pioneering design sees you explore your actual surroundings in search of digital Pokemon, which can then be battled at virtual gyms that are linked to real-world locations. Its physical requirements – you actually have to walk around to find randomly-spawning new Pokémon – genuinely manifests the adventurous spirit of Pokémon in your own neighborhood. It is wish fulfillment for those who dreamt about running around catching Pokémon, building a connection with these creatures, and exploring the world around you with wide-eyed wonder. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mobile gaming comes with so much baggage, often representing the worst of the gaming industry, but Pokémon Go is its most pure innovation.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of the Sky</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokmon-mystery-dungeon-explorers-of-the-sky-1758899801288.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mystery Dungeon sub-series has evolved over the years, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-explorers-of-sky">Explorers of Sky</a> is one of the best examples of how it's improved and expanded. An enhanced version of 2007’s Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness, it takes everything that makes the Mystery Dungeon series great, combines it with one of the best stories the franchise has seen, and adds a number of much-appreciated quality of life improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite starting with a familiar premise (you’re once again a human-turned-Pokémon),<strong> </strong>Explorers of Sky quickly morphs into a time-bending tale, true to the new lore introduced in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. It’s a story that actually showcases the mystical abilities of the world’s legendary creatures, rather than leaving them as descriptions in a Pokédex entry. And while this story is mostly a retread of Explorers of Time, five new Special Episodes enhance the tale with additional storylines that explore the lives of side characters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of the feelings we associate with a good Pokémon game are successfully evoked here, right down to your partner genuinely feeling like your best friend. Mystery Dungeon excels here because your partner Pokémon is someone you can actually speak to, and that communication really cements your bond. When the credits roll, you really feel like you’ve gone through something life-changing together, a feeling many Pokémon games try to create but don’t always succeed at. The Mystery Dungeon games offer a peek into the Pokémon world unlike any other strand of the franchise, and this is the best of them. We’re way overdue a new one, and this is the one to beat. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Pokémon Legends: Arceus</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-1758899857149.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Lifelong Pokémon fans will forever be chasing the high of booting up Legends: Arceus for the first time. The opening cutscene sees you meet Arceus, the Pokémon god himself, before being plunged back in time to the ancient Sinnoh region. But the moment that really sets fireworks off in your brain is the instant you take control of your character and throw a Poké Ball. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Legends: Arceus is the first “Open Zone” game in Pokémon history, and that new approach to world design made it feel like the franchise had finally been unshackled from the classic-formula mainline games, which had become increasingly restrictive since they transitioned to 3D. Having the freedom to run up to a Pokémon in the overworld and capture them without having to endure multiple battle turns felt like tasting seasoned food after years of eating only boiled chicken. Legends: Arceus’ modernised design makes for the most satisfying and immersive gameplay loop the Pokémon series has ever had, and that’s paired with dozens of captivating lore revelations. Your task in Legends: Arceus is to construct the first ever Pokédex, to use the first ever Poké Balls, and create the bond between man and monster that forms the basis of every other game in the series – it’s a prequel to the entire franchise, and just as brilliant as such a position would demand. With a wondrous setting and compelling gameplay, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> is the very best, like no spin-off ever was. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And those are our picks for the 10 best Pokémon spin-off games.
