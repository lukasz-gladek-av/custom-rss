"If you follow, you're going to watch an old guy work out. That's all it is. My plan is to get ripped, though. You can do it with me if you want."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/09/gettyimages-2179647401-1733752045687.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Red Dead Redemption actor Rob Wiethoff.

"I am not certified or even trained in any kind of physical training nor am I an educated or certified dietician," Wiethoff said on his OnlyFans page. "If you decide to do what I do and eat what I eat, that’s up to you. I’m certainly not asking for you to do either of those things or even suggesting that you do. This is for fun. I hope we all enjoy it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His first post on OnlyFans asked fans if they're ready for it, and if he's ready for it. Wiethoff's second and latest post chronicles his water drinking philosophy for the day while explaining his eating habits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The actor plays one of the most iconic roles in video games as the protagonist of Red Dead Redemption and a main character of its sequel, both of which have gone down among the greatest games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-review">In our 10/10 review of the second</a>, IGN said: "Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open-world ode to the outlaw era."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

The <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013590" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Store page</a> also features fake selling points and even fake awards from video game websites, including IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Most Anticipated Game About Making The Most Anticipated Game!” reads the game page. “You're now in charge of the biggest gaming disaster... Or masterpiece? Run your dream game studio while juggling angry fans, corporate chaos, and endless delays. Fight your way through gaming conventions, dodge ruthless journalists, and master the art of creative excuses.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/09/gta-1733750215619.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grand Taking Ages VI is meant to be a parody of GTA 6. Image credit: PlayStation Store.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Taking Ages VI is supposedly inspired by real gaming industry events, and “delivers a satirical take on game development and the endless wait for certain highly anticipated titles.” It promises a release before October 2025, or before when the developer expects Grand Theft Auto 6 to come out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of the developer, the PlayStation Store page mentions Violarte sp. z o. O., which appears to be a Polish company. The website for Violarte was only created recently, and contains fake games and awards as well as what look like fake employees visualized either with stock photos or generative AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Sony and Violarte for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Grand Taking Ages VI should obviously not be taken seriously, its appearance on the PlayStation Store does call into question Sony’s curation process. The PlayStation Store has seen a number of questionable games over the years, but all the major video game storefronts struggle with this issue. The likes of Steam, the various app stores, and even the Nintendo eShop are packed with slop. And who can forget God of War rip-off War Gods Zeus of Child, which appeared on the Xbox store back in 2022?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Grand Taking Ages VI, its appearance on the PlayStation Store is likely not long for this world. “In memory of those who didn't have a chance to live till this moment (and those who gave up waiting and bought a PS6 instead),” the description concludes. “PS6 doesn't exist yet, but by the time some games release, it probably will.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6, meanwhile, launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S in the fall of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
