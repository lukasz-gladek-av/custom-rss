The PlayStation reference, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-and-website-still-lists-release-date-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s-with-no-mention-of-pc">the trailer notice confirming the footage was entirely captured on PS5</a>, has some wondering whether Sony has signed a co-marketing deal with Rockstar for the promotion of GTA 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The GTA series was once inexorably linked to PlayStation, and Rockstar and Sony have done deals like this before. GTA 6, which is expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time, would certainly be an aggressive marketing move from Sony, but you can imagine itâ€™s hoping GTA 6 sells the PS5 Pro in huge numbers in time for the May 2026 release date. Assuming we donâ€™t see a PC release at the same time as console, PS5 Pro will be the most powerful platform for what is expected to be the best-selling game of all time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, fans are having fun with this PlayStation nod in the GTA 6 trailer, with some joking that itâ€™s an early look at the PS6.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="fr" dir="ltr">Rockstar Games leak la PS6 dans le second trailer de GTA VI. ðŸ‘½ <a href="https://t.co/liBCpDFJQX" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/liBCpDFJQX</a></p>â€” PXL (@MisterPXL) <a href="https://twitter.com/MisterPXL/status/1919760323231219787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"GTA 6 playable within GTA 6 before GTA 6," joked redditor WillyPepper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are wondering if previous GTA games will be playable within GTA 6 in a nod to Rockstar's past, perhaps as one of the many mini-games. "Imagine they just casually put in GTA 4 remaster as a playable mini game," wondered Crazy-Path-7929. "What are the chances we get Vice City emulated in game?" asked PastorPoppyseed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Weâ€™ve got plenty more on GTA 6 Trailer 2, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-70-brand-new-screenshots-reveal-the-characters-and-places-of-leonida">70 brand new GTA 6 screenshots</a>, confirmation of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-song">the trailerâ€™s song</a>, and much more analysis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
