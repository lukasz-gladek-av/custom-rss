            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-shows-remakes-could-be-key-to-bethesda-getting-back-on-track<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">By Azura, by Azura, by Azura – the rumors were true. Yesterday, Bethesda set the internet on fire by finally pulling back the curtain on Virtuos’ remaster (or is it really a remake?) of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-finally-revealed-in-first-look-gameplay-and-its-out-today">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>. An ‘Elder Scrolls Direct’ of sorts culminated in the surprise shadow-drop, which near-immediately transformed into hundreds of thousands of concurrent players. This moment of global hype and celebration feels like a much-needed port in the current storm Bethesda Game Studios has been facing in recent years. From conducting years-long damage control to rectify Fallout 76’s misfire launch, to the lackluster reception of its new sci-fi universe, Starfield, the studio’s most recent output has had many fans asking the same question: Has Bethesda lost the magic? There’s fiercer competition in the RPG space these days, with Larian Studios’ Baldur’s Gate 3 and Obsidian’s The Outer Worlds franchise both garnering critical acclaim as Elder Scrolls and Fallout spiritual successors. But while Elder Scrolls 6 and Fallout 5 may be years away from reclaiming their crowns, this re-release of Oblivion may be a step in the right direction – just not in the direction you’d expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At its peak, Bethesda Game Studios was an RPG juggernaut. In 2020, Microsoft’s <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/fallout-4-has-shipped-25-million-units-as-of-2020-as-per-leaked-microsoft-documents" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaked FTC documents</a> revealed that Fallout 4 had sold 25 million units-to-date. The game shifted over 5 million units in its first week alone according to <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/262199/fallout-4-sells-an-estimated-519m-first-week-at-retail/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGChartz</a>. Likewise, in 2023 Todd Howard announced Skyrim had crossed <a href="https://in.ign.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/186698/news/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-has-sold-over-60-million-copies-globally" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">60 million sales</a> (though it’s worth noting rereleasing it 50 times likely helped). So what about Starfield? Estimates put it at just over <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/guides/starfield-how-many-copies-sold/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three million units</a> a year-and-a-half post launch. While taking into account Game Pass subscribers (which would boost players if not sales) and Starfield’s lack of a PlayStation presence, this must still be something of a disappointment for Bethesda. And while there <em>is</em> a Starfield fanbase, it’s far smaller than that enjoyed by The Elder Scrolls or Fallout, and even it has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-design-director-addresses-fan-concern-as-starfield-dlc-shattered-space-plunges-to-mostly-negative-steam-review-rating">voiced displeasure</a> with the game’s first expansion, Shattered Space. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This all leaves the developer with a big problem. With The Elder Scrolls 6 <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-out-of-pre-production-but-pete-hines-says-it-will-be-years-before-we-start-hearing-about-it/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“years away”</a> and Fallout 5 just a whisper in the hallowed halls of the studio’s corridors, how can this once-iconic RPG developer enchant their fanbase once more? The answer lies in its past.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rumours of the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster began back in September 2023, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document">leaked Microsoft documents</a> revealed a number of unannounced Bethesda titles, including a remaster of 2006’s landmark trip to Tamriel (it also includes another interesting remaster –  we’ll get to that soon). All was quiet until January 2025, when a former employee of Virtuos <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-reportedly-leak-online">let slip more details</a>, dividing Elder Scrolls fans as to their authenticity like the Stormcloaks vs. the Imperials. Finally, last week the dam broke (albeit early), setting the internet ablaze – there were over 6.4 million Google searches for ‘The Elder Scrolls VI: Oblivion’, rising by 713% in the last week alone. At its peak, Bethesda’s reveal livestream had over half a million viewers watching. Despite the leaks (or perhaps because of them), <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y42wvjrd3o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 600,000 people</a> tuned in to see a 19-year-old game re-revealed to them. The intense fervent demand to play the remaster caused discount game key websites like <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/the-oblivion-remaster-is-already-discounted-but-its-so-popular-its-crashing-deal-websites" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDKeys to crash</a>, and slowed Fanatical and Green Man Gaming to a crawl. As of yesterday, Steam’s concurrent players stood at 125,000 and the game is firmly the #1 best seller. The enthusiasm Bethesda fans have for Oblivion burns as bright as the flames that spill from the Oblivion gates themselves.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>How can this once-iconic RPG developer enchant their fanbase once more? The answer lies in its past.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The message from players is clear: if you (re)build it, they will come. What better way to keep fans engaged and invested during these long development periods than to invite them to take a trip back to the mysterious isles of Morrowind or the hollowed-out husk of the East Coast? From a commercial standpoint, it makes clear sense. While Bethesda’s main development staff toils away on long-gestating new projects, trusted partners like Virtuos can use historic blueprints to craft remasters in shorter time frames. Such remasters are based on games with built-in audiences, and for many they’re the first real RPGs gamers will have sunk their teeth into during their respective generations. Restoring these works also invites a whole new generation to become obsessed with the inner workings of the land of Tamriel or crawl out from the post-apocalyptic fallout into Las Vegas and D.C. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda has already strategically uplifted its own catalogue once before. Fallout 4 was discounted by up to 75% during the Fallout TV show’s first season on Prime Video, alongside a cleverly scheduled next-gen update which brought over certain homages from the show. As a result, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-4-sales-top-ten-europe">Fallout 4 sales jumped over 7,500% in Europe</a> alone despite being nearly a decade old.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/oblivion-1745334385008.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Oblivion Remastered offers a visit to the past that looks like the future. Image credit: Bethesda / Virtuos</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking back to Microsoft’s leaked Bethesda roadmap, many noted that a Fallout 3 remaster was listed to follow Oblivion two years later. It’s important to note the timelines from this original presentation have shifted – Oblivion was originally cited as fiscal year 2022. However, assuming these original gaps remain true, it appears a Fallout 3 remake could be on the cards for 2026 – just in time for Fallout Season 2, coincidentally. While a Fallout remaster seems inevitable now, given the second series’ shift to New Vegas, could it be possible that Bethesda’s early conversations with showrunners Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet mean that a surprise New Vegas remake could be in store? Given the synchronicity of the show’s first season to Fallout 4’s vibe and aesthetic, could Bethesda level-up its craftiness even more for the upcoming New Vegas-centric second season? It shadow-dropped Oblivion – it’s not out of the realm of possibility that a New Vegas Remastered trailer is lying in wait for us at the end of Fallout Season 2’s finale.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The message from players is clear: if you (re)build it, they will come. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However, if there’s one game in Bethesda’s back catalogue that deserves to be remade the most, it’s undeniably The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. Many Elder Scrolls fans have spent years fus-ro-dahing on the mountaintop for this, with one group of superfans going as far as to <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/the-elder-scrolls-morrowind-remake-074606-20240502" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remake Morrowind using Skyrim’s tools</a>, ala Skyblivion. However, Morrowind is not as easy a game to remake as Oblivion. It sits on the precipice between Bethesda’s evolutions as a studio – it is literally built differently to our modern understanding of an Elder Scrolls game. It’s only partially voiced, most of the story is told through text, there are no quest markers (players must literally write down directions given by NPCs, save for those with perfect memories), and combat physics are non-existent. Whereas Virtuos was able to overhaul some of the more finicky systems of Oblivion, the entirety of Morrowind <em>is</em> a finicky system. It’s why many love the game, but it’s also why it’s difficult to remake. To remake Morrowind is a dangerous tightrope. Modernize it too much and you risk losing the magic it was originally imbued with. Leave too many antiquated systems in place, and it’ll feel worse than an almighty skooma hangover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When a studio becomes the icon of a gaming sub-genre, the challenge is this: how do you innovate and evolve whilst holding onto your audience? Rockstar Games has kept Grand Theft Auto players satisfied for over a decade through the ever-expanding multiplayer world of GTA Online, which in turn fuels the eye-wateringly expensive rumored budget for GTA 6. Bethesda’s bread-and-butter is richly detailed, expansive worlds that are resolutely single-player – Elder Scrolls Online and Fallout 76 just don’t hit in the same way. However, what’s clear through the overwhelming response to Virtuos’ Oblivion remaster is that gamers are more than on-board to dive back into the historic annals of Elder Scrolls of years-gone-by. That’s not to say any remaster is a slam dunk – this particular one is a clear product of careful consideration and skilled development, and a lesser game may have garnered a very different response, ala Rockstar’s own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-review">GTA Definitive Editions</a> – but what better way for the former king of the modern RPG to get back on track than to breathe new life into some old classics?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Sab Astley is a freelance writer who has written for IGN, Polygon, TotalFilm, Rolling Stone, Radio Times, and Metro UK.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Oblivion, which first launched in 2006, was one of the chief culprits, with objects flying all over the place, characters making poorly-timed (but often hilarious) on-screen interjections, and <em>things </em>happening in the background that, in the context of what was going on in the foreground, were perfect meme material.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly 20 years later, and Bethesda’s remaster (not a remake, it’s insisted), has all the “charm,” of the original, as Todd Howard put it. And that’s not an issue. In fact, it’s quite the opposite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Oblivion is back,” is what players of the remaster are saying in response to clips of the game going wrong in some way, or doing that Bethesda game thing of having a random NPC's face steal the scene.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even glitches players exploited in the original Oblivion have been found to work in the remaster.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The permanent bound weapons and armour glitch still works in Oblivion Remastered LMAO <a href="https://t.co/Nzp8gCAucK" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Nzp8gCAucK</a></p>— Nerbit (@Nerbit_13098) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nerbit_13098/status/1914780386648809874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">And players are recreating Oblivion memes, trying to recapture the hilarity of the game’s NPC behavior as it was all those years ago.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Original for comparison <a href="https://t.co/egYXGxe438" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/egYXGxe438</a></p>— crobb 🌹 (@corombb) <a href="https://twitter.com/corombb/status/1914864882232475829?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">None of Oblivion Remastered’s jank is seriously affecting player enjoyment of the game. For some it offers a warm familiarity. Can you imagine if the game had stripped all this out? It would feel… soulless, somehow, and nothing like the original fans fondly remember. Perhaps such attention on polish is best reserved for The Elder Scrolls VI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bugs, glitches, and memes are just one aspect of Oblivion Remastered’s success, which has seen players use the character creator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remastereds-funny-character-faces-are-going-viral-for-being-total-nightmare-fuel-and-for-looking-like-the-original-fallout-talking-heads">to come up with some hilarious and nightmarish faces</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-starter-pokemon-from-each-generation.1171344/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-starter-pokemon-from-each-generation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The most pivotal moment in any Pokemon game comes right at the start – choosing your partner Pokemon. The first moment you lock eyes with the creature you’ll spend tens of hours raising, bonding with and sending into battle is a special experience. That decision is usually based on vibes and taste to the point where many fans see it as a personality test. However, in those moments, you have no knowledge of how that decision will affect your journey to becoming a Pokemon master, with the gyms, rivals and secrets of the region yet to reveal themselves to you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, we’ve done the research, looked into the base stats, found every strength and weakness of every starter Pokemon and all their evolutions and pitted them against their native regions to determine who is the best starter pick, not just to get you past the first couple gyms, but to take on the Elite Four and beyond. This is the first step to becoming a Pokemon master across all iterations.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 1: Bulbasaur</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-bulbasaurpng-1745318747449.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While being the obvious pick to tackle the first gym in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-red-version">Pokemon Red</a> and Blue (Grass beats Rock, as any Pokemon fan knows), Bulbasaur outshines both Charmander and Squirtle as  the best starter pick in any bid to dominate the Kanto region. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Initial analysis might understandably lean towards Charmander. Fire types are a minority in Gen 1, many random encounters pitt you against Flying types (which are strong against Bulbasaur’s Grass) and the final gym is heavy on Ground types – something Charizard is immune to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, those who are Bulbasaur-inclined will find themselves flying through the majority of the game, with the Grass type being super effective against Brock’s Rock Pokemon, Misty’s Water collection, and the Giovanni’s final gym line-up, as well as being the best choice to take out the first two members of the Elite Four. The biggest challenge Bulbasaur will face are Erika’s Grass type gym, where strategy will be vital to overcoming the barrage of “not very effective” attacks, and Blaine’s Fire type gym, which can be defeated thanks to the abundance of water types present in Kanto. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some issues a Bulbasaur trainer will have to contend with, not least the many Pidgeys and Spearows you’ll come across in tall grass, whose Flying typing will provide a problem for anyone looking to grind their way to a high level. Thankfully, the amount of Ground and Rock types in caves will provide ample opportunity for Bulbasaur to wipe out entire bloodlines of Pokemon to gain a few XP. Also problematic are the frequent encounters with Blue, whose Pidgeot and Charmander will be a consistent issue, the latter of which can be helped by a Water type on your team. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Bulbasaur, along with having well-balanced base stats, has the added bonus of evolving into Venasaur who also is a poison-type, giving him a solid advantage over the other two offerings from Professor Oak.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 2: Cyndaquil</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-cyndaquil-1745320920819.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-gold-version">Pokemon Gold</a> and Silver introduced just eight new Fire types to the series, in comparison to 10 Grass and 18 Water types. That minority means snapping up a powerful Fire Pokemon like Cyndaquil from the start adds a great deal of diversity to your team. More importantly, Cyndaquil proves to be the best matchup for the majority of gyms and Elite Four members that populate Johto. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bugsy’s (you guessed it) Bug type gym and Jasmine’s Steel type gym will easily fall before a few Embers and Flame Wheels from Cyndaquil and his subsequent evolutions. The same cannot be said for the cutest of the starters, Water type Totodile, with there being no Fire, Ground or Rock gyms for him to dismantle. Grass type Chikorita (or more likely her third form, Meganium) would have a field day in Pryce’s Water gym but would struggle with the early Bug and Flying type gyms as well as Morty’s Poison type gym. Pryce will pose a problem for Cyndaquil, and so you’ll want to put together a well-balanced team to get you through that penultimate gym, but you’ll have many hours to assemble the perfect group before that hurdle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also working in Cyndaquil’s favour are the Grass and Bug types dotted throughout the Elite Four’s roster. Though all four of these teams are well-balanced enough to give you trouble no matter who you pick as a starter, the many Poison types and Lance’s team of Dragon/Flying types makes this a no-go zone for Meganium. Meanwhile Totodile’s final evolution, Ferligator, would certainly hold its own against many of these Pokemon, but won’t blaze through a few like Typhlosion will. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Picking Cyndaquil does come with its issues. There will be many Rock and Ground Pokemon bothering you with random encounters in caves and Lance’s team containing a Charizard and a Gyrados will require some solid strategy to overcome, but the effects of these are much lesser compared to what ails Chikorita and Totodile. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 3: Mudkip</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-mudkip-1745320946409.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You might pick Mudkip because you just think he’s neat, but the reasons to go Water type for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-ruby-version">Pokemon Ruby</a> and Sapphire run a bit deeper. In terms of gyms, Water type Mudkip has a bit of competition from the Grass type Treecko as both of them are super effective against three of the eight. They both have an advantage in Roxanne’s and Tate &amp; Liza’s Rock/Ground gyms, while Mudkip will be best suited to take on Flannery’s Fire gym and Treeko for Wallace’s Water gym. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the time you get to Wallace, Treeko would have almost definitely evolved into Sceptile, as Sootopolis City houses the final gym. The significance of that can’t be understated, but Treeko’s Grass typing sees it at a disadvantage in battles with Flannery and with Winona’s Flying type lineup. Mudkip, on the other hand, will struggle with just the one gym – Wattson’s (you guessed it) Electric type gym early on in Mauville City. Your third option, Torchic, doesn’t really enter the conversation here, with Fire types being super effective against none of the gyms and Fighting (a type gained by Torchic’s third form, Blazicken), only super effective against one, not to mention being at a massive disadvantage for Wallace’s battle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The makeup of the Elite Four can lend a slight advantage towards Treeko’s final form, Sceptile, as you come across Glacia’s Ice/Water Pokemon and a few Grass Pokemon along the way which will cause Swampert (Mudkip’s third evolution) some issues. However, as Mudkip evolves into its final form, it gains Ground typing and very nicely balanced stats which see it gain a huge defensive boost, becoming immune to Electric and its only weakness being Grass. This makes Swampert able to power through battles where it usually might be the underdog. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another consideration may be the amount of water present in the Hoenn region, meaning random encounters can be a bit of a grind, but Mudkip shows enough advantages in other areas to overcome that obstacle. Bonus points for being the cutest of the bunch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 4: Chimchar</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-chimchar-1745320985367.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Continuing the trend from the very first game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-diamond-version">Pokemon Diamond</a> and Pearl adds far fewer Fire type Pokemon to the series; just five in comparison to the14 introduced for Water and Grass. Though this isn’t a deciding factor in which starter to pick, it adds to the list of attributes going in Fire type Chimchar’s favour over Grass type Turtwig and Water type Piplup. Three is the magic number in terms of how many gyms a Pokemon needs to be super effective against to come out on top over its peers, and Chimchar’s Fire typing helps it overcome Gardenia’s Grass type gym, as well as the sixth and seventh gyms ran by Byron’s Steel types and Candice’s Ice types. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chimchar faces tough competition from Turtwig, who can eliminate Roark’s Rock type and Crasher Wake’s Water type gyms with ease. After evolving into Torterra, it also gains Ground typing, making it immune to Electric attacks which will see it waltz through the final gym owned by Volkner. Though they may seem perfectly matched, a lot of Turtwig’s strengths are most exemplified in the early stages of the game, while Chimchar’s abilities sees him primed for late game success.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming through the gyms with minimal fuss is important due to the Sinnoh region’s very well-balanced Elite Four. Chimchar’s final evolution, Infernape, is perfect to take on Aaron’s Bug Pokemon, which would be super effective against Torterra, but the Grass type would admittedly be best to dismantle Bertha’s Water and Ground types. Piplup, despite evolving into the very resilient Empoleon, doesn’t have a significant advantage over many of the gym leaders or the Elite Four to make a dent here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a close matchup between Chimchar and Torterra, but due to the frequent battles with Team Galactic’s Bug types, the advantage falls with Chimchar, who has the gym battle credentials to back it up. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 5: Tepig</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-tepig-1745321009249.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Gen 5 makes for a more clean cut decision, with the Fire type Tepig making the biggest claim for being the smartest pick. Grass type Snivy doesn’t quite make the cut as it only has an advantage over just the one gym, nor any significant advantages over any Elite Four member, as well as being plagued by the various Bug and Flying types across the Unova region’s tall grass and boss battles. Water type Oshawott isn’t as embattled as Snivy, being the best choice to take on Clay’s Ground type gym and being resistant to Brycen’s Ice Pokemon, which are super effective against Snivy. But like the Grass type, there are no Elite Four members who lean into a type specifically tailored to Oshawott or its evolutions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Tepig’s Fire abilities, and its final form, Emboar, also being a Fighting type, allows it to have a smoother ride through Unova. Firstly, Burgh’s Bug gym and Brycen’s gym are light work for a Fire type, the latter being the penultimate gym in the game. Alternative solutions will need to be found to make it through Clay’s Ground-based gym, but the same can be said for Oshawott as it arrives in Elesa’s Electric gym. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elite Four battles are where Emboar’s Fighting type comes in handy, being super effective against Grimsley’s Dark type Pokemon. Emboar is admittedly vulnerable to Caitlin’s Psychic types, but if you have a strong enough bench, this battle can easily be overcome. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also working in Emboar’s favour are his strong attacking stats and the presence of Team Plasma, who have an abundance of Steel types. Having to fight the Elite Four twice makes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-black-version">Pokemon Black</a> and White a tough challenge no matter who you choose, but Tepig can put your mind at ease more often than the others. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 6: Fennekin</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-fennekin-1745321043423.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-x-version">Pokemon X</a> and Y continue the dominance of Fire types in this list. The sixth generation has a quirk where you can choose from two sets of starters, first between the new bunch of Chespin, Fennekin and Froakie, and later between the Kanto starters from the original games. For this list, we’ll focus on the starters unique to this game, of which Fennekin is the standout. The Fire Pokemon can almost stroll through the gyms, being super effective against three and resistant to two more. Though two of those gyms are in the early stages of the game, the final three being Fairy, Psychic and Ice based means that Fennekin’s third evolution, Delphox, now imbued with Psychic typing, can head off to the Pokemon League relatively unscathed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Froakie evolves into Greninja, a Water/Dark type Pokemon, making it super effective against Olympia’s Psychic team but weak against Valerie’s Fairy types. Being a Water type mostly gets it into trouble, matching up poorly against Ramos’ Grass types and Clemont’s Electric types, something Grant’s early Rock gym doesn’t make up for. Chespin’s story makes for similar reading, struggling off the bat with Viola’s Bug gym and going on to gain a Fighting typing after evolving into Chesnaught which leaves it at a disadvantage against Olmpia and Valerie. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the games progress, the Elite Fours get a bit more balanced. Pokemon X and Y is another example of a series of battles suited to a different type each time. You’ll want Water to overcome Malva, Fire to overcome Wikstrom and Grass to overcome Siebold. Delphox just about has the edge, able to resist whatever Diantha’s Gardevoir throws at it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 7: Litten</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-litten-1745321072999.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out this Fire type four-peat is Litten from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-sun-version">Pokemon Sun</a> and Moon. Despite having to struggle through the first couple trials (the Alola region’s version of gyms, of which there are only seven), Litten is the obvious choice for the rest of the battles. Mallow’s Grass trial is the only lineup where each Pokemon is weak to Fire, but Sophocles’ Electric gym contains two Steel types and a Bug type. And by the time you arrive at Acerola’s Ghost trial you could have evolved Litten into the Fire/Dark type Incineroar whose attacks will be super effective against the whole lineup, especially the Grass and Ice Pokemon in Acerola’s team. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final trial, in which you must face Mina with her Fairy Pokemon, is a little more complicated because of Incineroar’s Dark typing. A regular Fire type would be able to resist Fairy attacks, but Incineroar is damaged normally by them. Helpfully, Mina has a Steel, Grass and Bug type in her team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Litten’s starter counterparts, Rowlet and Popplio, will find success with one of the first three trials, but will cease to have an advantage over any of the late game battles. Rowlet’s evolution, Decidueye, gains Ghost typing, which is a blessing and a curse for Acerola’s trial, but doesn’t garner much of an advantage elsewhere. Popplio evolves into the Water/Fairy type Primarina, but that doesn’t affect its fortunes with the trials at all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sun and Moon’s Elite Four are just a small fraction of what awaits you in the Pokemon League. After becoming champion yourself, you face challenges from 10 more trainers looking to take your place. These battles, on top of the Elite Four themselves, are too diverse for any starter to have any advantage over the other, meaning Litten’s ability to clear the trials is even more vital. The Alola region also introduces just eight Fire Pokemon in comparison to Grass and Water’s 13 (after the series had become more balanced in that regard) so snapping Litten up early is a great aid.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 8: Sobble</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-sobble-1745321095167.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Sobble’s victory over Grookey and Scorbunny might be the closest of the lot. All three Pokemon are the best picks against three gyms, with Gordie and Raihan’s Rock and Ground gyms being perfect for Sobble and Grookey, and Melony’s Ice gym and Opal’s Fairy gym being tailor made for Scorbunny. Additionally, the first three gyms are Grass, Water and Fire typed, in that order, lending no advantage to any of the three starters. Raihan’s gym being the final one gives it a bit more importance, so the gym battles give a hair’s breadth of a lead to Grookey and Sobble. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Galar region’s version of the Elite Four, The Champion Cup, allows Sobble to just inch past Grookey in the standings. None of these Pokemon’s final evolutions gain any new types, making them work with what they’re given from the start. The semi-final opponents don’t lean any particular way, but Bede's Fairy Pokemon, followed by Nessa’s Water types and Raihan’s Fire and Ground heavy Dragon team, favour Fire, Grass and Water respectively. If success against the toughest opponents is most valued, then Sobble just about edges victory here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other considerations like the rivals, Team Yell, and random encounters are even less impactful than normal in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-sword">Pokemon Sword</a> and Shield. Team Yell uses mostly Dark types, which attack and defend normally against Fire, Water and Grass types, and the introduction of overworld Pokemon means random encounters happen less. If there’s any other factor that tips the scales towards Sobble, it would be that its final evolution, Inteleon, has a nicely balanced set of stats. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 9: Fuecoco</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-fuecoco-1745321116725.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The sixth Fire type to be chosen on this list is one of the clearest winners. You might think that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-scarlet">Pokemon Scarlet</a> and Violet’s focus on player freedom might allow for little separation between Sprigatito, Fuecoco and Quaxly – You can do the gyms and raid Team Star bases in any order you like and you can avoid encounters with wild Pokemon almost entirely. But even with all of that, the Paldea region feels designed to be dominated by Fuecoco. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gyms in Scarlet and Violet don’t level scale, so if you have a bad matchup, you can just return once you’re able to power through a disadvantage. Still, the highest level gyms being Psychic/Fairy and Ice types, courtesy of Tulip and Grusha, and the two lowest level gyms being Katy and Brassius’ Bug and Grass types, means there’s a good reason to go with Fuecoco (and its Ghost type final evolution, Skeledirge) regardless of your strategy. Being a water type, Quaxly isn’t strong against any gym until it reaches its third form, Quaquaval, where it becomes a Fighting type, helping it in Larry’s Normal type gym. Sprigatito fares a bit better, evolving into Grass/Dark type Meowscarada, enabling it to best Tulip’s gym and Ryme’s Ghost gym. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Team Star base raids place even more importance on what starter you pick, being vital to the story progression of the game. The crews based around Dark and Poison Pokemon have an abundance of Bug Pokemon who have to be cleared before you can face the boss, while crews based around Fairy and Fighting types are perfect for Skeledirge, who is immune to attacks from the latter. Quaquaval and Meowscarada are worthy opponents for the first member of the Elite Four, Rika and her Ground Pokemon, but from Poppy’s Steel team onwards, Skeledirge finds itself miles ahead of the competition. </p><div id="the-best-starter-pokemon" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Best Starter Pokemon</h3><h3>The Best Starter Pokemon</h3></p></div></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It includes three promo foil cards (Charizard ex, Charmander, and Charmeleon) a detailed Charizard figure, and 10 booster packs. That’s solid value, and it’s all bundled in a way that makes sense for collectors or players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At under $50, it’s hard to argue with the appeal. The Charizard line has always been popular, and the cards in this set are exclusive promos that won’t be around forever. I think this is an easy pickup if you’re looking to build your collection or just want something that looks great out of the box.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-151-single-card-crash"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG 151 Single Card Crash">Pokémon TCG 151 Single Card Crashes</h2></p><div catalogid="e029409f-0020-43ce-95ac-88650ab348d6" id="219123"><div id="219123" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG 151 Single Card Crashes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been tracking the Pokémon 151 singles for a while, and a few prices have finally started to slide into that sweet spot between “collectible” and “still reasonable.” Blastoise ex (Illustration Rare) is sitting around <strong>$66</strong>, and Venusaur ex is close behind at <strong>$60</strong>. Even Charizard ex, in Secret Rare form, has dipped to around <strong>$39</strong>, which is surprising considering how popular it is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re trying to complete the set or build out Gen 1-themed pages, now’s a good time to grab singles like Charmander, Bulbasaur, or Squirtle for under <strong>$40</strong>. Most of these aren’t meta-competitive, but they’re stunning in a binder and full of nostalgia. I think this wave of price dips won’t last long once more collectors start closing out their sets.</p></div><p id="lossless-scaling"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lossless Scaling">Lossless Scaling</h2></p><div catalogid="e029409f-0020-43ce-95ac-88650ab348d6" id="219125"><div id="219125" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lossless Scaling</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked this up to test on a few older games, and it’s now something I install by default on my ROG Ally X. It lets you scale windowed games to fullscreen without that soft blur you get from built-in GPU scaling. There are a bunch of algorithms to pick from depending on the style of game: FSR, integer scaling, even Anime4K.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve got a handheld like the ROG Ally or a modest desktop setup, this is the kind of quiet upgrade that makes a difference. It doesn’t try to do too much. What it does, it does really well. Easily worth it if you play anything retro or experimental. Whilst it's not reccomended, I've had some very interesting results running this alongside XeSS AI Image upscalling (Stay tuned for a guide on that one).</p></div><p id="tes-iv-oblivion-remastered"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TES IV: Oblivion Remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</h2></p><div catalogid="e029409f-0020-43ce-95ac-88650ab348d6" id="219126"><div id="219126" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Deluxe Edition also available for $49.79</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is currently the best price for Oblivion on PC bar subscribing to Game Pass. I’ve played the original Oblivion enough times to know exactly where it shows its age, which is why I’m glad this remaster exists. The updated visuals and improved UI give the game a second life without losing what made it great in the first place. You still get the full experience, including expansions like Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine, plus all the classic side content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you missed it the first time around or just want to revisit Cyrodiil without modding your setup into oblivion (pun intended), this is the version to get. I think forty bucks is a fair ask for one of the most influential open-world RPGs of its time, especially with all the extras baked in.</p></div><p id="stray-ost-2-lp-vinyl"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Stray OST 2 LP Vinyl">Stray Soundtrack 2 LP Vinyl</h2></p><div catalogid="e029409f-0020-43ce-95ac-88650ab348d6" id="219127"><div id="219127" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Stray Soundtrack 2 LP Vinyl</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pre-order: Releases Q4 2025</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t usually go for game soundtracks on vinyl unless they feel like something I’d actually sit down and listen to, and this one fits. Stray isn’t just a cat game. It’s a full-on atmosphere piece. The soundtrack blends synths and quiet texture with enough character that you can almost hear the neon signs buzzing. It’s available as a two-disc set on heavyweight black vinyl, and the packaging looks just as moody as the game itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you liked wandering those cyberpunk alleyways with nothing but low music and glowing signage for company, this is an easy recommendation. I think it’s the kind of record that holds up on its own, but also hits differently if you’ve played the game. Pre-orders are open now and ship in Q4 2025.</p></div><p id="cuktech-15-ultra"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="CUKTECH 15 Ultra">CUKTECH 15 Ultra Power Bank</h2></p><div catalogid="e029409f-0020-43ce-95ac-88650ab348d6" id="219124"><div id="219124" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>CUKTECH 15 Ultra Power Bank</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Don't forget the on-site coupon</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve gone through enough power banks to know when one’s actually designed with some thought behind it. This one pushes up to 140W with USB-C PD3.1, which means it can charge a MacBook or gaming handheld fast enough to matter. The smart display is a nice touch too. It shows real-time stats, not just another blinking light.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 20,000mAh capacity is plenty for multiple phone charges or a full laptop cycle, and the recharge time is quick if you’ve got the right charger. I’d say it’s ideal if you travel with more than one device and hate juggling low battery warnings.</p></div><p id="cleer-arc-3"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Cleer ARC 3"> Cleer ARC 3 Open Ear Headphones</h2></p><div catalogid="e029409f-0020-43ce-95ac-88650ab348d6" id="219128"><div id="219128" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Cleer ARC 3 Open Ear Headphones</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Don't forget to use $15 off on-site coupon</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I like the open-ear design because it avoids the usual trade-off between situational awareness and good audio. These stay just outside your ears, but the sound quality still holds up thanks to Dolby Atmos and Snapdragon Sound support. And the fit’s more comfortable than most earbuds I’ve worn, especially for longer sessions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The battery life is solid with up to fifty hours total from the case, and it includes features like auto volume adjustment and UV sterilization. It’s built for someone who actually uses their earbuds all day, not just in short bursts. If that’s you, I think you’ll appreciate the attention to detail here.</p></div><p id="151-booster-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="151 Booster Bundle">Pokémon TCG 151 Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e029409f-0020-43ce-95ac-88650ab348d6" id="219043"><div id="219043" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet - 151 Booster Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Current pricing is over twice the MSRP</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I really want this listing to disappear into the tall grass.

It’s packed with great Kanto art, and yeah there's some killer hits in there. But paying twice retail for the chance at a Charizard? That’s a pass. I think if you’re going to spend over $60, you should at least know what you’re getting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I dug up some single card options that are actually worth the money. You can grab Alakazam ex for around $10, a clean Zapdos holo for under $5, and even that Blastoise art rare for $66 or less if you don’t mind a little light play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Godzilla is one of the biggest names in entertainment, with over 70 years of history since Ishiro Honda's 1954 film.

Destiny 2’s original soundtrack is coming to vinyl, and it looks and sounds awesome. It covers music from The Red War campaign and comes with two LPs, custom art, and even a code for an exclusive in-game emblem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I pre-ordered this the second I saw it. You don’t get a lot of game soundtracks that feel this cinematic, and now you can spin them while pretending Zavala’s giving you a pep talk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played Destiny for any length of time, you know how emotional this music can get. For $44, it’s way cheaper than therapy and a lot cooler than yet another figure collecting dust.</p></div><p id="samsung-odyssey-neo-g9"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Samsung Odyssey Neo G9">57" Odyssey Neo G9 Curved Gaming Monitor</h2></p><div catalogid="e029409f-0020-43ce-95ac-88650ab348d6" id="219046"><div id="219046" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>57" Odyssey Neo G9 Dual 4K UHD Quantum Mini-LED 240Hz 1ms(GtG) HDR 1000 Curved Gaming Monitor</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If the QD-OLED isn’t wild enough for you, this 57-inch Neo G9 is here to take your eyeballs hostage.

Plus, there’s an extra $50 credit applied at checkout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mini-LED tech, 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and enough real estate to run an airport. I want this so badly I’m thinking of measuring my apartment just to see if it’ll fit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The HDR 1000 support and insane brightness make everything pop, and Samsung even threw in CoreSync lighting to make sure your desk feels like a spaceship.</p></div><p id="supreme-unreal-unity-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Supreme Unreal &amp; Unity Bundle">Supreme Unreal &amp; Unity Game Dev Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e029409f-0020-43ce-95ac-88650ab348d6" id="219047"><div id="219047" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Supreme Unreal &amp; Unity Game Dev Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pay less to get fewer items, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity One Tree Planted.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve ever fired up Unity, gotten overwhelmed, and rage-quit to watch a devlog instead, this bundle might be for you. For $30, you get over 50 assets covering everything from Viking villages to stylized VFX.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not saying this will make you the next FromSoftware, but it’ll definitely make prototyping less soul-crushing. The Whispering Grove and Asian Dynasty packs alone are worth more than the bundle price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, it supports charity. So even if you never finish your dream RPG, at least someone benefits from your failed side project.</p></div><p id="samsung-t9-4tb-portable-ssd"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Samsung T9 4TB Portable SSD">Samsung T9 4TB Portable SSD</h2></p><div catalogid="e029409f-0020-43ce-95ac-88650ab348d6" id="219048"><div id="219048" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Portable SSD T9 USB 3.2 Gen2x2 4TB (Black)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this is the drive to get if you’ve got a ton of large files and zero patience. The <strong>T9 4TB</strong> model is down to <strong>$299.99</strong>, and it’s fast. I’m talking <strong>2,000MB/s</strong> fast. You can load, edit, and transfer without watching a loading bar crawl across your screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s built to survive up to a 9.8-foot drop, which, yes, I find oddly specific. But hey, it means it’ll probably survive your daily backpack abuse.

The T5 EVO gives you 4TB of space in a compact shell, and it’s priced the same as the T9. It doesn’t hit the same crazy speeds, but it’s still great for moving big files and not worrying about losing them to the floor gods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I want this for backup storage or even game library overflow. It’s a solid pick if you don’t need bleeding-edge speeds but still want to keep everything in one pocket-sized vault. Buyers can also snag a free Sonic the Hedgehog branded 256GB MicroSD card + adaptor with this deal too.</p></div><p id="journey-together-booster-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Journey Together Booster Bundle">Journey Together Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e029409f-0020-43ce-95ac-88650ab348d6" id="218977"><div id="218977" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet - Journey Together Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon’s been a bit shady with this one. While the overpriced Elite Trainer Box is sitting at a wild $99.49, this six-pack bundle is actually close to MSRP and ships directly from Amazon.
