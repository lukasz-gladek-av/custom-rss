            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Bridging game and reality.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you ever need to make like Sam Porter and hike through tricky terrain while lugging hefty cargo, Kojima Productions literally has your back, or in this case your knees. Hideo Kojima's studio is partnering with exoskeleton maker Dnsys to release an official Death Stranding 2 On The Beach limited edition exoskeleton to provide knee support. The surprise collaboration was revealed on Kojima Productions’ official X accounts in both <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015/status/1987883970403705323?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Japanese</u></a> and <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1987884067178852705?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>English</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back on November 8, Kojima Productions’ <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015/status/1987110126332023186?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Japanese</u></a> and <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1987104080892993781?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>English</u></a> X accounts teased the collaboration under the cryptic tagline: "A new experience that bridges the game and the real world is coming soon." This prompted puzzled users to guess everything from a headset to some kind of gaming chair, with some clocking that the zoomed-in pictures bore some resemblance to Sam’s supportive exoskeleton.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>DNSYS ✖️ DEATH STRANDING 2 co-branded exoskeleton is here 👍</p><p>📦 Dnsys Z1 Exoskeleton Pro – DEATH STRANDING 2 ON THE BEACH Limited Edition<br>It enhances lower-body strength and stability, allowing humans to keep moving through complex terrain and extreme environments. 🦵🦿… <a href="https://t.co/Yi1E6RnKNC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Yi1E6RnKNC</a></p></div>— KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS (Eng) (@KojiPro2015_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1987884067178852705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">As revealed in Kojima Productions’ more recent X post, the mystery product turned out to be an actual exoskeleton, made in collaboration with exoskeleton maker Dnsys, which worked with Kojima Productions' art director Yoji Shinkawa to make it look true to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We designed this exoskeleton with the same passion and precision as if it were built for the world of Death Stranding,” said Shinkawa. “Every detail was refined to bring the game’s futuristic vision into reality, creating something Sam himself might wear." The exoskeleton is battery-powered, and even features lights that show how much juice it has left, just like in Death Stranding. No Bridge Baby included, but that's probably just as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although handy for Sam Porter cosplays, it is also a functional and serious piece of equipment. According to the Dnsys <a href="https://dnsys.ai/pages/z1-exoskeleton-death-stranding2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>website</u></a>, the Death Stranding 2 exoskeleton enhances lower body strength and protects the knee joints by offloading the user's body weight, sort of mimicking the game's load-balancing system in real life. In addition to helping you hike miles further, the product description even boasts that you will “instantly feel up to 44 pounds lighter,” which might be useful when in denial about how much you ate post-Christmas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Death Stranding 2: On The Beach Limited Edition Exoskeleton will be available globally from December 2. No word on the price yet, but Dnsys is giving away three of them through a creative competition, details of which can be found at the <a href="https://dnsys.ai/pages/z1-exoskeleton-death-stranding2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>bottom of the product page</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

The park is split into two areas, a Pokémon Forest and Sedge Town. The Pokémon Forest will be a wooded trail with varied terrains in which visitors can spot different Pokémon statues. Sedge Town will offer rides like the Vee Vee Voyage carousel, a Pokémon Center for merch, a Trainer’s Mart offering park-exclusive refreshments, and the Sedge Gym, where you will be able to watch a stage show (complete with dancing Pikachus). There will also be Pokémon meet and greets, plus a Pokémon parade. Overall, the park promises to feature over 600 Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PokéPark previously existed in Nagoya (Japan) and Taiwan back in 2005 and 2006, respectively.

The Ace Trainer’s Pass lets you freely enter the Pokémon Forest and Sedge Town areas, plus perks like priority lane access for attractions, reserved seats for the Sedge Gym show, meet and greets, and original merch. The Trainer’s Pass gives unlimited access to Sedge Town but gives you a timeslot for the Pokémon Forest. There are also plans to offer a Sedge Town-only pass in the future.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"How do you know what you’re going to get?"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Bungie developer Chris Sides has called out the term "extraction shooter," saying it's a "terrible" genre name because it doesn't tell the player what to expect from the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking on the <a href="https://youtu.be/Xqwje5N5ArA?si=ITRZ6Nsu845IdyhY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Shooter Monthly podcast</u></a>, the former director of product on Bungie's upcoming Marathon didn't hold back, stressing that with so many distinct games potentially falling under the umbrella of "extraction shooter," players will find it hard to know "what you're going to get."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The problem is Helldivers 2 can be called an extraction shooter, but it's not. The genre name is so bad," Sides said (thanks, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/former-bungie-director-different-genre-name-for-marathon-extraction-shooter-dumb/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TheGamePost</u></a>). "I hate the genre name of 'extraction shooter.' When I was working on Marathon, I was working with marketing, dying to be like, 'Can we please create a different genre name, because extraction shooter is so dumb.' It's the only genre where its name is a mechanic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Extraction is the mechanic to get out. Helldivers 2, is that an extraction shooter because you extract? No. It's not like Tarkov at all. So the terminology of the genre is already terrible. It makes it really hard to compare these games. It's why Arena Breakout and Tarkov, you can kind of look at it because they're both extraction shooters and they kind of fit the same mold. Comparing Arc Raiders to Tarkov just doesn't really fit. Comparing Arc Raiders to maybe like a Rust could fit, and then Rust... is that an extraction because it's survivor? It's a problem. I cannot stand the name of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So I think that when you say the extraction genre, it should hit your spot, I think it's really the fact that the genre doesn't even know what it is. So you as a player, how do you know what what you're going to get? And I think that's one of the real issues with the genre itself."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's well worth listening to the podcast, where Sides is joined by other shooter developers in an interesting discussion about the extraction shooter genre generally, as well as the problem with how it's named. They discuss everything from Marathon to Arc Raiders and Helldivers 2 to Escape from Tarkov.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the term 'extraction shooter' may be problematic, according to Sides, it hasn't held back the performance of Arc Raiders, which developer Embark Studios describes as a "multiplayer extraction adventure," as opposed to an extraction shooter. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-officially-a-hit-with-over-4-million-copies-sold-and-a-peak-concurrent-player-count-of-700000-across-all-platforms">It sold 4 million copies in less than two weeks</a>, with a peak concurrent player count of 700,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, it was recently delayed out of 2025 and into 2026 as Bungie works to respond to feedback from playtests. Bungie describes Marathon as a "team-based extraction shooter."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Exclusive news.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> has sold 3.3 million copies in its first month on sale, Sony has confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of its latest financial results, Sony said Sucker Punch’s PlayStation 5-exclusive action adventure sold 3.3 million units in the 32 days since going on sale on October 2 — so sales up to and including November 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony announced the figure without any commentary, so it’s hard to know whether the company is happy with the result. However, there is a great deal of context we can add that helps us paint a picture of Ghost of Yotei’s commercial success.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first comparison we should make is to its predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima. It sold 2.4 million copies in its first three days after going on sale exclusively on PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020, then hit 5 million after 118 days (just shy of four months). It’s now up to 13 million copies sold, including sales of the PC and PS5 Director’s Cut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it’s worth remembering that while we don’t have a figure for a comparable period of sales, it looks like Ghost of Yotei is selling about as well as Ghost of Tsushima before it, a suggestion backed up by sales data <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yoteis-us-launch-was-perfectly-fine-not-amazing-not-bad-says-analyst-but-the-true-test-will-be-in-the-months-ahead">from the U.S.</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sales-of-ps5-exclusive-ghost-of-yotei-in-line-with-ghost-of-tsushima-in-europe-new-data-reveals">across Europe</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But is that good enough? We need to consider that Ghost of Tsushima came out on the PS4, which in the summer of 2020 had a much bigger install base than the PS5 does today, and amid the stay-at-home gaming boom fueled by lockdowns. Ghost of Yotei also sold for $70, which means its dollar sales are greater compared to the cheaper Ghost of Tsushima, whose standard edition launched at $60.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The timing of each release differs also in that Ghost of Tsushima came out in the summer, and Ghost of Yotei came out in the fall. Yotei has the crucial holiday season coming soon, and it will surely be a popular pick for those buying a PS5 for the first time or upgrading to the PS5 Pro.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, multiplayer add-on Ghost of Yotei: Legends comes out at some point in 2026, which will undoubtedly give Ghost of Yotei a shot in the arm next year. And we all know that Ghost of Yotei, like Ghost of Tsushima before it, will eventually launch on PC in Director’s Cut form. Perhaps there will even be a PS6 version, whenever that console rolls around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, Ghost of Yotei has some way to go before it matches the total sales figure of its predecessor, but is has plenty of opportunity to catch up. And, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3wthi4twc2u" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as Circana’s Mat Piscatella said last month</a>, its launch sales were “perfectly fine... Not amazing, not bad.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what’s next from developer Sucker Punch, in an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-will-remain-a-single-project-studio-after-ghost-of-yotei-boss-suggests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>, co-founder and studio head, Brian Fleming, said the studio will decide its next project once Ghost of Yotei: Legends comes out.
