            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Each set comes with a digital code you can use to unlock the vehicles and skins in the game. </h2></p><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, a new take on the classic LEGO game formula, doesn't launch until May 29. Luckily, to hold over all you ravenous Batfans out there, there are a handful of new LEGO sets you can buy that not only look great on your bookshelves lined with your favorite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/absolute-batman-vol-2-is-out-this-week-and-is-already-discounted">Batman comics</a>, but come with some pretty awesome, unique digital download codes you can use in the game. What do you get with the download code after scanning the QR code in the instructions? Well, it wouldn't be a LEGO Batman game without a ton of optional skins, and you'll get some fancy gold minifigure and Batmobile skins for your trouble. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are four of these new sets are available starting on March 1, each of which can be purchased via Amazon or through LEGO directly.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Every LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Set</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out detailed breakdowns of each new set below. The three Batmobile sets each celebrate different eras of iconic Batman films (minus the Christopher Nolan/Christian Bale era, which I am personally bummed about) and will run you $29.99. Each one is a faithful recreation of their onscreen counterparts, complete with a minifigure of that Batmobile's respective Batman.</p><p id="batman-logo"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Batman Logo">LEGO DC Batman: Batman Logo</h3></p><div id="229380"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="229380" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO DC Batman: Batman Logo</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the four available sets with digital bonuses for the game, the Batman Logo is an intricate-looking build made up of 678 pieces that stands fairly tall. It comes with a classic black-suited Batman, as well as a special gold Batman minifigure to help celebrate the 20th anniversary of our favorite Caped Crusader in brick form. The skin you'll get in-game from this set is the gold minifigure. </p></div><p id="batman-v-superman-batmobile"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Batman v Superman Batmobile">LEGO DC Batman: Batman v Superman Batmobile</h3></p><div id="229381"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="229381" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO DC Batman: Batman v Superman Batmobile</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Ben Affleck Batmobile is probably the most different out of any iteration of the car we've seen over the years, but it's still a pretty cool design nonetheless. At 220 pieces, it's the smallest of the bunch, but the plated armor details and Batman v Superman minifigure it comes with make up for it. You'll get a gold version of this Batmobile with the digital download code. </p></div><p id="the-batman-batmobile"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="The Batman Batmobile">LEGO DC Batman: The Batman Batmobile</h3></p><div id="229383"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="229383" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO DC Batman: The Batman Batmobile</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm partial to the Robert Pattinson version from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-batman">The Batman</a> -- this Batmobile is a less exaggerated version of the car we all grew up with, and I love the all-black and off-road-like design. Redeeming the code from this set gets you a gold skin of the Pattinson's Batmobile in the game. This one is 330 pieces, the highest brick count of the three. </p></div><p id="batman-robin-batmobile"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Batman &amp; Robin Batmobile">LEGO DC Batman: Batman &amp; Robin Batmobile</h3></p><div id="229382"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="229382" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO DC Batman: Batman &amp; Robin Batmobile</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For you classic Batman fans, the George Clooney Batmobile from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/batman-robin">Batman &amp; Robin</a> is a 272-piece recreation of that film's vehicle. The red accents on the side are a nice added touch, but sadly the Batman minifigure does not include the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-burton-has-strong-feelings-about-batsuit-nipples">infamous Batnipples</a>. And like the other two sets, the digital download code nets you a gold version of this car. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Is Up For Preorder</h2></div><div id="234234"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234234" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight (PS5)</h3></p></div></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you haven't been following along with IGN Fan Fest, we've had the opportunity to get some exclusive new looks at some more LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight gameplay, where we've learned <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-new-catwoman-gameplay-details-ign-fan-fest-2026">you can play as Catwoman</a>. Both the Standard and Deluxe editions are available to preorder from all major retailers now before it launches May 29, and you can choose to reserve your copy for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with a Nintendo Switch 2 version planned for release later on this year. By preordering any version of the game, you'll receive the Dark Knight Returns Batsuit skin. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.

Pre-orders for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop"><u>Pokémon TCG</u></a>: Mega Evolution - Perfect Order expansion are dropping ahead of its March 27, 2026, release. This gorgeous new set continues the Mega Evolution hype of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a"><u>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</u></a>, bringing Mega Zygarde ex into the spotlight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This guide collects the best deals on the market right now for Pokémon Perfect Order boosters and ETBs, including line-ups, predicted chase cards, and what to expect from this latest collection. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll be regularly updating this page with confirmed deals, so bookmark this page, keep checking back in, and follow <a href="https://x.com/IGNDeals" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>@IGNDeals</u></a> for the latest updates.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>What’s in the Perfect Order Lineup?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As the third main expansion of cards from the Mega Evolution Series of the Pokémon Trading Card Game, this set has over 120 cards. There’s plenty to get your hands on, because let’s be real, we’re not just buying one. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Booster Packs</li><li>Booster Boxes (36 packs)</li><li>Elite Trainer Box</li><li>Pokémon Center Exclusive Elite Trainer Box</li><li>Booster Bundle (6 packs)</li><li>Triple-Pack Blisters (Meganium, Cinderace, Steelix, Clawitzer, Makuhita)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Perfect Order will introduce new mechanics, four Mega Evolution Pokémon ex; nine Pokémon ex; 11 illustration rare Pokémon; 18 ultra rare Pokémon and Trainer cards; and six special illustration rare Pokémon and Supporter cards.Look out for Mega Zygarde ex, Mega Clefable ex, Mega Starmie ex, and the newly revealed Mega Skarmory ex!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seemingly confirmed via Japanese set lists (M3), which historically dictate about 90% of what we see in our English releases, it will also introduce <a href="https://limitlesstcg.com/cards/jp/M3/79?translate=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Telepath Psychic Energy</u></a>, which provides psychic energy as long as this card is attached to a Pokémon. Neat! </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Where to Preorder Pokémon TCG Perfect Order</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While preordering ensures you get what you want, there’s no saying what the market will do in the weeks following release. Here are the most reliable sources right now, but we’re still waiting for a few preorders to drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>TCGplayer </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPlayer is a reliable third-party retailer that has <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ8gJq?object_uuid=a03d3eb2-539e-401a-b70f-14e1aa04e142&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>all Perfect Order options</u></a> available for preorder. This is your best option for securing everything at the moment, but only if you're ultimately comfortable with paying over MSRP. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Albeit, compared to previous expansions, Perfect Order's market price isn't <em>that </em>far over standard pricing. For example, a <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ83Wp?object_uuid=a03d3eb2-539e-401a-b70f-14e1aa04e142&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">booster box set is running for around $200 right now</a>, about $40 more than Best Buy is selling it for at MSRP. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a similar story for the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqJVo3?object_uuid=a03d3eb2-539e-401a-b70f-14e1aa04e142&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Elite Trainer Boxes, listed at around $100 market price</a>, which is $50 more than MSRP. But, that's already $20 less than the recently released Ascended Heroes, and far better than the average $150-$200 we see more regularly. Hopefully Perfect Order follows the same trend as Phantasmal Flames and drops below $100 soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Walmart</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walmart will likely have Perfect Order preorders between now and release day on March 27. To be in the best chance to securing anything at MSRP, you'll need to be a paid Walmart+ member to early access to the drops. No free trial option here, you'll need to be paying for your membership to be in the race.</p><div id="192311"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="192311" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Walmart+ Membership</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pokémon Center US</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The classic, and always the first to sell out. You’ll get the absolute best price (MSRP) and the exclusive Pokémon Center ETB, which has two copies of a full-art foil promo card featuring Tyrunt (one with a Pokémon Center logo).</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Perfect Order Pokémon Center <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/10-10372-109/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-perfect-order-pokemon-center-elite-trainer-box" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Elite Trainer Box</u></a> - $59.99</li><li>Perfect Order <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/10-10380-119/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-perfect-order-booster-display-box-36-packs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Booster Display Box</u></a> (36 Packs) - $161.64</li><li>Perfect Order <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/10-10377-109/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-perfect-order-booster-bundle-6-packs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Booster Bundle</u></a> (6 Packs) - $26.94</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Keep an eye out for restocks as March approaches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best Buy</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Best Buy often has "Coming Soon" listings, and launches pre-orders closer to release than other retailers. Pre-orders haven’t gone live here yet, so keep checking back. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Perfect Order <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrJ2eE?object_uuid=a03d3eb2-539e-401a-b70f-14e1aa04e142&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Elite Trainer Box</u></a> - $49.99</li><li>Perfect Order <a href="https://zdcs.link/9ZA1lP?object_uuid=a03d3eb2-539e-401a-b70f-14e1aa04e142&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Booster Box</u></a> (36 Packs) - $160.99</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember - it also offers "Pick up in-store" options, which are always popular. If you want to risk it, keep your local Best Buy in mind for release day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Amazon</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perfect Order is an English curated localization of the Japanese Nihil Zero expansion. Amazon US currently has no listing for Perfect Order. But, we usually see the online retailer begin to stock new sets after release, so keep an eye out through to March 27.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Predicted Chase Cards</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We can look at the SAR pull rates from the Japanese Nihil Zero expansion and secondary market prices in Japan to predict chase cards for the US market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unsurprisingly, the new Mega Ultra Rare <a href="https://pokeninjapan.store/products/117-080-mega-zygarde-ex-japanese-pokemon-single-card?" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mega Zygarde ex</u></a> (card #117/080 in the Japanese set) fetches a pretty penny on Japanese marketplace PokeninJapan thanks to its "Nullifying Zero" attack mechanic. <a href="https://pokeninjapan.store/products/115-080-rosas-encouragement-japanese-pokemon-single-card" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>{115/080} Rosa's Encouragement</u></a> is also trending high.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the March 27 2026 release draws ever-closer, we’re sure to see more pre-orders dropping. Keep checking back for more information! </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Sara Heritage is a freelance contributor for IGN.</em></p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-where-to-buy-perfect-order]]></content:encoded>
