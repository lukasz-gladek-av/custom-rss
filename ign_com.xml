            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The latest trailer shows more combat and open-world exploration.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Open-world action RPG The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin released a new trailer as part of gamescom’s Opening Night Live on Tuesday and also announced that sign-ups are open now for an upcoming <a href="https://ntiny.link/7DSO_IGN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">closed beta test</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Presented by Netmarble, The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin tells an original story set in Britannia, the same world as the globally popular The Seven Deadly Sins anime and manga series. The art style is also inspired by those series, and the game’s multiverse narrative will transcend timelines and dimensions to combine brand-new characters with established heroes from throughout the series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest trailer continues a trend of releasing new footage at major game shows this year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/open-world-action-rpg-the-seven-deadly-sins-origin-unveils-two-new-trailers?_gl=1*1i895aq*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTY3MDY1MTM0MC4xNzU0MDc1NTYw*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NTQwNzU1NTkkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTQwNzU1NTkkajYwJGwwJGgw"><u>Two new trailers</u></a> released back-to-back at Summer Game Fest and the Future Games Show in June, and now the gamescom trailer (which you can watch above) shows some brand-new footage and gives us a look at combat and exploration. The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin is also scheduled to be showcased at Tokyo Game Show in September, and its presence at all these major game shows is steadily building momentum and anticipation of a release later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Narrated by the Japanese voice actor of Meliodas, one of the series’ lead characters, the new trailer begins by giving us a glimpse of its vast open world from atop a cliff. We then see a series of short clips of characters that fans of the series will recognize before transitioning to exploration of the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s fishing and then the main character Tristan inserts blocks into a small monument and is rewarded with the appearance of a treasure chest. So it seems like the open world will have scattered environmental puzzles to solve and earn rewards.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/environmental-puzzle-1754502772701.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After that, there’s a look at traversal methods. A character jumps onto a spinning flower and rides its updraft of wind into the air before summoning a flying mount, and then we see the full party exploring a desert region on the backs of other flying mounts. So you won’t have to hoof it across Britannia all the time; that’s a relief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the trailer is essentially a supercut of several different characters in flashy, fast-paced combat against some wild-looking enemies. The combat showcase includes switching between characters to combo their attacks together, along with multiple different elements being used — lightning, fire, and ice all make an appearance. The trailer ends with 10 characters running toward the horizon together, giving us a taste of the large cast that will be available.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/huge-monster-1754502995894.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the trailer, Netmarble announced that they’re now accepting sign-ups for an upcoming closed beta test that will give fans a preview of gameplay mechanics, character interactions, and environments. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can sign up on the game’s <a href="https://ntiny.link/7DSO_IGN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">official website</a>, and everyone is eligible.
