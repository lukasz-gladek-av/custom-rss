            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is shuttering Firewalk Studios in the wake of its disastrous release of Concord, the PS5 shooter that lasted less than two weeks before being shuttered. The news was first reported by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-acquires-aaa-multiplayer-developer-firewalk-studios">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Firewalk Studios' closure follows the reported departure of director Ryan Ellis, who stepped down after Concord was taken offline. Sony Interactive Entertainment publicly posted the internal email from Studio Business Group CEO Hermen Hulst with a <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement on the closure</a>, which you can read below. Hulst wrote that SIE had "spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options," but ultimately decided to sunset the studio, which it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-acquires-aaa-multiplayer-developer-firewalk-studios">had acquired in April 2023</a>. The email also announces SIE's decision to close Neon Koi, a German studio working on a mobile action game.</p><blockquote>Dear Team, </blockquote><blockquote>Today, I want to share some important updates from Sony Interactive Entertainment’s Studio Business Group.   </blockquote><blockquote>We consistently evaluate our games portfolio and status of our projects to ensure we are meeting near and long-term business priorities. As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen SIE’s Studio Business, we have had to make a difficult decision relating to two of our studios – Neon Koi and Firewalk Studios.  </blockquote><blockquote>Expanding beyond PlayStation devices and crafting engaging online experiences alongside our single-player games are key focal areas for us as we evolve our revenue streams.  We need to be strategic, though, in bringing our games to new platforms and recognize when our games fall short of meeting player expectations.   </blockquote><blockquote>While mobile remains a priority growth area for the Studio Business, we are in the very early stage of our mobile efforts.  To achieve success in this area we need to concentrate on titles that are in-line with PlayStation Studios’ pedigree and have the potential to reach more players globally.  </blockquote><blockquote>With this re-focused approach, Neon Koi will close, and its mobile action game will not be moving forward. I want to express my gratitude to everyone at Neon Koi for their hard work and endless passion to innovate.   </blockquote><blockquote>Regarding Firewalk, as announced in early September  (<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Important Update on Concord</a>), certain aspects of Concord were exceptional, but others did not land with enough players, and as a result we took the game offline.  We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options.   </blockquote><blockquote>After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio.  I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication.  </blockquote><blockquote>The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title. We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area.   </blockquote><blockquote>I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing SIE.  Both decisions were given serious thought, and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organization. Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible. </blockquote><blockquote>I am a big believer in the benefits of embracing creative experimentation and developing new IP. However, growing through sustainable financials, especially in a challenged economic environment is critical.   </blockquote><blockquote>While today is a difficult day, there is much to look forward to in the months ahead from the Studio Business Group and our teams.  I remain confident that we are building a resilient and capable organization driven by creating unforgettable entertainment experiences for our players.   </blockquote><blockquote>Thank you for your continued support.  </blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/firewalkstudios_firewalk-is-signing-off-one-last-time-firewalk-activity-7257092832086089729-20Uf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A post on LinkedIn </a>from Firewalk Studios said that the studio "began with the idea of bringing the joy of multiplayer to a larger audience." It notes that it began as a new startup in 2018, built a customized FPS engine, and more. The post goes on, "We took some risks along the way – marrying aspects of card battlers and fighting games with first-person-shooters – and although some of these and other aspects of the IP didn’t land as we hoped, the idea of putting new things into the world is critical to pushing the medium forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The talent at Firewalk and the level of individual craft is truly world-class, and teams within Sony Interactive Entertainment and across the industry will be fortunate to work with them. Please reach out to Recruiting at PlayStation for inquiries, and thank you to all the very many teams, partners and fans who supported us along the way."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">First released on August 23 for PS5 and PC, Concord struggled at the outset with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-victim-long-development-time-playstation">low concurrents</a> before Sony suddenly announced it was pulling the plug on September 3. We wrote in our postmortem of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-victim-long-development-time-playstation">why Sony's hero shooter failed</a>, "The cost of coming late to the party means you must bring something new to the table. Unfortunately, Concord is neither particularly innovative nor content-heavy." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Analysts, meanwhile, pointed to its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">weak marketing, high price point, and lack of distinguishing characteristics</a> in the midst of moving an estimated 25,000 units.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title," Hulst wrote in his email announcing the closure.

Xbox, EA, Riot, and other publishers have all experienced layoffs in the past year, and Playstation-owned Bungie announced cuts in August <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-says-it-remains-committed-to-destiny-after-layoffs-will-reveal-plans-for-multi-year-journey-soon">impacting around 17 percent of the studio</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, there are signs of trouble for PlayStation's other live service games. Bungie recently posted a lengthy development update video for Marathon that nevertheless noted that it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-shooter-marathon-is-on-track-but-too-early-in-development-to-show">still too early to show</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fairgame-is-the-first-game-from-jade-raymonds-haven-studios">Fairgame$ has been mostly MIA since first being revealed in 2023</a>.

As for Concord, there was speculation that it might go free-to-play at some point, but with Firewalk's shutdown it appears to be finished for good. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"See you in the Tempest," Firewalk's goodbye post reads before signing off one last time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-just-quietly-launched-a-full-blown-nft-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It's called Champions Tactics and it sure looks like...something.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Three years ago, Ubisoft <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-plans-create-blockchain-games-enable-pay-to-earn">promised it would start making its own blockchain games</a>. Now it appears to have done it, having stealth-launched a full-blown web3 game last week called Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Champions Tactics is billed as a "PVP tactical RPG game on PC", and is both developed and published by Ubisoft. It involves collectible figurines of various warriors from the in-game fantasy world of Grimoria, which players assemble into squads of three and then battle in turn-based combat that looks oddly reminscent of Darkest Dungeon, of all things. It's not evident from the trailer that this is a web3 game at all, but a quick glance at the game's website or even its official <a href="https://twitter.com/ChampionsVerse" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter page</a> reveals this immediately.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The web3 comes into play as a method of collecting figurines to battle with. When you first start the game, you're given some temporary figurines to play with, but you'll eventually need to either purchase actual figurines, aka NFTs, from other players using either in-game gold or cryptocurrency, or craft your own using the "Forge" system which also requires either in-game currency or crypto. At the time of this piece, five days after launch, the in-game marketplace has figurines for sale ranging from around $7 to a whopping $63k for something called a "Swift Zealot". That said, just because a figurine is listed for that much doesn't mean people are paying that much. The next-highest listed champion currently runs around $25k, and while a handful more cost thousands the high-end stuff mostly appears to be capping around $335.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Champions Tactics is free to download, though you have to have a Ubisoft account and a supported blockchain wallet to actually play it. While it appears you can technically play the game entirely for free without ever engaging with NFTs using in-game currency, the viability of this strategy is likely going to be dependent on how the prices for actually powerful characters fluctuates over the game's lifespan. It's a PvP game, with no campaign and no PvE beyond a "Training" mode, so free-to-play players will inevitably be at the mercy of people willing to engage with the NFT marketplace and spend real money to buy or forge the absolute best champions — a real pay-to-win dilemma. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One other limiting factor in playing Champions Tactics is its age rating. Ubisoft lists the game as Adults Only, and restricts players who have not confirmed they are 18 or older from playing. Oddly, while Ubisoft is using the ESRB's rating category, Champions Tactics doesn't appear in the ESRB's online database listing all games with ratings and why those ratings were issued. IGN has reached out to the ESRB for comment and clarity on what's happening here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the fact that Ubisoft is doing basically exactly what it said it was going to do, it seems odd that the company is going all-in on web3 like this now. Whatever gamer enthusiasm for NFTs and blockchain there was in 2021 has died down significantly, with companies like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-will-not-allow-nfts-or-blockchain-technologies">Mojang</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gabe-newell-nft-steam">Valve</a> outright rejecting them, EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-not-driving-hard-direction-nfts">backpedaling on an initial enthusiasm</a>, Sega <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sega-scales-back-blockchain-plans" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">determining it's boring</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamestops-nft-marketplace-closes-next-month">GameStop's own efforts outright failing</a>. Even <a href="https://quartz.ubisoft.com/Game:7c788439-f696-4362-8848-d719eeb3e9d2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft's own past efforts with NFTs</a> have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/04/ubisofts-first-nft-experiment-was-a-dumpster-fire/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largely failed to resonate</a> and subsequently gone quiet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of which maybe explains why Ubisoft has been, not necessarily secretive, but not exactly loud about this game in front of what most would consider mainstream gaming audiences. Champions Tactics was announced back in June of 2023 and various news items have floated out over the last year about its progress, largely reported at outlets focused on web3 and NFT news. But it wasn't exactly headlining with this game at Ubisoft Forward or anything.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Our shared goal is to explore new ways to play alongside bringing more value to players based on empowerment and ownership</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-nft-blockchain-web3-elixir">companies who are still pushing the technology</a> have yet to answer <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-were-passing-on-blockchain-pitches" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ongoing concerns</a> about its frequent use in and as scams, its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/01/13/why-blockchain-nfts-and-web3-have-a-sustainability-problem/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potentially massive environmental impact</a>, and perhaps most critically for gaming, how blockchain technology is good or useful for video games in the first place. Ubisoft, to its credit, has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-quartz-nfts-reconsider-environmental-impact">expressed concerns before</a> about the environmental impact of NFTs, and the blockchain that Champions Tactics uses (Oasys) claims to be "<a href="https://docs.oasys.games/docs/whitepaper/solution/ecosystem-design%20copy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">environmentally friendly</a>". But fundamentally, Ubisoft's perspective on the tech seems surprisingly bullish; the vice president of its Strategic Innovation Lab  <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-exec-says-gamers-dont-get-it-when-it-comes-to-nfts">seems to think gamers just "don't get it." </a>Whether or not they can be made to "get it" via games like Champions Tactics remains to be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We reached out to Ubisoft for comment on the game ahead of this piece's publication. We asked them for any information on the Adults Only rating and its absence from the ESRB website, as well as for general comment on why Ubisoft is continuing to pursue a web3 strategy and if it intends to continue to do so in the future. Francois Bodson, studio director at Ubisoft Paris, responded as follows:</p><blockquote>The team inside the Ubisoft Paris studio developing Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles partnered with Ubisoft’s Strategic Innovation Lab and Oasys to ensure that our use of blockchain was done in service of delivering new and innovative gaming experiences for our players. Our shared goal is to explore new ways to play alongside bringing more value to players based on empowerment and ownership. Champions Tactics offers deep strategic gameplay featuring unique in-game assets and several exciting innovations. These include millions of procedurally generated figurines, each with distinct stats, assets shaped directly by players' choices, and an open marketplace letting players compose their teams on a peer-to-peer basis —much like a physical trading card game. For months, we have collaborated closely with our community through events and beta phases to build and refine Champions Tactics. We’re excited to keep expanding and enhancing the experience together.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft as a whole has been having a rough several years, weathering a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-has-officially-stopped-development-on-ghost-recon-frontline">steady</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-for-the-sixth-time">cadence</a> of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-for-the-sixth-time">game</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025">delays</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cuts-45-jobs-in-its-us-offices">three</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-hit-by-more-layoffs-in-customer-service-and-elsewhere">rounds</a> of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-lays-off-124-employees-to-enhance-collective-efficiency">layoffs</a> in the last year, a series of AAA releases <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales">failing to meet expectations</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disgruntled-ubisoft-investor-calls-on-assassins-creed-maker-to-go-private-as-shares-slump">general investor frustration</a>.
