As a make-good, it’s giving all PlayStation Plus members an additional five days of service.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, some PlayStation customers are demanding more information on the cause of the downtime beyond the vague “operational issue,” and have pointed to the high-profile PSN data breach of 2011 that saw personal details from approximately 77 million accounts compromised.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/10/gettyimages-2197511020-1739195956853.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The PSN hack of 2011 is still fresh in the memory of some gamers.

Embattled U.S. retailer GameStop tweeted a joke at Sony’s expense while PSN was offline, saying “bet y’all want physical copies now.” But this joke was met with ridicule across social media, as users pointed out the declining shop chain’s penchant for selling products other than video games these days.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah let me go to my local GameStop and grab some physical ga- <a href="https://t.co/zpCn71rF5t" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/zpCn71rF5t</a> <a href="https://t.co/W1J9ECChUE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/W1J9ECChUE</a></p>— 「WOKEN ELMA SIMP」 (@WOKENJJT) <a href="https://twitter.com/WOKENJJT/status/1888309913514123362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Some third-party publishers whose games were affected have announced extensions to in-game events or limited-time modes. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-gets-extra-24-hours-after-psn-outage">Capcom just announced an extension to the next Monster Hunter Wilds beta test</a> after last weekend’s was cut short by the PSN issue. EA was forced to extend FC 25's most hardcore multiplayer event, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is yet to expand on the PSN downtime beyond two single tweets: one to acknoledge PSN was offline, another to say it was back up with the vague explanation and compensation. Clearly, some customers want further communication from the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/as-civilization-7-dataminers-discover-reference-to-the-atomic-age-firaxis-says-were-excited-for-where-this-is-going<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> dataminers have unearthed evidence to suggest the game is set to receive a fourth, unannounced Age — and developer Firaxis has teased its plans in an interview with IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A full campaign in Civilization 7 is one that goes through all three Ages: Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern. Once the Age is completed, all players (and any AI opponents) experience an Age Transition simultaneously. During an Age Transition, three things happen: you select a new civilization from the new Age to represent your empire, you choose which Legacies you want to retain in the new Age, and the game world evolves. The Civilization games have never had such a system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on the unit types and victory conditions currently in-game, the Modern Age ends before the Cold War. In an interview with IGN, Civilization 7 lead designer Ed Beach confirmed this timeline, explaining how Firaxis settled on ending the current version of the game at the conclusion of World War 2.</p><div id="best-civ-7-leaders" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Civ 7 Leaders</h3><h3>Best Civ 7 Leaders</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“We spent a lot of time looking at the ebbs and flows of history,” Beach said. “Once we knew that our game would benefit by breaking it up into chapters, obviously the first thing we ask ourselves is, ‘well, when does a chapter start and when does a chapter end?’ And our senior historian on the project, Andrew Johnson, was working very closely with me, comes from a study of Southeast Asian history. My tendencies are way too focused on Western history, but he's very good at making sure that we're looking at the whole picture worldwide. But we did notice that all the big empires of antiquity, it wasn't just the Roman Empire, but even the big empires over in China and India crumbled under outside pressure in the rough same time period, the 300 to 500 common era time period that Rome was being challenged. Those big empires face challenges across the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So we're like, okay, that's a great ending chapter for the first block of our game or what we're going to call the Age. So that's where Antiquity ends. And so we started looking for other places where the other chapters should end. The transition from Exploration to Modern is all about those big monarchies that were established, especially in places like Europe being challenged by people's revolutions, like the French Revolution or the American Revolution. There were a lot of revolutions in Europe in the 1840s as well. So that felt like a good grounding point. And then the nations emerging from it, the Americas and the French and so forth, could be in the Modern Age that follows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Then we looked for where's the next big shakeup worldwide in history, and it was the World Wars. We had to feel like there was a big pivot in history in 1945 essentially after the World Wars. Especially because we have new gameplay systems that can be unique for each Age, so we can change the rules of diplomacy or the rules of warfare, which commanders you have access to, whenever we change Ages, we need to make sure that those breaks have enough conformity to what happened in real life that they make sense to us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So yeah, we very deliberately did not push into the Cold War time period because that is one that just felt very different than the rest of the Modern Age. It just sort of dips its toes in the Cold War, like you've identified with the thermonuclear device being the one that ends the military victory path there.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The inevitable follow-up question is, of course, whether Firaxis plans to expand Civilization 7 down the line with the addition of a fourth Age where players may, perhaps, go to space, land on the moon, and get to play with up to day units.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Executive producer Dennis Shirk wouldn’t confirm this outright, but did tease the developer’s future plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You can imagine the possibilities with this, honestly,” Shirk said. “The way that the design team set it up so that each age is chockfull of systems, visuals, units, Civs, all specific to that age, and what you could do with that and where you could take it… we can't talk about the specifics. We can just talk about it in generalities. We're excited for where this is going to go.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot on the heels of this tease, Civilization 7 players have already datamined the game, which is available in advanced access to those who paid more, and found reference to the Atomic Age.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1ikk193/so_according_to_the_asset_cloudenv_in_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor ManByTheRiver11</a> revealed mention of unannounced leaders, civilizations, and word of the Atomic Age. New leaders and civs are of course expected, given Firaxis’ DLC strategy for previous games in the series. And this Atomic Age would certainly fit the bill with where Civ 7 currently ends and Shirk’s tease in our interview.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Firaxis is working on addressing various community complaints that have led to a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam. In an interview with IGN ahead of the release of its third quarter financial results, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-legacy-civilization-audience-will-eventually-come-around-on-civilization-7-amid-mixed-steam-user-reviews">Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick acknowledged that Civilization 7 had received some negative reviews from press and players</a>, but insisted that the “legacy Civ audience” will come around the more they play, and called Civilization 7’s early performance “very encouraging.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for tips to help you take over the world?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is set to launch fall 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S only, leaving one platform in particular out in the cold: PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an omission in keeping with developer Rockstar’s playbook for its previous games, but in 2025 feels outdated. And, given the increasing importance of the PC for a multiplatform game’s success, is GTA 6’s no-show on PC a missed opportunity or even a mistake?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN put that question to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick ahead of the company’s recent financial results, and in his response he teased GTA 6’s <em>eventual</em> release on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So with Civ 7 it's available on console and PC and Switch right away,” Zelnick said of Firaxis' recently launched Civilization 7. “With regard to others in our lineup, we don't always go across all platforms simultaneously. Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar fans have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years. Still, some had hoped that a game as big as GTA 6 could be a turning point for the studio's PC gaming attitude.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Rockstar titles tend to get to PC eventually, but the question of how long PC gamers will have to wait for what could end up being one of the biggest games ever remains. Given GTA 6’s fall 2025 release window, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">which Take-Two is still confident in</a>, it seems likely PC players won’t get to play the game until 2026 at the earliest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstar <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-rockstar-dev-tries-to-explain-why-gta-6-is-coming-to-pc-after-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s"><u>attempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hits PS5 and Xbox Series X and S</u></a>, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how big of a missed opportunity could skipping PC for GTA 6’s launch be? Zelnick told IGN that the PC version of a multiplatform game can generate 40% of overall sales, or even more with certain games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That stat came as part of a discussion about the current console generation, which has seen sales of the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S — the two consoles GTA 6 launches on later this year — plummet. While Nintendo has the Switch 2 waiting in the wings, neither Sony nor Microsoft have announced their next-gen consoles. How long before the industry needs the PlayStation 6 and whatever Xbox is next?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelnick pointed to the PC platform as growing in importance, even as console sales fall, while publishers wait for Sony and Microsoft’s next moves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue,” he said. “Of course, there will be a new console generation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In any case, according to Zelnick, the release of GTA 6, which is expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time, will drive console sales as fans jump into the current generation for the first time in order to play the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you have a big title in the market and we have many of them coming, historically that has sold consoles,” Zelnick said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I think that will happen this year. I don't think tariffs are going to be our friend, but I think there will be a meaningful uptick in console sales in calendar 25 because of the release schedule, not just coming from us, but coming from others. So I'm not concerned about that [console sales falling]. I think the trend that you'd want to focus on is this increasing share of the market that is reflected in PC.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, many see the PlayStation 5 Pro as a future 'GTA 6 machine,' in the hopes it will be the best platform to play the game when it comes out. However, tech experts believe <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts">the PS5 Pro probably won't run GTA 6 at 4K60</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
