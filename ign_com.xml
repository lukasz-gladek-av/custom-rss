            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last night's Sony State of Play broadcast ended with an announcement and shadow drop for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta">God of War Sons of Sparta</a>, a side-scrolling spin-off listed as having 1-2 player support via the PlayStation Store. The only problem? Fans can't find its two-player option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early reports from those who've paid the game's $29.99 asking price and revisited Kratos' origins say that his sibling Deimos only appears at certain points, there's no two-player option in the game's menus, and plugging in a second PS5 controller doesn't provide extra options. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an odd situation that's led some to suspect the PlayStation Store <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012744" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">listing</a> is simply incorrect — as it appears to be the only firm evidence a two-player mode exists — and seek help from others online also searching for its multiplayer.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/screenshot-2026-02-13-130432-1770993202798.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">God of War Sons of Sparta, listed for 1-2 players. Image credit: PlayStation/IGN</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Writing on reddit and social media, fans say the store's listing didn't initially seem odd — since the game's title is "Sons of Sparta" plural, in-game footage shows the two brothers killing bosses together, and its cover artwork focuses on them fighting side-by-side. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's store description could also be ready ambiguously, referencing the exploits of both brothers: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Experience an untold chapter in Kratos' journey set during the harsh years of Spartan training alongside his brother Deimos," Sons of Sparta's official blurb reads. "Through endless trials, their minds, bodies, and hearts have been molded to become Spartan soldiers for whom duty and honor mean everything. After a fellow cadet goes missing, Kratos and Deimos vow to find him and embark on an adventure that will put their training and Spartan spirit to the test."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Just got it installed and running," wrote God of War fan Mephistocheles on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r38od8/god_of_war_sons_of_sparta_metroidvania_announced/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, in a lengthy thread with much discussion on the game's lack of co-op play. "So far it's not allowing drop in play on 2nd controller and there were no two-player options on start menu. Will update if I find it does allow co-op, but it doesn't look like it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I’m so sad," wrote bob_th4_build3r. "I bought it instantly because i thought it would be co-op… maybe they will add it in the future?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other comments say they are now escalating the matter to PlayStation's customer support, while several fans say they have tried to request refunds. IGN has contacted PlayStation and Sons of Sparta developer Mega Cat Studios for clarification on the game's two-player capabilities, or lack thereof.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony's State of Play show also included the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-side-scrolling-spin-off-out-today-and-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-announced-sony-state-of-play">surprise announcement of a God of War Trilogy Remake</a>, though work on the project at Sony Santa Monica is still in its early stages.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/zero-parades-writer-hopes-zaum-never-becomes-a-aaa-studio</link>
            <guid>1435393</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“Even if Zero Parades sells four billion copies, I hope we are wise enough to stay true to our core sensibilities.”</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer ZA/UM may have had a significant hit with 2019’s Disco Elysium, but it remains a reasonably small studio. And, at least as far as writer and VO director Jim Ashilevi is concerned, that’s how things should remain. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I hope we'll never become a triple-A studio,” he said during a recent interview with IGN. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">ZA/UM currently employs just under 100 members of staff, many of whom work remotely from different places across the world. Its has offices in Tallinn, Estonia; London, UK; and Porto, Portugal, and the company remains independently owned. While this is admittedly a bigger outfit than many indie developers enjoy, it’s still small-scale. And that’s how Ashilevi likes it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think we're always deeply encouraged and inspired by the indie scene because that's where the fresh ideas come from,” he said. “The avant-garde stuff always happens on the fringes, and I hope we'll never become a triple-A studio. Honestly, even if Zero Parades sells four billion copies, I hope we are wise enough to stay true to our core sensibilities and values as artists and storytellers.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of that conversation, Ashilevi offered his assessment of the gaming landscape. “I think it's grim out there,” he said. “I think the industry is in a really rough place. We all know that. But I don't think the industry is in a rough place creatively. I think, in a way, it's better than ever. It's better than ever before because anyone can make a game that touches the hearts of hundreds of millions of people.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The comment came in reference to the success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which, while developed on a much higher budget than any of ZA/UM’s projects, was 2025’s demonstration that there’s an enormous appetite for single-player, story-led games produced outside of the mega-publishers’ circles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the industry has become less gatekeep-y in a way,” he said. “But that also presents another problem, which is how do you even begin to promote your game, or make sure that it actually finds its audience? I think really the only thing you can control is whether you're staying true to your own vision and your own voice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we explored earlier this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/power-comic-books-and-zero-parades-for-dead-spies-how-zaum-found-its-disco-elysium-successor"><u>that vision has been ZA/UM’s “North Star” when it comes to Zero Parades</u></a>. “For that reason, I'm already really proud and happy with what we've done,” says Ashilevi. “It's like the response coming from the players – which will hopefully be positive, mostly positive – is almost just a bonus at this point. The real value I got out of it as a storyteller was just getting to know my friends and colleagues a little better and getting to know more about what goes on in their hearts and minds and souls.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from ZA/UM, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zero-parades-and-disco-elysium-developer-zaum-on-ai-we-dont-use-it">the studio’s stance on using AI</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zaums-new-rpg-is-similar-to-disco-elysium-because-were-still-the-same-people">why its new RPG resembles Disco Elysium so closely</a>.

Known to fans around the world as ‘Pokémon Day’, 2026 will be a special 30th anniversary celebration! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To celebrate, The Pokémon Company has recently dropped a 30th Anniversary Pokémon Day TCG Collection, featuring a specially stamped foil Pikachu promo card, a metallic coin featuring the 30th anniversary logo, and three booster packs from Phantasmal Flames and Mega Evolution.</p><div id="234519"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234519" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Pokémon Day 2026 Collection</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Proving a popular set, Pokémon TCG's 30th Anniversary TCG Collection is stocked at all major retailers. However, navigating the market requires a bit of strategy; prices are fluctuating from its original $49.99 launch price. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the week following its release, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a07ekA?object_uuid=a60c8e55-21b1-4f63-af47-e53122b1cea8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGplayer</u></a> reported a low sale price of $18.79. That’s a decent drop from the launch price, though it’s back up to around $26.98 market price at the time of writing. Still, that's a significant 58.87% drop in resale value in just a month, making this all the more affordable for fans to pick up right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking for the lowest "in-stock" price right now, direct from a major retailer, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pok%C3%A9mon-TCG-Day-2026-Collection/dp/B0G2FVLXVL/ref=sr_1_1?crid=36VQRZIV3UEAJ&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fpJDom5qEWmKC0FcSlN6VIskxWDbsXrw_vz63nbDXOnPWWrJIH7xP97VRCaDCHQoaTT0Ax7GTdN5nAlTKd8v0h9qirbSbiiEWD7eKZwOhLB-lNHalc47TcMFdCpXSBpPCg-DQ0-aLHK6CIw_iviZoheXuUpnyGVWClbf0bjytHgyS6KktRc0tr9vVcWTSni_lAL_vwiFH5wcas89RIfpjBp9RReM80I2BPu6NENeqB5DzDIyrVlAZKqGB5VFaoUy2icu9opjnW-xVdPVcgpB8oJ8vCyIA96S2gcHIWaaKbg.dCTp1x9Nb8Laf8Ks31TMSiKjSHnlOi-hH0k2yZJu17s&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=pokemon+pokemon+day+collection&amp;qid=1768584789&amp;sprefix=pokemon+pokemon+day+collection%2Caps%2C210&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=tcg-ign-20&amp;ascsubtag=06U9e7yJctIoHdAg4l1vnCG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Amazon</u></a> leads the pack at $34.45 (a 31% discount from MSRP). That being said, we’ve seen them dip <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-day-2026-tcg-collection-is-back-in-stock-with-a-major-new-discount-at-amazon"><u>as low as $26.99</u></a> here before, so it’s up to you if you want to hold for that or opt for TCGplayer instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Q45Eq4?object_uuid=a60c8e55-21b1-4f63-af47-e53122b1cea8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Best Buy</u></a> is holding firm at $49.99, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/aR72pE?object_uuid=a60c8e55-21b1-4f63-af47-e53122b1cea8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Target</u></a> has already been cleaned out of their $17.99 stock - a price so low you can’t be surprised!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re hunting for a sub-$20 pull, it’s best to keep an eye on local inventory or set up an alert for online restocks from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg"><u>reputable resellers</u></a>. Just remember - these figures are based on US retailers, so international collectors should factor in global shipping costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking to resell yourself, I’d recommend you keep looking. Given the lack of exclusive anniversary packs inside, it’s not likely the Pokémon TCG's 30th Anniversary TCG Collection will turn over a huge profit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, while the stamped foil promo card of Pikachu isn’t a unique illustration, its status as the first official 30th-anniversary product might be worth something to completionists in a few years. I’d recommend picking up two at or near MSRP if you’ve got the space - one to hold onto as an investment, one to rip.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-full-release-schedule-2026"><u>one more Pokémon TCG set</u></a> to be released in the first quarter of the year - Perfect Order.

"When we added most of the people on the list it was ages ago, like, Ethan was included a good four years back," McMillen explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I wanted the game to feature a huge array of iconic voices I’ve been hearing echoing across the internet for most of my time making games. As some probably noticed, I was all over the place when it came to cameos and did my best to include and keep ones that clashed or kinda counterbalanced each other. The inclusion of Ethan and Hila [Klein] was counter balanced by iDubbbz and Anisa," he added, referring to two creators who have publicly supported Palestine. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I made sure to contact both to make sure they were okay with the others' involvement so it didn’t feel like a weird gotcha on release," McMillen explained. "They were both very adult about it and said they had no issue with the other being added, and I really respected that, since I know they have been publicly feuding for a while now. It’s hard to explain without revealing aspects of the game people haven’t really experienced yet, but the inclusion of people with clashing ideologies felt appropriate."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McMillen concluded: "I understand we live in a time where a meow from someone who has different beliefs as you is scary and frustrating, confusing and controversial… but it felt interesting, so I decided to explore it. Also, I should probably point out that I don’t share the same opinions as, well, probably any of the people we included. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If I only included people who share the same exact opinions as me, I’d be the only one meowing in the game. I included Chris, but also liquid Chris (those who know, know)... I didn’t [realize] Matan [Evan, an Israeli-American YouTuber] was controversial, I mean a lot of these people are characters doing bits."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other notable inclusions on the list of vocal performers include Stranger Things star David Harbour and Supernatural's Felicia Day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN thought Mewgenics was 'Amazing.' <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-review"><u>It returned 9/10 in our review</u></a>, in which we wrote: "Mewgenics is a fantastic tactical RPG that's good for more than a hundred hours of roguelike runs. Just when you think you have it figured out it'll throw something completely unexpected and hilariously gross at you – and probably a catchy new original song, too."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And we're not the only ones having a good time with it; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-sells-over-150k-copies-in-first-6-hours-this-is-beating-expectations-by-quite-a-lot"><u>Mewgenics recouped all of its seven-year development costs within three hours of its launch on February 10</u></a>. "So far this is beating expectations by quite a lot," co-creator Tyler Glaiel told IGN. "It's a bigger launch than any of the Isaac expansions already, and it's only been a few hours."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
