            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld"><u>Palworld</u></a> has just pushed out a significant new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>patch</u></a>, bringing a collab with Ultrakill and a ton of improvements as developer Pocketpair continues work to prepare for the launch of Palworld 1.0, the game's eagerly-anticipated full release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">John “Bucky” Buckley, communications director and publishing manager, <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/2001127869259641322" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teased</u></a> that this update, dubbed Home Sweet Home, "puts a lot of groundwork in as we work towards our MASSIVE 1.0 release in 2026, but we have lots of little surprises in this update so check it out!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the Ultrakill collaboration, you'll find several "iconic weapons and armor," as well as a V1’s infamous coin toss, while the Home Sweet Home update — as the name suggests — makes it a little more intuitive to put down roots and make your own cozy base.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair said it had been "blown away by all the incredible builds that you guys have been sending us," and knows we've "been eagerly waiting for more freedom in how you design your base." That's why this update brings a number of new building parts, including the ability to change the color of building pieces and the "much-requested triangular pieces." The building menu UI has also been redesigned and reformatted into a list. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that's not all. Melee combat has been improved to make it "more viable and fun," and now, when summoning a raid boss at the Summoning Altar, players can choose to either fight at their base as before, or take on the raid boss in a special Raid Area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These Raid Areas allow you to fight with all your might, without risking any damage to your base," the team explained. "You can build temporary structures and take items into these special Raid Areas." Which is just as well, as a new raid boss will also pop up after the update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"2025 has been an incredible year for Palworld, and we’re excited to end the year with v0.7, Home Sweet Home!" Pocketpair exclaimed. "The purpose of this update is to begin improving existing features, and while this update may not be as content-rich as previous ones, we hope players understand that it’s necessary for us to begin laying the groundwork now as we work on the development of Palworld 1.0."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last but definitely not least, PvP! Though the studio admits PvP has been a topic of discussion in the Palworld community for a "long time," and it’s "hard to fully integrate PvP into the game," it is trying to make the dream a reality, albeit with some careful parameters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are releasing all the necessary tools for players to set up their own PvP rules on their own terms," Pocketpair said. "Show off your skills and compete with other Pal Tamers! Please note that PvP is experimental, and as such, there may be some balancing issues."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Palworld v0.7 patch notes:</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">ULTRAKILL Collab!</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added V1 and V2 armor sets!
