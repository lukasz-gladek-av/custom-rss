            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/niantic-spatial-lays-off-68-employees-following-sale-of-games-business-to-scopely<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Niantic Spatial, the tech company that remains of Niantic after it sold off its games business to Scopely last month, just laid off 68 people following the roughly $3.5 billion transaction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This news was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/niantic-is-laying-off-68-employees-after-selling-its-game-business-for-3-5-billion?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted by Game Developer</a> via a California WARN Act report, shows that at least 68 individuals are losing their jobs effect May 20, 2025. CEO John Hanke <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/niantic-spatial-evolve?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed the news by sharing an email</a> distributed to employees today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In it, he said that the layoffs came as a result of Niantic Spatial needing to "operate as a startup organization, focused on the road ahead", for which "some roles would not be required given our new focus." It's worth noting that Niantic was formed in 2010 under Google as Niantic Labs, and became independent in 2015.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These decisions are never easy; they in no way reflect the individuals’ performance, and we understand their impact on people’s lives," he continued. "We deeply appreciate the talented individuals who helped us get here and for their many contributions, and will support them as they transition to new opportunities."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These layoffs impact Niantic Spatial, which is the portion of Niantic that was spun off following the sale of Niantic's games business - including Pokemon Go, Monopoly Go!, and other games - to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-dev-moves-to-reassure-players-after-35-billion-sale-to-monopoly-go-company-is-confirmed">Scopely last month for over $3.5 billion</a>. Niantic Spatial's focus is on using geospatial artificial intelligence to develop new technology and products, something Niantic was already been doing for a while both outside of and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-players-have-been-training-an-ai-to-auto-complete-the-real-world">with the help of its games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Niantic Spatial was funded with $250 million of capital, $200 million from Niantic's balance sheet and a $50 million Scopely investment. Upon its announcement, the company said its intention was to "accelerate and scale even more rapidly".</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-just-picked-up-a-pokmon-tcg-151-booster-bundle-direct-from-amazon-and-its-still-in-stock<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But you'll have to pay a premium...</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I noticed Pokémon 151 booster bundles are back on Amazon, and I’d love to say that means good news for collectors. But when the price is more than double the MSRP, it's more of a raised eyebrow than a celebration. Amazon is listing the bundle for over $60, despite its actual retail price being $26.94. I guess we're calling that a "deal" now. Still, given how fast this set sells out, I can't entirely write it off.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-151-booster-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: 151 Booster Bundle">Pokémon TCG: 151 Booster Bundle Is Back In Stock For A Premium</h2></p><div catalogid="73e0a0eb-2c53-4af8-acce-e01289366c6e" id="218750"><div id="218750" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: 151 Booster Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Full Disclosure: MSRP is $26.94</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think what keeps pulling me back to 151 is that it's not just banking on nostalgia. It actually delivers. The card art in this set goes way beyond the usual shiny-thing-on-a-blank-background look. Take the Illustration Rare Bulbasaur, for example. It’s hiding in a jungle of giant leaves like it wandered into a Ghibli movie, and it works. Then there's Alakazam ex, who looks like it's working on a psychic PhD in a cluttered study. It's oddly charming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, the strongest part of this set is how it ties art and gameplay together without feeling like it’s trying too hard. Cards like Blastoise ex have solid abilities and look like they belong in a gallery. Even Charmander got an upgrade. The new one has 70 HP, which might not sound like a big deal, but it’s enough to keep it alive against chip damage that would've knocked out weaker versions. Subtle but important, which kind of sums up a lot of this set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not everything hits. Zapdos ex is fine, but I wouldn’t frame it or build a deck around it. Still, the overall quality is high. Venusaur ex leans into both function and flair, while Squirtle’s artwork pulls off that rare trick of making a cartoon turtle look like it belongs in an actual ecosystem. It’s hard not to appreciate how much care went into these designs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t love paying above MSRP, but I also don’t love pretending this set isn’t loaded. I think if you’ve been waiting for packs that are genuinely fun to open and have a real shot at high-value pulls, this is still one of the better buys. Assuming you're okay with the price of admission being whatever Amazon feels like charging today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/skull-and-bones-to-add-land-combat-this-fall-as-ubisoft-outlines-year-2-content-plans<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft is plotting a course to make <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/skull-and-bones"><u>Skull and Bones</u></a> Year 2 the pirate multiplayer game’s biggest yet thanks to major content additions like new modes, ships, a Kraken, and something fans have begged for since launch: land combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft opened its treasure chest of plans for the next year of updates during a special Year 2 showcase that premiered yesterday. Its presentation was packed with content to look forward to, but it’s Season 3: Guts and Glory that promises the land combat feature players have hoped to see included since Skull and Bones originally launched last February.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During Season 3 this fall, Ubisoft will finally allow players to take the action away from the sea, meaning you’ll be able to swordfight and even draw your firearms against others. It’s all part of Season 3’s Rogue Warlord additions, which will see players setting foot on sandy beaches and damp caves to rescue skilled crewmembers known as Officers. A video teasing the feature showed a bit of what players can expect, but it’s clear we’ll have to wait until later this year to see how it all works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While land combat is by far the biggest addition coming with Skull and Bones Year 2, the presentation had plenty more to keep players digging throughout 2025. Season 1 sets sail today, April 15, with Ascent into Chaos, which adds a loot-enhancing item ascension feature, challenging World Tiers, a new Schooner medium ship, and the team-based Death Tides PvP mode. Season 2: Oaths of War, which launches summer 2025, includes highlights such as Megaforts and the gargantuan Frigate large ships, with Season 4: Eye of the Beast set to introduce the Kraken, Hunter’s Guild, and Corvette large ship this winter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If everything you’ve heard sounds enticing enough to dive in, you’ll be happy to know Skull and Bones will launch a free weekend in just a few days. From April 17 – 21, players can raise sails to try out pirate PvP for themselves and also purchase the game at a reduced price (which has yet to be announced).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skull and Bones launched February 16, 2024, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S (we gave it a 7/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skull-and-bones-review"><u>our review</u></a>). Although Ubisoft has been reluctant to share official sales stats for its latest pirate adventure game, it did <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-skull-and-bones-has-record-player-engagement-but-fails-to-announce-sales"><u>tease that it managed to bring in “record player engagement” shortly after its release</u></a>. Interestingly, the launch of Skull and Bones also coincided with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-players-rise-200-upon-skull-and-bones-release"><u>a 200% increase in Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag players</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
