            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has officially opened UK preorders for the upcoming <a href="https://zdcs.link/QP80eW?object_uuid=6759bd5a-229b-4dc1-872c-d1166ea1e967&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Donkey Kong &amp; Pauline amiibo</u></a>, launching the same day as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza"><u>Donkey Kong Bananza</u></a>, on July 17, 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Releasing alongside a highly anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> exclusive, the amiibo is now available through the My Nintendo Store UK for £16.99, with orders capped at three per customer.</p><div catalogid="7494b342-1f3a-4ee1-bf9d-f09d216cca49" id="223987"><div id="223987" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Donkey Kong &amp; Pauline amiibo</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like other amiibo, though, a unique dual-character figure doesn’t just look great on your shelf. It also unlocks in-game content for Donkey Kong Bananza. Most notably, this includes the Diva Dress costume for Pauline, which grants the ability to make the appearance of discs after defeating an enemy twice as likely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s more, the Diva Dress is very noticeably styled after Pauline’s dress in Super Mario Odyssey, likely to further <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-finally-confirmed-by-nintendo-sparking-questions-over-when-switch-2s-3d-mario-will-arrive"><u>speculation that Donkey Kong Bananza is indeed a prequel to the 2017 hit Mario game</u></a>, especially since both games have been made by the same team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all. By scanning either the new DK-Pauline amiibo, the Power-Up Bands from Super Nintendo World, or any of the other Donkey Kong series amiibo; solo Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, King K. Rool, etc; gold “KONG” tiles with explosive power will appear. You can hurl these during gameplay to wreak extra havoc in the game’s many environments, and add an extra tactical edge to DK’s new adventure.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo also confirmed during its dedicated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Donkey Kong Bananza Direct</u></a> that the game supports every previously released amiibo. Scanning non-DK series figures will instead get you giant material balls, which you can also make DK throw to traverse certain stages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Preorders on the My Nintendo Store UK include standard delivery for £1.99 or free shipping if your order hits £20 or more. If you were planning on ordering any other DK figures (like those above), or games, like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-pokemon-legends-z-a-preorders-exclusive-mega-evolution-bundle-uk"><u>various bundles for Pokemon Legends: Z-A</u></a>, you may as preorder one of those now and save yourself a few pounds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve checked by adding both items to my basket testing the checkout and, even though Pokemon Legends: Z-A is releasing later than the Donkey Kong &amp; Pauline amiibo on October 16 (meaning both will arrive via separate deliveries), shipping will still be free for the entire order.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The amiibo announcement follows a jam-packed Nintendo Direct showcasing Donkey Kong Bananza’s return to 3D platforming. New features include wild Bananza transformations, skill trees, a costume shop, and the creative DK Artist Mode where players sculpt and paint items and characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza drops in just a couple of weeks, and with this amiibo, you’ll be more than ready to swing into action and have a cool figure in your display.</p></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 4, 2025 7:28 am</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-pauline-amiibo-up-for-uk-preorder-at-1699-with-bananza-bonuses]]></content:encoded>
