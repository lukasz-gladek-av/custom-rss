            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has been dropping some very nice gaming deals recently to start off 2026. The latest offer to catch our eye is on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> for <a href="https://zdcs.link/av8Px2?object_uuid=b1f0f738-ab4a-4a9e-9cc1-28425d8f0bfd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D187PJHJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YRrdj?object_uuid=b1f0f738-ab4a-4a9e-9cc1-28425d8f0bfd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D18PNXNL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X</a>, which have both dropped to $19.99 for a limited time. This marks a return to the lowest price for both <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0D187PJHJ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS5</a> and <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0D18PNXNL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Series X</a> versions at Amazon, so this is a great opportunity to grab it. And why not spend these next few winter months journeying to a galaxy far, far away?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Star Wars Outlaws (PS5 and Xbox Series X) for $20</h2><div id="234225" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="b60d2672-d5e2-45da-94c2-d03afc9b244c"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws - Limited Edition (Amazon Exclusive), PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><div catalogid="b60d2672-d5e2-45da-94c2-d03afc9b244c" id="234226"><div id="234226" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws - Limited Edition (Amazon Exclusive), Xbox Series X</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Amazon Exclusive limited edition release of Star Wars Outlaws comes with some extras alongside the game. This version will set you up with The Rogue Infiltrator Character Pack, which features cosmetics for Kay and Nix that you can use in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still wondering if this is the game for you? Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review">review</a> from IGN's Tristan Ogilvie called it a "fun intergalactic heist adventure with great exploration," though he noted at the time that it was "hindered by simple stealth, repetitive combat, and a few too many bugs at launch." However, since launch, it's received <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-patch-cuts-stealth-objectives-improves-ai-and-more-in-huge-title-update-140">updates</a> to give it a bit of a boost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned before, this isn't the only video game deal to cross our radar over at Amazon. The retailer has had quite a few surprises up its sleeve recently, including a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-slashes-50-off-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-as-a-little-new-years-treat">very big discount on Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-delightful-astro-bot-for-ps5-is-back-to-its-best-price-at-amazon-and-walmart">Astro Bot</a>. Outside of Amazon, Walmart's even offering a great <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-dropped-to-just-40-in-the-new-year-sales">deal at the moment on Battlefield 6</a>, if you've been waiting for a good time to add that to your library.
