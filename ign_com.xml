            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-dev-seemingly-teases-snoop-dogg-appearance-in-project-century<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yakuza / Like a Dragon developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio appears to be teasing a Snoop Dogg appearance in its mysterious new game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/project-century-rgg">Project Century</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RGG Studio posted a photo of Snoop wearing the distinctive jacket worn by the protagonist in the Project Century trailer. At the same time, studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama posted a photo of himself in the jacket, mirroring the pose of Snoop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Snoop photo has the teasing caption "...yet," while Yokoyama's, in Japanese, said: "please wait a bit, yeah?" It's not the tease RGG Studio fans were expecting of Project Century, which appears to be a new series potentially connected to Yakuza / Like a Dragon but set in 1915, given it was only revealed at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-everything-announced">The Game Awards 2024</a> a few days ago, but there are some elements which aren't completely bizarre.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="und" dir="ltr">"...yet." <a href="https://t.co/PZVRac0ag9" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/PZVRac0ag9</a></p>— RGG Studio | Like a Dragon &amp; Yakuza Series (@RGGStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/RGGStudio/status/1868824408225382702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Snoop was also at The Game Awards 2024, for example, where he performed a medley of songs to the developers and press in attendance. It's therefore likely the photo was taken there, and could be as simple as him liking the jacket and wanting a photo in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this isn't the first time Snoop Dogg's name has been brought up in relation to the Yakuza / Like a Dragon series. Following on from Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which featured Danny Trejo as the likeness and voice for villain Dwight Méndez, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-asks-yakuzalike-a-dragon-fans-if-they-want-celebs-like-keanu-reeves-and-mark-hamill-in-next-game">publisher Sega asked fans which other celebrities they'd like to appear</a> in the series going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside video game adjacent stars such as Keanu Reeves, Mark Hamill, Jack Black, Rami Malek, and David Hayter came other celebrities, one of which was none other than Snoop Dogg. This tease could therefore be the end result of this poll, though nothing is confirmed yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Snoop would likely appear as a new character and not just as a cameo of himself, especially if he does show up in Project Century since it's set 56 years before he was born. Little is known about the game, however, so anything is possible.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">ちょっと待ってね <a href="https://t.co/N2hkLB5Z53" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/N2hkLB5Z53</a></p>— 横山昌義 (@yokoyama_masa) <a href="https://twitter.com/yokoyama_masa/status/1868823727687057888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-fans-are-already-theorizing-what-the-heck-rgg-studios-project-century-is">RGG Studio fans are already deep in the theorizing phase to figure out what the heck Project Century is</a>, of course, and already have ideas on where it's set, if it's connected to the Yakuza / Like a Dragon franchise, who it's main character is, and if it's using the developer's Dragon Engine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They'll have to be patient for these answers though. Project Century is probably still a while away given it doesn't have a title yet, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-set-to-take-on-street-fighter-and-tekken-once-again-with-virtua-fighter-the-game-awards-2024">RGG Studio is currently developing Virtua Fighter 6</a> and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii alongside it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is known for its unbelievably speedy development times, however. In the last five years, for example, its released Yakuza 4 Remastered, Yakuza 5 Remastered, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Judgment Remastered, Lost Judgment, Like a Dragon: Ishin, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, alongside three Super Monkey Ball Games and an enhanced remaster of Virtua Fighter 5. That's 12 games in total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">In our 9/10 review of the last RGG Studio release</a>, IGN said: "Sprawling, enthralling, and packed with dynamic brawling, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth isn’t just the best turn-based Like a Dragon game, it’s one of the greatest games in the entire series."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Based on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-were-done-with-it-as-a-team-guerrilla-dev-explains-why-the-studio-moved-on-from-killzone-to-horizon">recent comments from one developer</a>, however, we perhaps now know why.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Helldivers 2 spoilers ahead!</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 dataminer <a href="https://x.com/Iron_S1ghts" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iron_S1ghts</a> tweeted details on the unannounced Righteous Revenants Warbond, which include armor that features the gas masks and red eyes that will be instantly recognizable as belonging to the Helghast, Killzone’s villainous enemy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cementing the leak as legitimate is the telltale asset takedown following a request from the “copyright holder,” in this case Sony.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">(Leak) Righteous Revenants Warbond<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Helldivers2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Helldivers2</a> <a href="https://t.co/QGd4ElinAe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/QGd4ElinAe</a></p>— IronS1ghts (@Iron_S1ghts) <a href="https://twitter.com/Iron_S1ghts/status/1867412305195282746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Killzone feels like a great fit for Helldivers 2, and this leaked crossover has already sparked excitement among fans that Sony may be ready to return to the franchise. Alas, developer Guerrilla Games has its hands full with the Horizon Online project and the inevitable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">Horizon 3</a>, so if Sony does have plans for more Killzone, it will probably have to come from another developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starship-troopers-terminator-warhammer-40000-helldivers-2-creative-director-reveals-his-dream-crossovers">Arrowhead CCO and Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt cautioned against doing too many crossovers</a>, saying “it would dilute the IP and make it a ‘not Helldivers’ experience.” However, he also published an extended list of IPs he “really would love to do a take on!” Killzone, perhaps understandably, was not on the list, below:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Aliens</li><li>Starship Troopers</li><li>Terminator</li><li>Predator</li><li>Star Wars</li><li>Fifth Element</li><li>Blade Runner</li><li>Warhammer 40k</li><li>Trench Crusade</li><li>Mutant Chronicles</li><li>Dropzone Commander</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 is currently enjoying a resurgence after the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-adds-new-faction-illuminate-in-omens-of-tyranny-update-and-its-out-now-the-game-awards-2024">the long-awaited Illuminate update</a>, which adds a third faction for players to fight against. Expect plenty more from the explosive third-person shooter, which remains the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with an incredible 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, in the months ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-admits-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-anti-cheat-did-not-hit-the-mark-at-the-launch-of-season-1<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision has outlined the steps it’s taken to combat cheating in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 after Ranked Mode came under fire by fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ranked, Black Ops 6’s most competitive Multiplayer mode, began November 21 but<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-cheat-complaints-ramp-up-activision-says-its-doing-hourly-sweeps-to-stem-the-tide"> reaction so far has been largely negative</a>. This is because of the apparent prevalence of cheaters who are ruining the integrity of the mode. And yes, as has become Call of Duty tradition, console players are turning off crossplay in a bid to avoid PC cheaters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/12/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-update-december" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Activision’s Team Ricochet, the division responsible for its Call of Duty anti-cheat tech, admitted not enough had been done to prevent cheating with the launch of Season 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After a series of updates our systems are in a better place today across all modes; however, we did not hit the mark for the integration of Ricochet Anti-Cheat at the launch of Season 01 — particularly for Ranked Play,” Activision said. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We understand the promise of glory and notoriety from Ranked Play leaderboards makes Ranked Play an attractive target for cheaters. For this reason, our teams have been especially focused on turning the tide to deliver the competitive arena our players seek.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision said account bans are now happening hourly due to increased “velocity” from several Ricochet Anti-Cheat systems, in addition to the over 19,000 accounts it’s removed recently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cleanup of the Ranked leaderboards, which has suffered greatly from cheaters, is now faster, Activision said. And Activision has “significantly expanded” its Replay Investigation render farm (the machines used to generate clips for examination.) The company said it’s also ramped up the group dedicated to manually reviewing clips based on a priority order that favors detections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the last several weeks, the Replay tool updates have been highly effective at validating detections and reports, providing further training for AI systems for the anti-cheat team, and removing cheaters,” Activision added.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The things you work so hard to earn (Ranked Play status, camos, etc.) are attractive targets to cheaters who want nice things but don’t like to put in the work.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision also promised more updates to come for its Ricochet Anti-Cheat systems, including its kernel-level driver and brand-new server-side protections. These are set to launch during Season 2 and 3. In the meantime, Activision encouraged players to enable 2FA on their account, and report cheaters in-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The things you work so hard to earn (Ranked Play status, camos, etc.) are attractive targets to cheaters who want nice things but don’t like to put in the work,” Activision said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Ricochet Anti-Cheat team will be continuing its work to fight cheaters throughout the remainder of the month. While we have made progress, we know more needs to be done and we’re eager to share details of our planned major updates coming in the new year.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most Activision anti-cheat updates are met with a healthy dose of scepticism from hardcore fans, and this latest one is no different. Cheating is not unique to Call of Duty of course, but it has become a significant reputation issue for Activision ever since the free-to-download battle royale Warzone exploded in popularity back in 2020. The mega publisher has spent millions of dollars developing its anti-cheat technology as well as pursuing cheat makers in the courts, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name"><u>a number of recent high-profile successes</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October, ahead of the launch of Black Ops 6, Activision said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-it-wants-to-catch-and-remove-call-of-duty-cheaters-within-1-hour-of-them-being-in-their-first-match"><u>it aimed to kick cheaters out of the game within one hour of them being in their first match</u></a>. Black Ops 6 launched with an updated version of Ricochet's kernel-level driver (this also applied to Warzone), with new machine-learning behavioral systems focused on speed of detection and the analysis of gameplay to combat aim bots in place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The people behind cheats are organized, illegal groups that pick apart every piece of data within our games to look for some way to make cheating possible," Activision said at the time. "These bad guys are not just some script kiddies poking around with code they found online. They are a collective who profit from exploiting the hard work of game developers across the industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But cheat developers are flawed (clearly — they have to pretend to be good at video games). Every time they cheat, they leave breadcrumbs behind. We’re always looking for those breadcrumbs to find the bad actors and get them out of the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Developer Creatures Inc. has still added myriad new missions and solo battles for players to interact with though, which somewhat recreates that opening day feeling of the digital trading card game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of special cards added with Mythical Island too, which despite adding 86 cards total officially caps out at 68 cards. This means there are 18 of the "secrete" alternate art cards, including one immersive and one crown card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the mission front, Mythical Island Dex Missions have been added which, just like Genetic Apex, reward players with special shop tickets for collecting five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, and 60 unique Mythical Island cards. These can be used to redeem a Mew icon.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Mythical Island</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Deck Missions are added too, rewarding players with Rental Decks for collecting some of the major new cards available in Mythical Island including Celebi ex, Gyarados ex, Mew ex, Aerodactyl ex, and Pidgeot ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Themed Collections are also updated for Mythical Island. A variety of missions here reward different items for collecting, well, themed collections of cards, such as the Flower Travelers mission tasking players with collecting the three flower Pokémon in the Florges evolution line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Solo Battles at the Step-Up and Expert tiers have also been updated with new challenges. Eight new Step-Up Battles have been added for Mythical Island decks, with players able to take on the second most challenging versions of decks such as Celebi ex and Mew ex to earn rewards such as pack hourglasses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another eight decks are added at the Expert Battle tier, which each reward seven Pack Hourglasses upon completion. The Step-Up Battles offer five, so a total of 96 Pack Hourglasses are available in solo battles alone, letting players open eight booster packs at no cost. This comes on top of 12 Pack Hourglasses that Creatures Inc. offered as free gift to all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Wonder Picks, these now appear to only serve Mythical Island packs and no longer Genetic Apex, though it's possible the new set is just dominating the random selection since the majority of players are presumably opening it on launch day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other changes to the game will emerge over the coming days, as the 86 new cards are slotted into the meta and shake up the player versus player scene. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-cower-as-mythical-island-expansion-threatens-to-make-misty-even-stronger">A new Vaporeon card is already threatening to make Misty even more powerful</a>, while Aerodactyl ex may lead Pokémon TCG Pocket's first control deck by stopping players evolving their Active Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived October 30 and is a certified hit for Creatures Inc. and The Pokémon Company, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">having earned an estimated $200 million in its first month</a> across more than 60 million downloads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This huge amount of money comes as Pokémon TCG Pocket follows the standard mobile and free to play game model, flooding players with rewards in the first few days before soon drying up, with spending real world money the only real way to re-experience that early thrill outside of the occasional set drop like this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing Genetic Apex, the first set of cards which totals 226 officially but also contains 60 rare alternate art cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take players not spending money around two years according to one estimate</a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-player-reveals-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-complete-the-first-set-after-spending-1500">those looking to make it rain can wrap up the collection after dropping around $1,500</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
