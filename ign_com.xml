And it turns out, they actually did write a cameo for Big the Cat into the second Sonic the Hedgehog film... only for it to be a bit too grim to make it to the final cut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In one draft of Sonic 2, we actually, when they're going through the snowy mountains to the cave, we had a bit, because Sonic 2 was sort of an Indiana Jones," Casey told us. "Indiana Jones, it's a trope that at some point a skeleton pops out at you and scares you. So we were going to do that, but with a skeleton of a, I would say,<em> a</em> Big the Cat, not necessarily-"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Miller cuts in here, "Not necessarily <em>the</em> Big the Cat."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>"</strong>But we ended up cutting it," Casey concludes. "It didn't make any sense."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, we almost had a... dead Big the Cat in Sonic 2. The two writers said that "Big the Cat" is usually their joke answer when fans ask them who they want to add to the films, though they also informed me they've been unsuccessfully trying to get Rouge the Bat in as well for three fims straight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keep your eyes here at IGN for our full interview with Casey and Miller coming later this week, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-3">all the latest on the Sonic the Hedgehog movies</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

But while Titus appears in the animation as he looks in Space Marine 2, the episode also features a weapon players have yet to see in-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds innocuous, but the action scene in which this mystery Power Axe is used steals the show. We see it wielded with brutal efficiency to tear apart cultists and Tzaangors. There’s even a super cool moment in which a Space Marine bashes the helm of the axe in order to shift it into the upright position in his glove.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>THIS is why I’m a fan of Warhammer 40k!

So far, neither has indicated plans to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Modders, as they so often do, have stepped into the breach. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40000spacemarine2/mods/89" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Astartes 2.0</u></a>, from Space Marine 2 modder Warhammer Workshop, has just released a new update that adds the much-anticipated Power Axe, inspired by Secret Level, to the game, as well as the Chain-Axe and the Space King’s Hate Mace complete with its unique heraldry. (Space King is a fan-made Warhammer 40,000 parody.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generally, the Astartes overhaul mod adds loads of new content, including lore-accurate Space Marine classes, reworked combat, and even new missions. Space Marine 2 has a thriving modding scene that makes a significant number of improvements and changes to the record-breaking third-person melee / shooter hybrid. IGN has reported on Space Marine 2’s modding scene a number of times, shining a light on everything from more in-depth customization to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-mod-solves-one-of-the-games-biggest-problems"><u>a fix for one of the game’s biggest problems</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-patch-5-makes-big-balance-changes-completely-reworks-blocking-weapons">Space Marine 2 is now up to Patch 5</a>, although Focus has already talked about what to expect from Patch 6 and 7, both due out in 2025. The Year 1 roadmap for Space Marine 2 includes new content up to Season 4, which is set to kick off at some point in 2025 (we're currently in Season 2). Space Marine 2 is set for long-term support, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dataminers-are-having-a-field-day-uncover-information-up-to-season-9">dataminers have uncovered information on cosmetics set to hit the game up to Season 9</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/following-stalker-2s-success-developer-gsc-game-world-contends-with-this-new-reality<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We now have a really big audience."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl">Stalker 2</a> is a hit. Officially, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-already-sold-1-million-copies-with-many-more-playing-on-xbox-game-pass">it’s sold one million copies across PC and Xbox Series X and S</a>, with many more playing on Game Pass. Reports coming out of Ukraine, where developer GSC Game World was originally based before Russia’s full-scale invasion of the country in 2022, indicate Stalker 2 is already profitable. There’s even talk of a Netflix series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what does this success mean for GSC Game World itself and the future of Stalker 2? IGN interviewed GSC CEO Ievgen Grygorovych and creative director Maria Grygorovych at BAFTA in Piccadilly, London following a screening of <a href="https://youtu.be/28CITqxwNz0?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</u></a>, to ask if Stalker 2’s big sales were a game-changer for the developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussing the impact of Stalker 2’s release in English, which is obviously not their first language, Ievgen  and Maria talked about how the studio now faces “a new reality” and with it a bigger audience than it’s ever had to contend with. The first steps as part of this new reality will revolve around working to improve Stalker 2 itself, something GSC has already done with multiple patches, but also to expand its plans for continued support.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/23/20241202-202049-1733223547947-1734961939345.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Ievgen and Maria Grygorovych, far right, discuss the making of Stalker 2 at BAFTA 195 Piccadilly. Photo by IGN.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“You need to think properly because we now have a really big audience and sometimes different parts of this audience want to see different things,” Maria cautioned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So we need to live now with this new reality, with a live community and talking with them and try to understand them maybe deeper because we really want to make our relationship good.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ievgen went into more detail, saying that while GSC’s plan for the development of future video games remains unchanged, it plans to invest even more in post-launch support of Stalker 2 than it had previously earmarked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Around five years ago or maybe six years ago, we had a plan of what we were going to do in the nearest 10, 15 years,” he revealed. “What projects we want to do, how we're going to look like. And all these years we are slightly updating this plan by just moving the dates forward until we release the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And so six years passed and we still want to do the same games as we planned earlier and nothing changed. The only things that changed is that we didn't think that we would like to invest much more time in live updates of Stalker 2 after game release, that we would want to add much more things in this game in live updates.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this mean for Stalker 2 and its players, then? Ievgen confirmed that GSC is now in a position to add ideas it was forced to cut from the game before launch because they weren’t ready, and even add new ideas that have sprung up in the wake of Stalker 2’s release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We didn't expect that we would go back to improving Stalker 2 for a lot,” Ievgen explained. “And now we still have the same plan for 10, 15 years of development of other things we want. But also putting much more in development of Stalker 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because actually I love the world we built. I still find a lot of things that we can make better and we want to make better. And now we have players for whom we can do that, for whom we have to do that. And for me it's very driving.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/499129/stalker-2-gsc-game-world-profitable-dlc-expansions-multiplayer-netflix" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">same reports coming out of Ukraine</a> suggest Stalker 2 will get at least two expansions and even multiplayer, which may be one of the ideas Ievgen was talking about. The hope, it seems, is that Stalker 2’s success could help put Ukraine on the game development map, as CD Projekt’s The Witcher 2 had done for Poland.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, updates to fix issues with Stalker 2 continue, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-patch-11-is-a-big-one-adds-first-iteration-of-a-life-fixes">a much-needed patch that improved the crucial A-Life 2.0 feature</a>. Previously, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam">GSC explained what went wrong with Stalker 2’s A-Life 2.0</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
