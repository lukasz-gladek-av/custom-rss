It‚Äôs a game that leans heavily on its physics systems and the emergent gameplay that comes from them, and that includes being blasted around the map.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As any Helldivers 2 player will know, you spend a lot of time prone on the floor recovering after being smashed into a ragdolling status. There‚Äôs a panic that sets in as you slowly pick yourself up and dust yourself off while the forces of the Illuminate, the Automatons, and the Terminids continue their assault. Those precious few milliseconds may make all the difference, especially on harder difficulties.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the flag can now be ‚Äúproudly‚Äù planted directly into enemies ‚Äî dead or alive ‚Äî ‚Äúensuring the eternal colors of Super Earth are never tainted, only quenched by the blood of its foes.‚Äù So, if you want that Charger to be running around with your flag on its back, now you can make it happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of balance changes worth checking out in the patch notes below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things are hotting up in the world of Helldivers 2, with the PC and PS5 game set to become the first PlayStation Studios-published title ever on Xbox <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-published-helldivers-2-gets-shock-release-date-on-xbox-series-x-and-s">when it launches on Series X and S next month alongside crossplay</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 update 01.003.200 patch notes:</p><h2 data-cy="title1">üåç Overview</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Balancing</li><li>Mission Fixes</li><li>Weapon Fixes</li><li>Miscellaneous Fixes</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">‚öñÔ∏è Balancing</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">General</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Helldiver</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced the time it takes for the Helldiver to regain control after ragdolling from 0.8 to 0.5 sec</li><li>Increased chest injury bleed damage from 1 to 10.

It's who you did it to.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The only officially licensed John Wick video game is being removed from sale just six years after launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bithell Games‚Äô well-received <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/john-wick-hex">John Wick Hex</a> launched in October 2019. It‚Äôs a fast-paced, action-oriented strategy game ‚Äúthat makes you think and strike like John Wick.‚Äù John Wick, of course, is the hugely popular action hero made famous by Keanu Reeves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward six years and John Wick Hex is set for the digital scrapheap. In an update directed at the game‚Äôs community, publisher Big Fan Games (which is part of Devolver Digital) said John Wick Hex will be removed from sale on all platforms beginning July 17, 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After July 17, existing owners of John Wick Hex will still be able to access the game via their digital libraries across PC and console, and of course physical copies will continue to work on console. However, new purchases of John Wick Hex will not be possible, regardless of platform or storefront.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Fan Games failed to say why John Wick Hex was being removed from sale, but it seems likely it's the result of the expiration of its licence with John Wick rights holder Lionsgate Entertainment. IGN has asked Big Fan for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The expiration of a licence is one of the main reasons video games end up being pulled from storefronts; you see it most often with video games that have licensed music. It happened to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/alan-wake-to-be-removed-from-stores-because-of-expiring-licenses">Alan Wake</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/renewed-concern-for-star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-as-trailers-and-tweets-are-culled">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake trailers</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spec-ops-the-line-will-no-longer-be-available-in-online-stores-2k-blames-expiring-partnerships">Spec Ops: The Line</a>, to name but a few. Video game preservationists often call for video game companies to do more to keep their products alive when this happens.
