            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2’s long-awaited Siege Mode is out now across all platforms alongside Patch 8, which makes some significant changes to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Siege is a take on the classic horde mode, and sees teams of three Space Marine players battle waves of Tyranids and Chaos Marines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the first significant new mode to hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a> since its hugely successful release last year, and for publisher Focus Entertainment and developer Saber Interactive, it will hopefully breathe new life into the explosive co-op shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Saber has made some key changes to the way Siege mode works compared to the version playable as part of the Public Test Server (PTS). “The biggest criticism regarding Siege mode from the community was the wave timer limit,” Saber explained. “It exists only for technical reasons. In this build we've made some optimizations so the Siege mode can last longer.” Full details are in the patch notes below, as per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500576552635859479" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Siege mode itself, alongside its exclusive cosmetic rewards, are free, but there are new paid cosmetics (White Scars Chapter Champion and Blood Angels Customisation Pack). Elsewhere, Space Marine 2 finally has Ray Traced Ambient Occlusion (RTAO) and DLSS 4 support (better upscale, multiframe generation in Nvidia settings for 50xx series cards) on PC, and there’s the introduction of the Thunder Hammer for the Bulwark class (which the developers added <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-devs-tear-up-the-rulebook-let-the-bulwark-class-use-a-thunder-hammer-only-because-we-think-it-will-be-very-cool">simply because they thought it was cool</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Saber has indicated, it’s working on a “very big” update for customisation that lets players reuse chapter champion armour parts on other classes (with lore accuracy, clipping and technical restrictions). It’s not in Patch 8, so perhaps we can expect it in Patch 9.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 White Scars and Blood Angels Cosmetics</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-sells-7-million-in-less-than-a-year-and-you-can-see-why-space-marine-3-was-confirmed-so-soon">Space Marine 2 has sold an impressive 7 million copies so far</a>. It’s done so well it “changes everything” for Saber, Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN soon after the game came out last September. It was also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-made-millions-for-games-workshop-now-its-on-the-hunt-for-the-next-big-warhammer-video-game"><u>a big financial success for Warhammer 40,000 owner Games Workshop</u></a>. CEO Kevin Rountree has said Space Marine 2 contributed significant royalty revenue to the tabletop company's business last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Focus and Saber surprised some Space Marine 2 fans when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive"><u>it announced Space Marine 3 was in development</u></a> back in March, half a year after the game came out. But given the huge sales you can see why the project was greenlit so soon. "Space Marine 2 has proven to be a transformative game for Saber," Matthew Karch, CEO of Saber Interactive, said at the time. Still, Focus and Saber had to put out a statement reassuring players of its commitment to Space Marine 2, which is still working through its year one roadmap of content. Without spoiling the Space Marine 2 campaign, it strongly suggests a continuation (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-have-a-good-idea-which-enemy-faction-theyll-fight-in-space-marine-3"><u>IGN has reported on the enemy faction we’ll probably see in Space Marine 3</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Space Marine 2 players are wondering what else is coming to the game. Patch 8 does not add any new weapons or Operations mode maps, so it seems the focus here is squarely on Siege. But Saber has confirmed new content is on the way, including a new class. Season 4 also includes a new game mode for PvP and a new Chaos enemy.

When overwhelmed, players may call reinforcements for assistance. Engage in intense battles across three distinctive sectors, each requiring strategic adaptation. Side objectives emerge during combat, providing essential resources used to summon elite Space Marines or a formidable Dreadnought, drastically shifting battlefield dynamics.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>The Battlefield</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The battle unfolds within a fortified Imperial stronghold on Kadaku, relentlessly attacked by endless waves of Tyranid and Thousand Sons enemies. The fortress has three rotating sectors: Defensive Positions, the Arsenal, and the Control Room. In each sector, you will face five waves of enemies before your squad advances to the next sector, ultimately cycling back to reinforce earlier positions.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Survival Against Waves</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Face increasingly challenging enemy waves, with direct assaults from Tyranids and cunning sabotage by Chaos forces. Brief (1 minute) intermissions between waves offer strategic opportunities, clearly indicated through UI notifications.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Side Objectives</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Dynamic tasks such as capturing strategic points or retrieving Data-slates from fallen allies deepen tactical gameplay and supply critical resources essential for continued survival.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Shop and Reinforcements</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Earn Siege Mode resources through successful combat and Side Objective completion. You can spend these resources at the fortress Shop. You can:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Buy ammunition, medicae stimms, equipment, armour boosts, guardian relic (these items have the same exact behaviour as in Operations Mode).</li><li>Summon specialized Space Marines providing targeted support and bonuses. Each player can have only one summoned Space Marine.</li><li>Deploy Cadian Troopers to provide additional firepower. </li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><u><em>Note about reinforcements changes from the PTS</em></u>: guardsmen are now cheaper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">4. Collectively pool your resources to unleash the devastating power of a Dreadnought.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Boss Encounters</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Every fifth wave introduces formidable boss battles, occasionally facing multiple elite foes simultaneously. Triumph in these encounters to progress to new fortress sectors.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Infinite Waves</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If your resolve endures through fifteen brutal waves, prepare for endless combat of increasing difficulty, reduced resources, and shorter preparation times. Even the Primarch of the Ultramarines understands that ultimate victory here is unlikely — but your bravery will echo through the halls of eternity.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><em>Note about timer changes from PTS:</em></u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The biggest criticism regarding Siege mode from the community was the wave timer limit. It exists only for technical reasons. In this build we've made some optimizations so the Siege mode can last longer.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Timer got reworked, instead of having a limited timer per wave that can get to a very short time on higher waves, there is a timer for the entire session and each time you beat a wave the timer increases.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We've also adjusted the difficulty curve of infinite waves so enemies will get stronger faster after the 15th wave. These changes will make players die in fair combat rather than due to the timer. Also, with some optimizations coming down later we think we can get rid of the timer entirely.</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added an option to disable bots spawn in Private Mode</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Perfect if you’re looking for a challenge.</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>RTAO experimental feature added — enables in in-game video settings</li><li>DLSS 4  — better upscale, multiframe generation in NVIDIA settings for 50xx series cards.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Season Pass Content</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added White Scars Chapter Champion. </li><li>Added White Scars Chapter Weapon Skin Pack. </li><li>Added White Scars Chapter Customisation Pack. </li><li>Added Blood Angels Customisation Pack.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">GAMEPLAY AND BALANCING TWEAKS</h3><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Extended Weapon arsenal in PvE</strong> </h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added Thunder Hammer for Bulwark. Picking this weapon won’t allow you to use the Storm Shield.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We are adding this option only because we think it will be very cool and it's a shame that only 1 class can use the Thunder Hammer. We are not done with Bulwark, more interesting gameplay things are to come.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>New Finishers for Bulwark</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Adding new finishers for Bulwark with shield — 1 for Hormagaunt and 1 for Tzaangor.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Terminus Update for Absolute Difficulty</strong> </h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>A second Terminus can now appear during a mission.</li><li>Carnifex, Neurothrope and Helbrute HP increased by 33% on Absolute difficulty.</li><li>Level specific Terminus enemies (with the exception of the Hierophant Bio-Titan) HP increased by 66% on Absolute difficulty.</li><li>Additional enemy packs will appear upon Terminus enemies spawn and again when their HP is reduced to 50%</li><li>These additional packs are now slightly more challenging featuring more Extremis enemies</li><li>Mission with final bosses can now also spawn Terminus enemies (previously, missions like “Decapitation” didn't allow any Terminus spawns)".</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This change is made according to the community poll that we made a while ago. We think that Absolute difficulty wasn't that hard to begin with and now with a slight power creep of constant weapons buffs, perk buffs and prestige perks the situation is much worse.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>After doing multiple test we have scrapped the idea of having 2 Terminus enemies in Operations mode at the same time (except in Siege mode), because this meant that you would have to encounter them all of the time, otherwise one run with dual terminus spawns would be much harder than a run with 2 Terminus enemies spawning one by one. We are increasing the health of the Terminus enemies on Absolute difficulty because they often can die before even dealing any damage. While this may seem like it goes against poll results, keep in mind that if we had 2 Terminus enemies, that would effectively be +100%  hp buff. Also we are nerfing Neurothrope base hp across all difficulty levels so its hp pool won’t become a problem for melee classes.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Instead we've tried to make Terminus spawns harder and more intense. We are going to continue to monitor how Absolute Difficulty is, and make necessary tweaks.</em></p><h2 data-cy="title2">Prestige Perks Class Update</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Bulwark Prestige Perks Update</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>“Rally Point”: The perk has been reworked.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation 5 owners who have already completed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> report a surprising inclusion within the Sony-published game's credits: Nintendo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, the company listed within the credits is Nintendo Pictures, the Mario maker's motion capture studio it bought and rebranded in 2022.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the first time that Nintendo Pictures has been credited as having contributed to a non-Nintendo game since it was acquired, though as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-owned-company-worked-on-death-stranding-2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a> reports, there may be a good reason why.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Death Stranding 2 development was underway in 2022, around the time Nintendo snapped up the company, previously known as Dynamo Pictures. Indeed, the game's reveal trailer, shown at The Game Awards 2022, features a first look at scenes with Norman Reedus and Lea Seydoux that look to have been shot using motion capture.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems probable, then, that Nintendo Pictures (or rather, Dynamo Pictures) was simply signed onto the project before Nintendo's purchase, and continued work on it per its contract. The company previously worked on the original Death Stranding, so it seems likely its services were retained relatively early.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Pictures staff members who worked on Death Stranding 2 include a motion capture director, numerous motion capture editors, motion capture coordinators, and a motion capture advisor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the acquisition, Nintendo Pictures has otherwise focused entirely on projects from its namesake, including Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Pikmin 4, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Whether the company will work on any other non-Nintendo projects now remains to be seen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting started with Death Stranding 2?
