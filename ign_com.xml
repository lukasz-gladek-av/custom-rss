            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here's what's up and down this week (October 10).</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-where-to-buy-2025">Mega Evolution</a> has kicked off with a bang thanks to its base set releasing in the US recently, and it's single card market is doing some strange things right now. One things for sure, the majority of the top chase cards in this set are getting more affordable by the day. It seems that day one stock is getting better across the board, with The Pokémon Company seemingly printing newer sets into oblivion. The long term effects remain to be seen, but more cards being printed means less damage to your pocket.</p><p id="mega-evolution-crashers-and-climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Evolution Crashers and Climbers">TL:DR; Mega Evolution Crashers and Climbers This Week</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gold Hyper Rare cards are the highest value cards in this set, with Mega Gardevoir ex (187/132) doubling in price compared to market value and Mega Lucario ex (188/132) kicking off high and currently settling at an insane $650 for the time being. There's some supprising Illustration Rare price rises in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-cards-most-expensive-cards">Mega Evolution</a> too, with Helioptile (143/132) rising by 33.6% recently thanks to it's gorgeous artwork. <br>One thing is clear with Mega Evolution, Pokémon trainers and collectors aren't giving in to FOMO. Being able to wait for sealed product and chase cards vs. buying it straight at launch can be a money burner, and it looks like this sentiment is finally sinking in at this point in Pokémania 2025. Let's get into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/feature-image-37-1760099343193.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/ao65eY?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Lucario ex – 188/132</a> is currently going for $650 near mint, which is nearly $70 below it's current market value of $719.37. Whilst it's only a 9.7% drop, it's still a great saving right now and a sign that Gold Hyper Rare cards may settle at or below $600 mark throughout the Mega Evolution era of Pokémon TCG. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Brave is a heaby hitter for 270 damage, but can't be used again next turn, so that's something to pull out when you're backed into a corner or need one more knock out. I'd much rather use Mega Lucario ex for energy recycling and building out the rest of my bench whilst dealing a solid 130 damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aADVd0?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Gardevoir ex – 178/132</a> is currently the highest valued Secret Art Rare at around $313, which is lower than the current market value of $317.08. That might not sound like a big deal, but these small dips can lead to big crashers and could indicate a price correction over the coming weeks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overflowing Wishes is great for getting Psychic energy to your benched Pokémon quickly, and it's artwork is classicly gorgeous. This is 100% a Pokémon card that would look amazing slabbed or in a chase card binder for sure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6DbX2?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Latias ex – 181/132</a> is currently valued at a much more modest $168.05, which is around $11 lower than it's current market value. Again it looks like the fandom are looking towards Gold Hyper Rare cards rather than SIRs in this era, but for me the artwork on this card wins out against the Hyper Rares floating around in this set. Mega Latias' speed and strength is captured perfectly in this artwork. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's Strafe move takes this a step further by causing 40 damage and performing a switch out with a benched Pokémon, perfect for chipping away at opposing Pokémon early game, especially low HP ones. If you follow the switching strategy, Illusory Impulse discards all energy from Mega Latias and deals 300 damage when it counts. Cool or what?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWEd07?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">My boy Mega Venusaur ex (177/132)</a> is giving out crashing energy by dropping around 6.2% to $217.97, but that's still a respectable value for an SIR. However, Mega Venusair is a very playable card, with Solar Transfer allowing trainers to move around grass energy during their turn, which is a fantastic ability and works well with Meganium from the same set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jungle Dump is both a hillarious move name and a cracking move, allowing to deal 240 damage and healing 30 damage from Mega Venusaur ex. That's why I love Venusaur, it's an absolute troll and always has a long game strategy about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QrApdG?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Kangaskhan ex (182/132) SIR</a> is also begginign its decent, running in at $91.48 compared to it's current market value of $94.20. The thing is, Kangaskhan doesn't have a massive following, so naturally it's pricing is going to reflect that. It's not very playable either thanks to trainers relying on coin flips for its main offensive move, however, Run Errand allows trainers to draw two cards per turn which is a bonus.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/feature-image-35-1760099499572.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aeKpB5?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Gardevoir ex – 187/132 Hyper Gold Rare</a> is currently doubling its market value at $600, which is frankly insane. It would however line up up with the other gold hyper rare in the set which is currently going for $650, which makes more sense. It is a ridiculously rare card all things considered, so this level of pricing just weeks after release isn't that much of a suprise. Whilst it's Overflowing Wishes and Mega Symphonia moves are cool, it's value is purely based of the regal presentation and rarity of this Gold Hyper Rare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aXVdDx?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Helioptile – 143/132</a> is moving at a strong pace for an Illustration Rare. It's gorgeous artwork is the main draw here, and it's clearly warrants it's 50.6% climb to $8.90. It's a good idea to snap this one up before it gets higher, it's still a great price for an in-demand Illustration Rare. It's not got the best moved for a basic Pokémon, so this price hike is all about looks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QbMnne?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Lucario ex (179/132) SIR</a> is my top chase card of Mega Evolution just because it features Mega Lucario and Mega Venusaur in battle, two of my favorite Pokémon. It's gone up to $330, which is a rise of 14% from its $289.45 current market value. Something tells me i'm not the only one desperate for this chase card in my collection. Although I can't see anyone using this particular card in a deck, even though Mega Lucario's Mega Brave and Aura Jab moveset is a corker. Once again, this is all about looks, and the artwork here is spot on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z31bbq?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bulbasaur (113/132)</a> comes in it's stunning Illustration Rare format and a <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxx77m?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Evolution promo stamp alternative</a>. The stamped card can be found as a bonus in upgraded booster boxes, and is commanding around $5 more in value right now, which is just a few dollars over it's market value. It's early days for both of these cards, but given Bulbasaurs popularity and the stunning floral and trippy artwork on display here, this is 100% a card to keep an eye on and buy now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

That’s enough to make EA’s new first-person shooter the second most-played game on Valve’s platform, behind only Counter-Strike 2. Battlefield 6 is already the 14th most-played game ever on Steam, with Larian’s Baldur’s Gate 3 in its sights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, the Battlefield 6 open beta hit a peak concurrent player count of 521,079. No other Battlefield game has ever come close to these numbers on Steam before. Indeed, Battlefield 6 already has more players than EA's previous Steam record-holder, the free-to-play Apex Legends, which makes the $70 Battlefield 6's achievement all the more impressive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you’re wondering, the Call of Duty app, which encompasses all Call of Duty games, has a peak concurrent player count of 491,670 on Steam, which means Battlefield 6 is well on its way to doubling the record set by its FPS rival.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The true concurrent player count will be much higher, when you consider players on PlayStation and Xbox, but neither Sony nor Microsoft make those numbers public. (This of course also counts for Call of Duty, which historically is stronger on console than PC.)
