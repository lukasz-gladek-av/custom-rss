            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Loose lips sink voidships.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During my 30 minute interview with Saber Interactive development chief Tim Willits at gamescom 2025, he wouldn’t say much at all about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-iii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3</a>, despite my repeated efforts. I’m not surprised, really. With Games Workshop and publisher Focus Entertainment watching his every word like the Inquisition on the hunt for heresy, Willits must be careful to keep his cards close to his chest or else risk being declared a heretic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I was able to get <em>something</em> out of him on the hotly anticipated sequel, namely that Games Workshop is throwing all sorts of ideas at Saber right now, and some of them are apparently "amazing."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I began my foray into Space Marine 3 territory by asking Willits why <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive">the game was announced relatively soon after the release of Space Marine 2</a>. Willits dodged the question, saying: “It's just how we work with Focus… Again, it was massively successful for us, Space Marine 2, and Focus.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That it was indeed. Space Marine 2 may well be the most successful Warhammer 40,000 video game ever made. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-sells-7-million-in-less-than-a-year-and-you-can-see-why-space-marine-3-was-confirmed-so-soon">It sold over 7 million copies less than a year after going on sale</a>, and, by Willits’ own admission, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3">changed everything for Saber Interactive</a>. Even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-made-millions-for-games-workshop-now-its-on-the-hunt-for-the-next-big-warhammer-video-game">Games Workshop itself has talked about the money it’s made from the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 3 was inevitable, then, but questions remain. Where will Lieutenant Titus and co head next? Will we see new factions? Will Saber expand co-op beyond the three-player limit? Will there be actual meaningful PvP?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, Willits wasn’t ready to answer these types of questions, but did tease ideas are coming from Games Workshop itself — and Saber is excited by them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We're working with Games Workshop, they’re the best ever,” he said. “And there’s such a rich universe that we’re pulling stuff [from]. And they've given us some ideas that are amazing. They have given us some really cool ideas. Their brains are just like… wow. So lots of super great ideas from Games Workshop.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without spoiling the Space Marine 2 campaign, it strongly suggests a continuation of the story, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-have-a-good-idea-which-enemy-faction-theyll-fight-in-space-marine-3"><u>IGN has reported on the enemy faction we’ll probably see in Space Marine 3</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Siege Mode Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some Space Marine 2 fans were concerned about the timing of Space Marine 3's announcement, but <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/glahjvsr/space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Games Workshop has said</u></a> Space Marine 3 "is likely years away from release,” and Saber has promised to continue to support Space Marine 2 for some time to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Willits pointed to the support Saber's World War Z has enjoyed as the model it’s following for Space Marine 2. A second year of Space Marine 2 content, which Focus has discussed, is already on the way. But will Space Marine 2 get story DLC?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have some plans,” Willits teased, “but we have to work with Focus to get the right announcement. But nothing is off the table.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Space Marine 2 is set for Patch 10 in September to celebrate the game’s first anniversary. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-just-confirmed-the-new-techmarine-class-the-power-axe-a-new-chaos-v-chaos-mode-and-much-more">Check out all the details here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
