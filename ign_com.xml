            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Whose turn is it?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has been one of the breakout hits of 2025. It's also a classically styled turn-based role-playing game, taking cues from many popular series, including Final Fantasy. These two factors have both led to many questions about whether Final Fantasy might return to its own roots, and now the question's been posed to one of Final Fantasy's front-facing leads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naoki Yoshida, the director/producer of Final Fantasy 14 and producer of Final Fantasy 16, was asked in an <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with AnimeNewsNetwork</a> whether mainline Final Fantasy games could go back to being turn-based, in the wake of Clair Obscur's success.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system," said Yoshida. "That doesn't take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game's systems around it. This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel. It's not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it's going to become more action-based.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[I'm] not necessarily going to be on Final Fantasy 17, so we also don't want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like 17 or even 18," Yoshida continued. "We don't want to put them on a rail."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The answer, essentially, is still up in the air. Final Fantasy changes with each entry, after all; aside from creating new stories and casts for each mainline numbered entry, each game can range from highly iterative to full-on evolutions or change-ups. Looking at the gameplay shifts from, say, Final Fantasy 9 on through 12 and 13 emphasizes how the series often shakes things up for each successive installment.</p><div id="best-mainline-final-fantasy-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3><h3>Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida has talked about this in the past, within the context of Final Fantasy 16 opting for a very action-oriented system. That <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/final-fantasy-16-ditched-turn-based-combat-to-appeal-to-younger-generations-producer-says/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entry tried to appeal to a different crowd</a>, because of the "expected" sales and impact of a mainline Final Fantasy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've had these conversations before, around the future of Final Fantasy, and will probably have them again. After all, simply judging by the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/everything-you-need-to-know-about-final-fantasy-xv-2">development timelines</a> of the past few mainline games, it might be a bit until we start hearing about Final Fantasy 17, much less 18 or beyond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and its development team at Sandfall Interactive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sells-33-million-in-33-days-not-bad-for-a-game-some-thought-was-going-to-get-crushed-by-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">have certainly struck success</a> by honing in on their goals and passions, so <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-reveals-what-he-wanted-to-say-at-the-game-awards-2023">maybe that is the true objective to strive towards</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-producer-naoki-yoshida-says-theres-not-a-clear-cut-answer-whether-future-entries-will-be-turn-based-following-clair-obscurs-success]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A better world is possible today.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2"><u>Overwatch 2</u></a> Game Director Aaron Keller has addressed criticisms that Blizzard Entertainment ‚Äúdropped the ball‚Äù when it comes to things like story content, PvE, and animated shorts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The face of Blizzard‚Äôs popular hero shooter opened up about the team‚Äôs struggles during an interview with content creator<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20r5IX0UEnM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>Jay3</u></a> and Overwatch 2 voice actor Conor McLeod. Although the multiplayer title is largely known for its team-based gameplay, Keller recognizes that some story content will need to "come back" for Overwatch 2 to be "firing on all cylinders."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúOne of the things that we hear our players talk about a lot, you see online‚Ä¶ it feels like Overwatch has dropped the ball when it comes to story and lore,‚Äù Keller said in response to a question from McLeod. ‚ÄúYou kinda see that. We used to put a few more of the big animated shorts out than we do nowadays.‚Äù</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/gLo6fdyWhQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/gLo6fdyWhQ</a></p>‚Äî Laurence @ Drawingüíô (@volskayadottxt) <a href="https://twitter.com/volskayadottxt/status/1943491882979312119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch animated shorts are a sore spot for fans. Blizzard originally built excitement with a series of high-quality cinematics from 2016 to 2023, with each highlighting abilities for characters like Reinhardt, Hanzo, Genji, Mei, Bastion, and more while also showing how many of its 43 playable characters fit into the larger story. What began as somewhat frequent lore drops eventually started to fizzle out around the release of Overwatch 2 in 2022. It‚Äôs been nearly two years since fans received a 3D-animated cinematic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Frustrations with the lack of animated shorts reached a boiling point when Blizzard announced it would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-pve-hero-mode-canceled-a-difficult-choice"><u>scrapping its PvE Hero ambitions in summer 2023</u></a>. With a long-promised story-driven mode canceled and animated short releases crawling to a halt, Blizzard had to start from scratch. Although it‚Äôs been years without a significant update, Keller says the Overwatch 2 team hasn‚Äôt completely left story behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúTo speak frankly about it, we did have a big plan to go after story in the game. That was the PvE side of it with the campaign and everything like that,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThat didn‚Äôt work out. So, it was kind of a bit of a reset moment for us when that happened, and we would like to get back to it. I think one of the best parts of Overwatch is the universe and the characters that are there. That‚Äôs definitely a goal of ours to get back to it. There‚Äôs been a bit of a step backwards that we had to take in order for us to be able to start moving forward on it again.‚Äù</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I think for us to say that Overwatch 2 is firing on all cylinders, we need to have some of that come back.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard announced a gameplay facelift for Overwatch 2 in February of this year. During its breakdown, the studio announced a major new PvP game mode called Stadium as well as the return of free loot box cosmetic rewards, two new Heroes, and a gameplan for the next year of content. Many of these additions, including a fundamental gameplay change called Perks, have launched since, signaling that Blizzard has found its footing as it makes good on significant promises.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of these changes have been accepted with open arms by the Overwatch 2 community, but as new players flock to see why fans are suddenly talking about the 2016 hero shooter again, the desire for story content still echoes across Reddit threads and X/Twitter posts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One idea many fans ‚Äì including McLeod ‚Äì would love to see is an Overwatch TV series. Keller says he‚Äôs not opposed to the idea, going as far as to say ‚Äúwe‚Äôd love to do that.‚Äù It‚Äôs unclear how, when, or if Keller and the Overwatch 2 team will be able to enter another golden age. One thing is clear: Keller knows Overwatch fans want more story content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúI think for us to say that Overwatch 2 is firing on all cylinders, we need to have some of that come back,‚Äù Keller said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch 2 is currently in the midst of Season 17: Powered Up, which features a selection of retro-gaming-inspired skins, Mythic cosmetics for Reaper and D.Va, new Stadium Heroes, and crossover content with G.I. Joe.
