I wouldn't necessarily say I'm fanatical about it, though.

I <em>do</em> really like the look of this Battle for Middle-Earth Chess set, however. I've seen a lot of really <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-chess-sets">cool chess sets</a> in my day, but this one appears to be surprisingly well done for how affordable it is. I don't even play that much chess and I've found myself adding it to my Christmas wishlist this year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Lord of The Rings Chess Set: Battle for Middle-Earth</h2><div catalogid="6975b578-071f-48b6-80c8-76451dd7ba35" id="233400"><div id="233400" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of The Rings Chess Set: Battle for Middle-Earth</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Made by The Noble Collection.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This chess set is made by The Noble Collection, which I do actually have some experience with already.

The Noble Collection is generally known for making high quality products at affordable prices, including <a href="https://www.noblecollection.com/ItemSearch--search-Chess-Sets--srcin-1?" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a variety of chess sets</a> like this one.

            <guid>1374985</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield Studios has published the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> update 1.1.3.0 patch notes ahead of next week’s Winter Offensive update, revealing a detailed list of audio improvements, soldier visibility tweaks, a range of map adjustments, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch notes for the third major Season 1 update were published in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-game-update-1-1-3-0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post</u></a> on the EA shooter series’ website today. The full breakdown follows up on promises made by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-outline-upcoming-audio-fixes-and-multiplayer-mode-adjustments-ahead-of-update-1130"><u>BF Studios’ outline from earlier this week</u></a> and touches on every notable change coming to Battlefield 6 and REDSEC when Winter Offensive reaches its December 9 release date.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though today’s patch notes cover everything from audio to Sector sizes, players may be happy to see the studio continuing to adjust an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-outline-upcoming-aim-assist-and-weapon-bloom-adjustments-for-what-could-be-the-biggest-update-yet">issue that has wormed its way to the front of online discussion</a> since launch: hit registration. BF Studios says the 1.1.3.0 changes should result in more predictable bullet impact and easier-to-read damage feedback thanks to tweaks to quick aim, pre-zoom firing, and close-quarters gunfights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other elements the Battlefield 6 developers took aim at with the Winter Offensive update include better weapon handling, improved character highlights and animations for visibility, gadget reliability, and refined gameplay for vehicle-savvy players. Launch players will also notice relatively extensive changes to Sectors and vehicles across seven Breakthrough maps: Manhattan Bridge, Mirak Valley, New Sobek City, Operation Firestorm, Liberation Peak, Siege of Cairo, and Empire State.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be some time before players get a handle on whether many of these changes correct the balance of the average Battlefield 6 multiplayer match. Those audio tweaks, however, will likely be noticeable from the get-go, with the hope being that infantry noise is clearer and easier to read at different distances.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve also continued addressing performance and memory issues that could cause sounds, such as footsteps or vehicle audio, to drop out or fail to play, especially during large-scale Battle Royale matches,” BF Studios says in the update 1.1.3.0 patch notes. “To get ahead of this as we add more audio content to the game, we’ve adjusted the memory priorities for most sounds in the game and optimized how some larger audio assets load. In practical terms, this means that important combat, movement, and vehicle sounds should play more consistently even under heavy load.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These changes are part of an ongoing effort to improve the overall stability of the soundscape. While this isn’t a complete overhaul, and there may still be edge cases depending on hardware and match conditions, it's a big step toward more reliable and predictable sound across the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each change arrives in addition to new weapons, limited-time winter events, and more new content that players have been told to expect since launch. Highlights include the Ice Lock Empire State map, the Ice Lock multiplayer and Gauntlet modes, the Ice Climbing Axe melee weapon, Portal updates, and a mini–Winter Offensive-themed battle pass bonus path. It’s the latest in the run of Battlefield 6 Season 1 chapter updates, which saw Rogue Ops bring Blackwell Fields and battle royale to the experience October 28, while California Resistance added Eastwood November 18.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Plans for Season 2 remain under wraps for now. In the meantime, you can read up on another recent change that saw BF Studios unveil <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-quickly-fixes-defibrillators-after-support-players-report-strict-revive-requirements"><u>another round of challenge and progression tweaks</u></a>.

This update also includes several quality-of-life improvements across UI, HUD, and controller aiming options, along with map-specific updates designed to stabilise objective play and reduce round-end matchmaking frustration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also made improvements to reduce cases where player settings could be reset when updating the game to the newest version. While this behaviour should now occur less frequently, we are still seeing isolated instances and expect to fully resolve the issue in an upcoming update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As always, thank you for continuing to share your feedback which helps us refine and evolve the Battlefield 6 experience.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>New Content: Winter Offensive</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>New Time-Limited Map:</strong> Ice Lock Empire State<strong>.</strong> A winter-shrouded version of Empire State featuring frozen streets and seasonal environmental visuals.</li><li><strong>New Time-Limited Multiplayer and Gauntlet Mode:</strong> A themed event mode playable across Domination, Conquest, and Gauntlet mission variations on Ice Lock Empire State featuring the event-limited “Freeze” mechanic.</li><li><strong>New Melee Weapon:</strong> the Ice Climbing Axe<strong>.</strong> Unlocked through the Winter Offensive Bonus Path.</li><li><strong>Portal updates:</strong> Ice Lock Empire State is available for use in supported Portal experiences during the event window.</li><li><strong>Battle Pass:</strong> Winter Offensive Bonus Path: an 11-tier, time-limited reward track featuring event cosmetics, XP Boosters, and the Ice Climbing Axe.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Major Updates for 1.1.3.0</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Improved hit registration across situations that previously felt unreliable</strong>, including quick aim adjustments, firing before a zoom completes, and close-quarters fights with many players.
