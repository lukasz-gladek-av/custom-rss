Taking place in the space-themed space around Magic's Multiverse, it plays on sci-fi tropes from alien creatures to uncharted planets - both of which we got to show off in the gallery above.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Preorder MTG: Edge of Eternities Cards</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first two cards - Broodguard Elite and Debris Field Crusher - are uncommon cards in the card pool of the main set. That means they generally have an eye more toward fitting into Edge of Eternities' draft and sealed formats (which only use cards from this single set) rather than making waves in constructed formats like Standard or Commander.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, they do a good job of showing off two of EOE's new mechanics: Warp and Spacecrafts. Warp is sort of an interesting twist on a previous Magic mechanic called Evoke, letting you cast creatures for a cheaper cost but forcing them to be exiled at the end of the turn, allowing you to temporarily take advantage of their abiltiies earlier and then cast them again from exile later. Spacecrafts, on the other hand, start as a simple artifact that you need to "Station" creatures on (by tapping them) in order to make them because creatures that can attack and block on their own.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other seven cards we got to reveal are a little bit different. They are all reprints of exisiting land cards with flashy new intergalactic art, and aren't actually part of the main EOE set. Instead, these are part of the Stellar Sights bonus sheet, which means these cards can be found alongside many other lands in any type of booster pack but <em>are not </em>being added to any formats they aren't already a part of. They can also be found in an even rarer "poster" variant with different art, but only in Collector Boosters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to know more about Magic's interstellar escapades, we've got a more in-depth <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-preview">preview of Edge of Eternities</a> - or if you'd prefer to stick to crossover sets, here's a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-lair-release-full-release-schedule-2025">the current schedule for its Secret Lair sets</a>.

From big hits like Balatro to collections of classic games and even a pair of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles titles, there’s something for just about everyone. Here’s the full list:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save on Nintendo Switch Games for Prime Day</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get started, it’s worth mentioning that everything on this list is playable on the Switch 2 thanks to backward compatibility. Though none have received free upgrades like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-games-free-switch-2-upgrade">some of Nintendo’s first-party games</a>, there may be performance bumps just by virtue of the increased power.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In any case, the big bargain here is likely to be the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-for-switch-hits-a-new-all-time-low-price-for-prime-day">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1</a>, which is reduced by more than half of its MSRP down to just $16.99. Considering that includes classics like the first three Metal Gear Solid titles, you’re paying just a few dollars per game. We reckon that’s a deal Big Boss would approve of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sticking with other collections and remasters, the legendary <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeboOw?object_uuid=380fdbd5-f5ee-4d3a-82ae-bdd8f3d19244&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Suikoden and Suikoden II’s HD remasters</u></a> are available for just $29.99, with a discount of 40%, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKgEPB?object_uuid=380fdbd5-f5ee-4d3a-82ae-bdd8f3d19244&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</u></a> is down to $34.99 after a 42% price cut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More JRPGs?

In fact, this superlative 3D platformer has only improved on Nintendo’s latest hardware with a higher resolution and better frame rate, which make it a game you're likely to keep coming back to (seriously, if you've not played it, now is the time).</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Nintendo eShop Summer Sale Ends Tonight</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not pressed about having a physical copy of your games, it's definitely worth checking out ongoing deals on the Nintendo eShop.
