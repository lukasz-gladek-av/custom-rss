            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-has-recouped-most-of-the-development-and-marketing-expenses-for-alan-wake-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">And Annapurna Pictures is financing 50% of the cost of Control 2.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Alan Wake 2 continues to be a success for Remedy, with the company reporting today it has recouped "most" of the development and marketing cost of Alan Wake 2 as of the end of September.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its quarterly earnings today, Remedy reported that while the game is not yet generating royalties, it's close to fully recouping costs thanks to continued strong sales. The studio has released two expansions for Alan Wake 2 this year that have likely helped - <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-2-night-springs-expansion-announced-releasing-tomorrow-sgf-2024">Night Springs</a> and, more recently, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/alan-wake-ii-lake-house-expansion-reveal-trailer-state-of-play-2024">The Lake House</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alan Wake 2 shifting to generating royalties seems inevitable, and will likely be a big deal for Remedy. It's the company's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-2-remedys-fastest-selling-game-so-far">fastest-selling game so far</a>, selling 1.3 million copies as of March 20 this year. Currently, the company's only major sources of ongoing revenue are sales of Control and older Alan Wake games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, it's getting infusions of cash from partner companies for the purpose of developing more games. For instance, Annapurna Pictures <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-movies-on-the-way-thanks-to-new-annapurna-partnership">recently entered into a partnership</a> with the studio that will fund 50% of the development of Control 2, while Annapurna creates film and TV spin-offs of Control and Alan Wake. Remedy reports that Control 2 development is on track to start full production in 2025, with a number of critical features already implemented.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Remedy's other games in progress, Codename Condor, Remedy's multiplayer Control spin-off, was announced recently as FBC: Firebreak. Remedy reports that Firebreak is still in full production, and focused on iterating on the core loop and implementing UI for player clarity based on playtesting feedback. Meanwhile, Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remake is making "steady progress" in full production.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Alan Wake 2: Night Springs DLC Reveal Trailer Screenshots - Summer Game Fest 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For the quarter, Remedy reported revenue up 128.6% year-over-year to €17.9 million ($19.4 million), largely due to the one-time payment from Annapurna Pictures to develop Control, as well as other development fees taken from other sources.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alan Wake 2 itself seems excellent, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-review">netting a 9/10 from our reviewer</a> who called it "a superb survival horror sequel that makes the cult-classic original seem like little more than a rough first draft by comparison." Its most recent DLC, The Lake House, is also excellent, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-2-dlc-has-what-looks-like-a-pretty-big-teaser-for-control-2">appears to be teasing Control 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-showa-american-story-gets-dramatic-new-trailer-release-window<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been close to three years since the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/showa-american-story-wild-sexy-chinese-depiction-america-showa-66-interview">January 2022 reveal of Showa American Story</a>, whose B-movie style trailer depicting 1980s America as a colony of Japan became a viral hit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Updates have been few and far between since then, but IGN can now exclusively reveal a new trailer along with a 2025 release window on PlayStation 5 and PC (Steam). The game genre is described as an “end of the century romantic RPG fantasy ensemble period drama”.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The dramatic trailer introduces new boss character named Shogun, a tough-looking villain who holds a shield like Captain America, a fluttering cape, and floats like Superman against the sunset. Elsewhere in the video, we see Shogun riding on the back of a pitch-black giraffe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative Director XY.Luo told IGN, “Shogun is a boss character who stands 6 meters tall. He uses the giraffe’s long neck to strike, and he can also fly, throwing his shield to attack the player.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luo explained that the battle against such an oversized enemy who rides on the back of an even taller beast will create an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for">epic scale reminiscent of Monster Hunter</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/31/shogun-1730411017501.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Meet Shogun, one of Showa American Story's major villains. Image source: Showa American Story. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Showa American Story is a road movie-style action RPG in which you cross America in a camper van and motorcycle, and the trailer shows a wealth of locations to visit. We see San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge decorated with Japanese lanterns, Las Vegas awash with neon signs in kanji, the Hollywood sign replaced with “Neo Yokohama”, and the newly christened Neo Tokyo-4 (Austin, Texas) awash with cherry blossoms. A man commits seppuku before Mount Rushmore. America is irresistibly dyed in the colors of Japan’s Showa era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Protagonist Chouko Chigusa fights her way across America, fighting zombies and strange humanoid creatures with a variety of brutal combat options. In addition to her primary weapons of swords and guns, we see Chouko fight with a giant drill. Luo told us that Chouko’s arsenal will grow throughout her adventure, with a wide variety available. The trailer also shows a wealth of customization elements and minigames inside the camper van. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Showa American Story - Exclusive Art and Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The story is still shrouded in mystery, but there’s no doubt it has a strong cast of characters. In August, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-meet-showa-american-storys-new-boss-character-texan-samurai-cowboy-gokou"><u>IGN exclusively revealed boss character Gokou</u></a>, the Texan governor turned cowboy-samurai who sold his state to Japan. And with the new trailer showing Chouko Chigusa stomping on enemies with her high heels and putting zombie heads with a golf club, our interest is piqued for further updates as Showa American Story’s 2025 release approaches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/NoMoreDaniels" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Daniel Robson</em></u></a><em> is Chief Editor of IGN Japan, and </em><a href="https://x.com/rined1987" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Esra Krabbe</u></a><em> is a member of the editorial team.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It sits one spot ahead of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which continues to enjoy ongoing success thanks to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-download-more-than-50-million-mods-including-10000-that-rename-withers-bone-daddy">introduction of mods</a> and other new features. EA previous high watermark was Jedi Survivor, which managed an all-time peak of 67,855.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA CEO Andrew Wilson predicted success for Dragon Age during Tuesday's earnings call, saying that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-boss-says-bioware-has-returned-to-its-strengths-with-dragon-age-predicts-breakout-potential-thanks-in-part-to-limited-competition">BioWare had "returned to its strengths,"</a> and that it would be benefit from limited competition thanks to Ubisoft's decision to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">delay Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We wrote in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">our own review</a>, "Dragon Age: The Veilguard refreshes and reinvigorates a storied series that stumbled through its middle years, and leaves no doubt that it deserves its place in the RPG pantheon. The next Mass Effect is going to have a very tough act to follow, which is not something I ever imagined I'd be saying before I got swept away on this adventure."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN BioWare Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall it's a solid start for BioWare's new RPG given that it launched on a day when most of its fans are either at work or in school. It'll be worth keeping an eye on its performance heading into its first full weekend as players properly dig into the first new Dragon Age release since 2014.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dragon-age-the-veilguard/Major_Choices_and_Consequences">guide to Dragon Age: The Veilguard's major choices and consequences</a> as well as our romance guide. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.
