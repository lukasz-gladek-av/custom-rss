Eagle-eyed fans have spotted hints to the story's content within the base game, though publisher Konami has so far kept schtum on the DLC actually existing.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Silent Hill 2 Remake Vs Original Comparison</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To date, Silent Hill 2 Remake remains a PlayStation console exclusive. So far, there's been no word of when it might launch on other platforms, such as Xbox Series X/S or even Nintendo Switch 2. Here's hoping we hear more soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review">Silent Hill 2 Remake review</a> returned an 8/10 score, and dubbed it "a welcome modernisation of a survival horror masterpiece. It smoothly polishes down the rough edges of the original game’s combat while taking a piece of heavy grit sandpaper to scuff up every rust and mold-covered surface of its nightmarish environments, successfully making them appear far more abrasive and menacing to explore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
