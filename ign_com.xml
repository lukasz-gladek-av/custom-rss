            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/why-bethesda-cut-gore-and-dismemberment-from-starfield<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda originally planned to include gore and dismemberment mechanics in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> but had to remove them due to technical limitations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Former employee Dennis Mejillones, who was a character artist on The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim, Fallout 4, and Starfield, told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebSmOGZnmeM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kiwi Talkz</a> that Bethesda had to cut the feature because the interaction with space suits became too complex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There was a lot of implications with the different suits from a technical perspective," he said. "There's a lot that has to go with it. You have to cut the helmet in a certain way and it's got to come off, you have meat caps to the bottom where the flesh is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We had systems for all of that and it turned into a big rat's nest. All these things you have to count for now with all these crazy hoses on the helmets and all that kind of stuff that we added. Or now you could change the body size significantly. The character creator had evolved quite a bit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans lamented that Starfield, which was the first full single-player role-playing game from Bethesda in eight years, didn't have the gore and dismemberment mechanics that were present in Fallout 4. Mejillones said these mechanics make more sense in Fallout than in Starfield, however, given their "tongue in cheek" humor. "It's part of the fun," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield arrived in September 2023 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-hits-15-million-players-as-patch-adds-achievement-friendly-creations-new-land-vehicle-and-quest-and-more">in the time since has reached more than 15 million players</a>. "Starfield has a lot of forces working against it, but eventually the allure of its expansive roleplaying quests and respectable combat make its gravitational pull difficult to resist," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-review">IGN said in our 7/10 review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, another former Bethesda developer revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-starfield-dev-surprised-by-how-much-loading-the-game-launched-with">his surprise at the sheer amount of loading Starfield ended up launching with</a>, particularly in the city of Neon. Since launch, Bethesda has worked to improve the game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-gets-big-update-that-adds-detailed-surface-maps-ship-decoration-and-60fps-on-xbox-series-x">with 60fps now possible as part of performance mode</a>. Expansion <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield-shattered-space">Shattered Space</a> launched in September.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

But one high-schooler has managed to port Doom into an actual PDF file that you can run inside your browser. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sure, it’s missing minor elements like “text” and “sound” — but who really needs that when you can play E1M1 while pretending to do those taxes you’ve been ignoring?  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Github user and “high school student” <a href="https://github.com/ading2210" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ading2210</u></a> was inspired by a recent port of Tetris, named TetrisPDF, to the humble PDF format, and resolved to make one of the world’s most celebrated shooters playable in a Chromium-based browser near you. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/14/screenshot-2025-01-14-171016-1736874646161.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Doom in a PDF?

While the official specifications for a PDF allow for more sophisticated scripting, security concerns in browsers cut things down a bit. But it was enough to still port Doom over to the format.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Javascript capabilities within the PDF specifications allowed ading2210 to “do whatever computation we want,” and the results are glorious. Using a six-color ASCII grid to represent sprites and graphics, the high-schooler managed to deliver a legible port of Doom, so long as you’re happy with a lengthy response time of 80ms per frame drawn on screen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might not want to throw out your PS5 just yet, but seeing Doom ported to the inside of a .PDF file is pretty remarkable, especially considering just how legible the overall result is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TetrisPDF creator Thomas Rinsma <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42680801" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted on Hacker News</u></a> that he had also made his own version of PDF Doom, but added that ading2210’s version was “neater in many ways."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you might not want this version of Doom to be the way you first experience the game, the novelty of seeing Doom run on all kinds of ridiculous devices, files (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DnoOOgYxck" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>or even living gut bacteria</u></a>) is endlessly entertaining.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-film-adaptation-is-about-teens-stuck-in-a-time-loop-where-every-cycle-is-a-new-horror-genre<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Until Dawn fans have received their first look at the incoming film adaptation and its wildly different premise, alongside confirmation that a full trailer is "coming soon."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony Pictures released the "Film First Look," below, which offers a few glimpses of horror action alongside commentary from Until Dawn's creators. Director David F. Sandberg also explained the premise: teenagers are stuck in a time loop where each cycle is a different horror genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The movie, it has sort of the same tone and the same vibe but it expands upon the universe," he said. "One of the creative things the game did is that people make different choices and die in different ways. The movie has this mechanic where things start over and they get to try again. Every time they come back to life it's like they're in a new horror genre. To survive, they have to make it until dawn."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-film-adaptation-features-a-new-story-and-cast-of-characters">Sony Pictures already revealed the film will feature a new story and cast of characters</a>, it's now clear it's taking a more meta approach rather than just telling a traditional horror story as the video game did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until Dawn, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-review">which arrived in 2015 and became a quick fan favorite</a>, lets players make pivotal decisions in a story where all eight teens can die, all eight can live, or anywhere in between. Its story also brought in elements of different horror genres, with villains shifting from a creepy man in the woods to a clown mask-wearing killer to full on spooky monsters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Until Dawn film will seemingly focus on these elements instead of expanding the stories of Sam, Josh, and so on, or telling the tale of new teenagers struggling through a similar night. The characters in the film will have to make different decisions, like the players of the game, and progress through different genres as they go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Actor Peter Stormare, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-film-adaptation-will-see-dr-hills-video-game-actor-reprise-his-role">who played Doctor Hill in the original game</a>, and as we now know, another character also called Hill in the film, said earlier in January that this approach works for dedicated fans and newcomers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
