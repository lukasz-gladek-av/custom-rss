This set Metal Gear Solid fans on the hunt for the true voice actress, with many suspecting Benson, given the similar sound to Ariel, but the mystery has now, finally, been solved.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The various projects that I am affiliated with in my career are sort of family-based, children-based.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Benson explained why there was so much secrecy around her work on the military stealth action game. "The various projects that I am affiliated with in my career are sort of family-based, children-based," she said. "It was actually Kris Zimmerman Salter, our director, she kind of sat down with me and she was like, 'Maybe we need to change your name.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans can enjoy hearing Benson's voice again in the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-explains-why-theres-a-symbol-in-metal-gear-solid-3-remake">officially Metal Gear Solid Δ: Snake Eater</a>), though whether or not she'll be credited herself or as Miñet remains to be seen.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/06/gettyimages-1488498661-1730915528562.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Jodi Benson at the premiere of Disney's live-action The Little Mermaid in 2023.

Whenever it does release, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-deltas-modern-camera-made-the-game-so-easy-konami-bumped-up-the-difficulty">Beyond a new first-person perspective</a>, the game is otherwise shaping up to be an exact recreation of the original. "Metal Gear Solid Delta seems more like a very shiny HD remaster than the elegant remake it could have been," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-the-first-preview">IGN said in our preview</a>. "It’s an admittedly beautiful nostalgia trip, but almost faithful to a fault."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Frazer Harrison/WireImage.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

And so all that’s very exciting. And then in certain instances, we’re also doing animation series, or live-action films to augment that and be part of those roadmaps.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That innocuous mention of a new Virtua Fighter has already set tongues wagging within the fighting game community. Virtua Fighter hasn’t seen a mainline release in years, leaving mini-game appearances in Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s Yakuza games and the 2021 release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a> to tide fans over. IGN has asked Sega for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter, which includes characters such as Akira Yuki, Pai Chan, and Wolf Hawkfield, is on the hardcore end of the fighting game spectrum, with slower-paced gameplay that challenges players to master its mechanics in order to enjoy success. Virtua Fighter 5, which first released in 2006, is considered one of the greatest fighting games of all time. Could Sega now be ready to release Virtua Fighter 6, nearly 20 years later?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During The Game Awards 2023, Sega announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-golden-axe-and-more-are-in-development-game-awards-2023"><u>new games in the Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi franchises</u></a> alongside the teaser trailer, below. The video shows brief clips of each of the games set to return.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has said its Crazy Taxi reboot, for example, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crazy-taxi-reboot-an-open-world-massively-multiplayer-aaa-game-sega-says">is an open-world, massively multiplayer AAA game</a>. There is no release date yet for the Crazy Taxi reboot or any of the other new games announced at last year's Game Awards. Perhaps we’ll find out more in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
