            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Can we have a little bit of silly, stupid fun for a second?"</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Surgent Studios, the developer behind Tales of Kenzara: ZAU, has unveiled its next game today, and it's...absolutely nothing like Tales of Kenzara: ZAU. It's called FixForce, and it's a chaotic cooperative "extraction platformer" about a team of robots fixing machines using random parts they find lying around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FixForce puts up to six players together as a robot repair crew sent into an area to fix various broken structures littered around the area within an allotted amount of time. Each broken machine indicates what parts are needed to fix it, and those parts can be found scattered around the level.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, many of those pieces will be stuck behind obstacles: bodies of water robots can't swim through, up tall towers, guarded by evil enemy robots. To collect them, you'll need to use your robot building abilities to pick up and place objects strategically so you and your friends can climb across them to reach whatever it is you need. And if you're injured by an obstacle, your head will fall off, and your teammates will need to find your head and body and stack them back together to resurrect you back into the game. Teams earn points based on how many things they fix within the time limit.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">FixForce Reveal Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I got a chance to play a round of FixForce ahead of the announcement alongside the developers, and yeah, the level of silly chaos implied in the announcement trailer pretty much encapsulates it. It's easy to get distracted goofing around with all the objects in the level and building weird, random things, but FixForce also lends itself to silly emergent moments, like when one of the devs tried to toss platforms at me to save me from being stuck on an island, and instead slammed one into me and knocked me right into the water.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a surprisingly cheery and silly time for a studio that just made a game about grieving the death of a loved one. That fact is not lost on founder Abubakar Salim, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As FixForce came together, we saw the pure chaos and hilarity it was unleashing and made the decision to move quickly and publish it ourselves," he said in a statement. "Yes, FixForce is completely unlike anything we’ve ever done before, but look: we made one game about grief and another about abuse and thought, ‘can we have a little bit of silly, stupid fun for a second?’ I promise we’ll go back to dark and depressing after this.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, this isn't the same game Salim announced in 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-creator-says-its-time-for-aaa-studios-to-move-away-from-safe-bets">Project Uso</a>, nor is it the horror game announced last year to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-developer-pocketpair-moves-into-publishing-to-release-tales-of-kenzera-devs-next-game">published by Pocketpair</a>. Surgent clearly has a lot of irons in the fire here, but its eagerness to get something released quickly makes sense given the scale of its long-term ambitions and its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-team-put-on-redundancy-notice-amid-funding-struggles">financial struggles in 2024</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FixForce is dropping in early access on March 12 on PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, and its full, final release will also be on Xbox, the studio says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/from-far-cry-to-korean-witcher-why-a-former-ubisoft-exec-is-adapting-a-fantasy-franchise-the-west-has-barely-heard-of</link>
            <guid>1447270</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">After 15 years at Ubisoft working on Far Cry, Splinter Cell and Rainbow Six, veteran developer Patrik Méthé fancied doing something different — and three years later, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pubg-publisher-krafton-finally-reveals-project-windless-an-ambitious-open-world-action-rpg-from-ubisofts-former-far-cry-director-sony-state-of-play">at Sony's recent State of Play</a>, viewers were treated to exactly that: a trailer for a blockbuster open-world action RPG starring a hulking bird warrior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/project-windless-the-bird-that-drinks-tears">Project Windless</a>, a game set in the world of the popular Korean novel series The Bird That Drinks Tears — albeit a franchise that many in the West won't have heard of. Reaction to the game's big reveal trailer was positive, Méthé tells IGN, though tinged with some jokes about its main character that is, essentially, a large humanoid chicken.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But after that initial moment of surprise, well, the game and its world look intriguing. And it's protagonist is certainly unique — a quality Méthé said had been key to centering the game on this particular hero, and why he was interested in the project overall. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"What you're playing is the rise of a mythical character that you will hear about in the [The Bird That Drinks Tears] novels, but obviously he's not there anymore because it's more than 1000 years before," Méthé said, making clear that the game has been created as an entry point for the fantasy franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You're really playing the foundation of this universe," he continued. "Whether you read the novels or not won't change your immersion, your understanding of the game itself."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Windless is set to be the first project from Méthé's Krafton Montreal, a studio forged around the idea of making this game that now houses 90 people. A further 40, meanwhile, are assisting development in a studio near Seoul.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was receiving a bunch of contacts on LinkedIn and stuff, and I received one from a company called Krafton," Méthé recalls of how his involvement began, shortly after leaving Ubisoft. "I had no clue what [Krafton] was so I almost closed it, but then it was written: 'the creator of PUBG. I'm like, 'oh, okay, might be worth [taking a look]'."</p><p>"We have this incredible IP, beloved in South Korea, you have the experience doing great AAA single-player games"<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a bit of research, Méthé found an old article suggesting that Krafton had been "looking to do the Korean Witcher" — and while this description wasn't in the official pitch for the project he eventually heard, it still piqued his interest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What Krafton asked us was simple, it was: 'We have this incredible IP, beloved in South Korea, you have the experience doing great AAA single-player games. What would you do with that in order to introduce it to the Western market?' Not that we don't want to sell to [Korean fans too], but what would you do?'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"My answer was: 'if anyone answers you [on the spot] to that kind of question, you should stop the call immediately. Because to answer that alone, without thinking about it for more than a few minutes, it's a joke. This kind of project requires the expertise of many people, so if you want a serious answer and not just buzzwords — the used sales car pitch — give me the time to sync with experts and we'll get back to you with a real answer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's what Krafton allowed Méthé to do. After some initial discussion around directly adapting The Bird That Drinks Tears' first novel, Méthé realized that setting the action generations before allowed for more flexibility in crafting a more unique story suited to a video game, rather than adapting the books' stories to a different medium while  trying to hit all the same beats.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Project Windless Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"For me it's more that we have the novels, which is great for us as developers because it answers a lot of questions that often take up a lot of resource and time," Méthé says. "We have those answers already in place, and we can then easily add layers of depth into the stories and the motivation of each race."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It hasn't all been plain sailing — Méthé says he underestimated how much of a "hectic and a bumpy adventure" it was going to be, figuring out what Project Windless would be while also "building a studio, finding a place, recruiting people, trying to understand the ecosystem of the company." He continued: "We knew it would be a good challenge and it is a good challenge. So it's never boring. Let's say it like that." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, it sounds like a welcome change for Méthé after more than 15 years working on Ubisoft shooters, including Splinter Cell Conviction, Far Cry 3, Far Cry 4, Far Cry 5, Far Cry New Dawn, and Rainbow Six Extraction — all of which he served as game director for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's very refreshing," he says. "We're not a shooter at all. Sometimes as developers, because we're repeating stuff because we're say we're doing follow-ups, you find a certain pattern that works, whereas this time it's quite the opposite. We don't have a clear benchmark to follow, and we need to come up with our own vision of what we want."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, plenty about the game remains under wraps. Apart from that trailer, there's still much to learn about the game, and more work to be done to convince players that this is a franchise that can stand alongside other open-world action RPG staples. Méthé, however, believes his team is off to a good start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What I really loved, of all the comments I've seen and all the content creator reactions I've seen, most of the time it went like this: You see the start of the trailer and they're like, 'okay, interesting, interesting. Then they're like, 'what the...', and then they're like, 'I'm in,' without any hesitation. And that's gold. That's what we wanted. But it's our first communication. It's the first time people are hearing about this. There will be a bunch more down the road to clarify what the game is, how unique it is. For the time being we're just taking the time to celebrate this moment. And when the time comes, we'll be able to explain a bit more in detail."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Connecting the world through a GTX 1660.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Death Stranding 2</a> isn't even a year old, but the PC version is already on the way in just a couple of weeks. When it launched on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-review-2020">PS5</a>, it was one of the most beautiful games on the platform, and while that would usually mean it's kind of hard to run on PC, the system requirements are forgiving. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike some recent PC launches, Sony released different quality standards for its minimum and recommended system requirements, which should help pin down what to expect when you try to run the game on your PC. For instance, the minimum spec calls for either an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/29/evga-geforce-gtx-1660-super-review-and-benchmarks">Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660</a> or an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-radeon-rx-5500-xt-review">AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT,</a> which should run the game at 1080p with low settings, at 30 fps. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to max out the game, though, you're going to need a bit more hardware, but it's still pretty reasonable. The recommended spec calls for an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-review">RTX 3070</a> or a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review">Radeon RX 6800</a>, and will run the game at 1440p with the High quality preset at 60 fps. Not bad. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I went ahead and listed all of Sony's recommended PC specs below, but as long as you have a relatively modern PC, the game should be able to run flawlessly onj your machine. Nixxes, the studio handling the PC port has also added a "portable preset" which should make it run smoothly on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-handheld-gaming-pc">PC handhelds</a> like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/steam-deck">Steam Deck </a>or the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review">Xbox Ally X.</a> </p><div><div><p>Death Stranding 2 Minimum Specs</p></div><div><div><p>Graphics Card</p><p>Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT</p></div><div><p>Processor</p><p>Intel Core i3-10100 / AMD Ryzen 3 3100</p></div><div><p>Storage</p><p>150GB (SSD recommended)</p></div></div></div><div><div><p>Death Stranding 2 System Requirements (1080p60)</p></div><div><div><p>Graphics Card</p><p>Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 / AMD Radeon RX 6600</p></div><div><p>Processor</p><p>Intel Core i5-11400 / AMD Ryzen 5 5600</p></div><div><p>Storage</p><p>150GB (SSD Recommended)</p></div></div></div><div><div><p>Death Stranding 2 System Requirements (1440p60)</p></div><div><div><p>Graphics Card</p><p>Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 / AMD Radeon RX 6800</p></div><div><p>Processor</p><p>Intel Core i7-11700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5700X</p></div><div><p>Storage</p><p>150GB (SSD Recommended)</p></div></div></div><div><div><p>Death Stranding 2 Recommended Specs (4K60)</p></div><div><div><p>Graphics Card</p><p>Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 / AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT</p></div><div><p>Processor</p><p>Intel Core i7-11700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5700X</p></div><div><p>Storage</p><p>150GB (SSD Recommended)</p></div></div></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Humble Requirements</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even at the high end, Death Stranding 2's system requirements are pretty humble by today's standards. While the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-16gb-founders-edition-review">GeForce RTX 4080 </a>seems like a lot, keep in mind that this is likely for maxing out the game at 4K, which you very much don't need to do. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keep in mind that the minimum spec is calling for a GTX 1660, which was a low-end card when it came out in 2019, and that was almost seven years ago now. I won't know exactly how this game performs until I'm able to run it on my own hardware, but the wide range of GPUs being represented here likely means that the game is incredibly scalable. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Death Stranding 2: 45 Amazing Details That Blew Us Away</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also important to note that even on the PS5 Pro, Death Stranding 2 did not use ray tracing, which means the higher graphics settings are going to be a lot more approachable than other recent AAA games – unless, of course, ray tracing is added to the PC version. Luckily, Nixxes is also adding support for DLSS, XeSS, FSR and Guerilla's Pico upscaler, so you should be able to find some way to boost your performance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Death Stranding 2 launches on PC March 19th, so at least we won't have to wait too long to see how it performs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.

Sadly, the Collector Booster is the real value proposition here, because they’re like gold dust.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collector Boosters include cards that are functionally the same as the cards you’d get from a Play Booster pack, but since they feature foils and alternative art treatments, they’re where you’re much, much more likely to find pricier cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The product listing suggests players use the Collector Booster as a prize for whoever wins Draft Night, but I can see scalpers pulling it out and selling it on to make money on the secondary market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also in stock, however, is the new <a href="https://zdcs.link/QG8ppJ?object_uuid=e22d702d-1344-44b9-9d93-9b61c2a734bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Turtle Team-Up</u></a>.
