It’s just won two <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bafta-games-awards-2025-the-full-list-of-winners">BAFTA Game Awards</a>: one for Best Multiplayer, another for Best Music. That’s from five nominations. The BAFTA wins bring to an end a fruitful video game awards season, drawing a line under what has been a remarkable year for Swedish developer Arrowhead.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Helldivers 2 accepts the win for Multiplayer at the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BAFTAGamesAwards?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BAFTAGamesAwards</a> ✨ <a href="https://t.co/rYWwyc1KGR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/rYWwyc1KGR</a></p>— BAFTA Games (@BAFTAGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/BAFTAGames/status/1909690279919071465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s remember, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks">Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time</a>, with an astonishing 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks. It is a record no first-party Sony-developed game will likely ever beat. But so much has happened since that initial explosive release: a dramatic U-turn on PSN account requirements on Steam, review-bomb campaigns, and a community often at war with Helldivers 2 itself as nerfs and buffs either went too far or not far enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through it all, Arrowhead has struggled to cope with a bigger, more mainstream playerbase than it’s ever had to contend with. But now, 14 months after Helldivers 2 hit PC and PlayStation 5, how does Arrowhead reflect on what’s gone before? Has it finally started to get to grips with the brutal, unforgiving world of live-service? And after that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-gives-all-players-next-weeks-killzone-items-for-free-following-pricing-backlash-and-theyre-available-now">Killzone collaboration</a>, could Warhammer 40,000 be next?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN sat down with Alex Bolle, production director on Helldivers 2, to find out more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Congratulations on all the awards! When you were in the thick of development and things weren't perhaps going as well as they might have otherwise been, did you ever imagine that a year after the game came out it would be considered one of the best games of 2024 and win all these awards?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> No, no, definitely not. It's a very humbling experience. I would say a year ago exactly, we had a hint that it would be a sweet year for us, but we were also in the thick of it. We were still fixing a lot of things, preparing our next big release for the content. So no, definitely not realizing we would get there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last time we spoke, we were preparing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-adds-new-faction-illuminate-in-omens-of-tyranny-update-and-its-out-now-the-game-awards-2024">Omens of Tyranny</a>. Even then we are like, okay, we have The Game Awards. We were preparing the whole shadow drop and everything. We were ready to make that shadow drop and be like, okay, this one is going to be fun. The awards part, maybe not that much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was next to my release manager trying to monitor the progress of Omens of Tyranny and the whole major order with the Illuminate. And I turned my head towards the TV at the office, it was like 2am. And I see Mikael Eriksson, the game director, just shaking hands with Snoop Dogg. And I'm like, what is going on here? Which reality are we?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yeah, it's been good. The Golden Joysticks, DICE, all those awards, it's a good way to take a step back and look at the impact of the game. We’re nearing the end of the awards season and this one feels really good, because the credibility and the fame of it is just amazing. So yeah, it's great. It's going to be a good addition for the team, I hope.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> It's been over a year since the game came out, so people have had time now to reflect upon its release and its impact. Have you come to understand why it's won so many awards, why it's done so well? Why it's resonated so much with gamers? Have you worked out why Helldivers 2 has ended up being the success it has been?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> I wish the interview was two hours! It's a whole soup recipe, or maybe more like a very sophisticated French dish. I don't think we figured it out. One thing we keep at heart is just the interaction with the community. All the players, taking the time to really talk to them, understand what they want. We have so many devs that are continuously looking at Discord, at Reddit. We have a lot of things that come from there and we want to keep that interaction level.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That has been the thing that we thought, okay, when we prepare the fantasy for the next updates and so on, this is the part that we want to keep. We were talking about the future of the game with Mikael and it was all about that. What is it that the player wants? What is it that we are not achieving yet? What's next? And this is always like, players in mind. It's what works well. It's the ability to talk to them, ability to make that kind of fantasy in the game around the Galactic War.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-throwing-everything-but-the-kitchen-sink-at-one-planet-and-players-are-still-holding-out">Last week with Pöpli IX</a>, it's been a year and we still manage to get those moments in-game. I think it's important. These are needed. I was talking to our Game Master this morning, it feels good to have that. It's one of the things we'll cherish until we don't make the game, but so far it's working well.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Helldivers 2 Escalation of Freedom Update Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> You've spoken as a team before about the impact Helldivers 2 had on you as a studio, and it was a big shock to the system. Do you feel like now you're starting to get a handle on what Helldivers 2 is, what the audience is, and settling into a sustainable, healthy way of keeping it going as a live service? Especially after having that influx of players that you weren't perhaps expecting and the type of players that were different than what you were expecting? </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> We're still trying to figure out the good recipe for a healthy cadence for the developers, for the players as well. Who do we cater to as well? It's been super interesting. I've been at Arrowhead for a bit more than three years now, coming from bigger studios and yeah, there's a lot of things that we had to go back to square one, on how it works at Arrowhead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Johan Pilestedt, as one of our founders and the lead of the studio for so long, has been key in setting a development culture that we try to keep at heart while maintaining that live service aspect. This has been catching lightning in a bottle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I feel like every week is taking learnings again from the different wins and failures that we had along the way. Also from other developers. I think it's been one of the good advantages that we had, is that success also allows us to talk way more openly with all the devs. It's been very good on that side. It's sharing ways to do it, better ways, more sustainable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On who do we make the game for? That's a tricky one. Arrowhead’s motto has always been ‘a game for everyone is a game for no one.’ When you add this amount of players, no one and everyone is a bit muddy. So it's always a bit of a puzzle of like, okay, this content is for these type of players, this content is for this type of player. And this is where we are still working very hard with PlayStation, with the team internally to understand, hey, when you want to make this enemy, who do you have in mind?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think it's a very fingertip sensitivity that we are getting slowly. I think there's a lot of work within direction as well to remind us who we were making the game for at the very, very, very beginning, because we have a lot of the old guard of Arrowhead still around to help us figure this out. We have one of the features upcoming that we've been developing with one of our old-time founders for example, and it's been so good because he brings that magical angle on the co-op.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> The internet loves to talk about Steam concurrents, but I would like to get your take as someone who knows the data. Do you think Steam concurrents are misleading? Do they give some insight into the success or otherwise of a live service game? Obviously you had a huge peak, but it is unreasonable to expect that to maintain itself forever, and Helldivers 2 seems to have settled on Steam. From your perspective, how do you view that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> I am far from being the expert of the studio on this. I do see sometimes a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more you talk about it, the more you show it, the more people are like, wow, interesting, it's going up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a metric among many others. There's many reasons for a game's success or failure. I think we've been doing good numbers, like breaking some trends and everything. On our side, the only thing I can say is that, yeah, we want to keep that steady floor of players and bringing people again for new memorable moments for the game and for the community. So I would say that's pretty much where we want to go. Do we have screens all around the studio with CCU [concurrent users] and all those metrics? Of course, because it's always good to keep them in mind. But we're not obsessed by it. I think we are in a position we don't have to be, but we want to make sure, hey, when we make something, it's meaningful. That's the thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Whatever happens, you'll probably forever now be the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time. I can't see a game ever really topping that. As a studio, does that mean you can be a bit more relaxed about what you're doing with Helldivers 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> Yes and no. Yes, in a way, especially in these days for the industry, it feels like such a privileged situation. That is amazing. I think we are cherishing that a lot. At the same time, we don't want to take this for granted. There's a studio, we have developers to pay. We have a studio life to keep on for years and years and years. So that's the thing where we're like, yeah, it's been good. We need to make sure it keeps going great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also an accountability for, again, the people we make the game for. We're not going to just start to be like, okay, it's fine. It's going to be fine. We can take a bit more time. We want to take more time to make things better, especially now that the players are asking for it. But yeah, there's definitely an ambition to keep things going, keep our standards of development, keep finding creativity and innovation. If we just became complacent, I don't think Arrowhead would be Arrowhead.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Do you think it's reasonable for a game like Helldivers 2 to have a multi-year plan that envisages the game being around for a decade? For me, Helldivers 2’s gameplay feels almost timeless, so it could become a forever game. Or will there come a point where you have to think about what’s next when it comes to Helldivers itself?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> Thank you for acknowledging that the game might not age at all! I love when you boot a game after 15, 20 years and it still plays the same.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Helldivers 2 has that about it doesn’t it? It‘s about the things that happen in the game and the physics at play and the feel of it, as opposed to it being future-proofed in terms of visuals, for example.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> Absolutely. When I talk with the team, when I talk to the directors, when I talk to Mikael about the future, it’s exciting because we want it to be around for years and years and years to come. And it's almost like, how do we stay true to the Helldivers 2 fantasy, challenging enough that we keep making amazing new features and new systems and all that while we stay true to who we are? And I think it's something that is so motivating for the years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The more we figure out how to thrive in a live environment, and we still have a way to go to figure out a lot of things around that, the more we can let creativity loose on new systems that we would've never thought about a year ago when we released. I've worked on live games before and it's where you feel like you have something you can figure out: what if I would do this cool thing I've seen in other games and adapt it to our sauce, that still makes it true to ourselves? I'm looking forward to this moment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> You’ve done a Killzone collab. I'm a massive Warhammer 40,000 fan, and as soon as I started playing Helldivers 2 I thought, oh my God, if I was an Imperial Guard soldier dropping down, facing off against waves of Tyranids or Necrons… can you give me any hope as a fan of both Helldivers 2 and Warhammer 40,000 that this is even possible?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> What I can say is that we had a blast working on the collaboration with Guerrilla on Killzone. One thing that everyone agreed internally is that making something from a different game IP in our universe, this is quite fun. It has challenges because again, we are very, very cautious about our fantasy. So we want to be able to explore those possibilities. We got super excited with Killzone. We want to do more for sure. I can't tell you more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our devs are players, they play so many games. Obviously Warhammer 40,000 is something that a lot of guys internally love to death. So the devs are discussing, the devs are proposing stuff, and the hype is building. So these are discussions internally that we are having. Warhammer 40,000, I can't really tell you. Maybe. Who knows? We'll see!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
