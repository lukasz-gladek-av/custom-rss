At least some of the remaining Private Division employees are expected to be laid off in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is according to a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, which states that a currently unnamed company staffed by former Annapurna Interactive employees has reached a deal with private equity firm Haveli to take over the distribution of Private Division titles. Bloomberg reports and IGN can independently confirm that Haveli <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/private-division-sold-to-unknown-buyer">is the company that purchased Private Division from Take-Two Interactive last year for an undisclosed amount</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The portfolio includes both current and upcoming Private Division titles, such as Tales of the Shire, which releases March 25. It also includes Project Bloom, a AAA action-adventure game developed by Game Freak that was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-bloom-pokemon-game-freak-private-division">announced back in 2023</a> with nothing more than a concept art teaser.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/pd-gf-projectbloom-conceptart-3840x2160-1683657401083-1736271759393.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Concept art for Game Freak's Project Bloom, formerly published by Private Division.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Bloomberg reports, Haveli's purchase of Private Division included not just the portfolio, but 20 employees who remained with the label <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division">following Take-Two-implemented layoffs last spring</a>. Remaining employees have reportedly been told to explore other employment options, with the expectation that at least some of them will be laid off as part of the deal with the unnamed new publisher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Private Division was formerly Take-Two's publishing label, which the company founded back in 2017. It was intended to support independent games that were smaller than the fare typically supported by the Grand Theft Auto publisher. Over the years, Private Division produced titles such as The Outer Worlds, OlliOlli World, and Kerbal Space Program 2, but game sales repeatedly fell short of Take-Two expectations. Early last year, we reported that Take-Two was slowly shuttering operations at Private Division, first by winding down operations at its supported studios and then by selling off the label.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new owners of Private Division's portfolio are a group of former employees of Annapurna Interactive that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/annapurnas-entire-gaming-team-has-resigned">collectively resigned last year</a> following a leadership dispute at Annapurna. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-heck-has-been-going-on-at-annapurna-interactive-an-investigation">reported last fall on the messy circumstances</a>, which left Annapurna seeking to restaff an entire publishing team to cover its numerous obligations and roughly 25 individuals seeking new employment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
