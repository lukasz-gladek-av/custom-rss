But the one the people behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> came up may perhaps live a little longer in the memory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, Space Marine 2 publisher Focus Entertainment declared that the new Chaplain class would be released as DLC on April 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In story mode, swap out Titus for The Chaplain and experience the game as a true Codex-compliant Ultramarine,” Focus said, no doubt sniggering from behind their monitors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This ‘DLC’ supposedly added the new playable character to the story mode, as well as an ‘Enhanced Dialogue System’ that would have the Chaplain, every five minutes, remind everyone around him that “the Codex Astartes does not support this action,” and “I’m telling the Inquisition.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Chaplain even has a special ability called Discipline. This would involve instantly reporting “any and all minor deviations from the Codex Astartes for a 5% discipline bonus (but -20% brotherhood bonus).</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/02/gndip2wxsaacl76-1743582241376.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The joke here works because as anyone who played Space Marine 2’s campaign knows, Chaplain Quintus watches Titus’ every move with a hawk-like distrust for signs of heresy, despite the protagonist’s demonstrable loyalty to the Imperium, the Ultramarines, and the Emperor himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the campaign, as Titus battles against the Tyranids and the Thousand Sons traitor legion, it becomes clear there is something… special about him, and Chaplain Quintus does not like that one bit. He’s a bit like the annoying school prefect who patrols the corridors for a mere whiff of deviant behavior and then— bam! You’re reported to the headmaster. Everyone hates the Chaplain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Chaplain has become something of a meme within the Space Marine community, and it’s this status that the Space Marine 2 April Fool’s joke leans into. But some fans have said they would love for The Chaplain to actually come to the game, not, perhaps, with this exact skill set, but as a straight-up warrior-priest who insists upon the veneration of the Emperor at all times.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“This would actually go hard if this was real,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1jp0r9r/this_would_actually_go_hard_if_this_was_real/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared ResidentDrama9739 in a post on the Space Marine subreddit</a> that’s full of enthusiastic chatter about the Chaplain and how he might work in the game. Some are even saying </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing is, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-moves-to-set-the-record-straight-insists-its-not-abandoning-the-game-following-space-marine-3-announcement">Space Marine 2 <em>is </em>getting a new class soon</a>. Focus and developer Saber Interactive have yet to say what it is, but fans certainly have their theories. Most assume it will be the Apothecary, as close to a medic class as Space Marines have. But there is hope that it could be the Librarian, which would mean super cool warp-powered space magic. Does the Chaplain’s star turn in Space Marine 2’s April Fool’s Day joke rule him out?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot happening in the world of Space Marine 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive">despite the surprise announcement that development of Space Marine 3 development had begun</a>. Space Marine 2’s year one roadmap remains, and Patch 7 is set to be released mid-April. But in the coming months Space Marine 2 will also get the aforementioned new class as well as new PvE operations and melee weapons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

With 500,000 views, a court agreed that Jobst's video defamed Mitchell and included inaccurate and unsubstantiated claims.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/13/donkey-kong-champ-billy-mitchell-stripped-of-title"><u>King of Kong was initially stripped of his title</u></a> in 2018 after his scores were scrubbed from Twin Galaxies' leaderboards following claims the high score record holder had used a MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) and not arcade cabinets to secure his records in games like Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, and Donkey Kong Jr., which is strictly against the rules.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After six years of defending his records, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/billy-mitchells-donkey-kong-records-reinstated-twin-galaxies"><u>Mitchell was later able to have his accolades reinstated</u></a> as part of a "historical database" on Twin Galaxies' website, a site that tracks competitive gaming records. His high scores were also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/guinness-world-records-reinstates-billy-mitchell-records-pac-man-donkey-kong"><u>reinstated by the Guinness World of Records in 2020</u></a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/01/gettyimages-89775843-1743500522351.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Billy "King of Kong" Mitchell has won a defamation lawsuit against Australian YouTuber Karl Jobst. Photo by David Greedy/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But Mitchell's defamation lawsuit against Jobst was unrelated to the legitimacy of his Donkey Kong scores. Rather, Mitchell sued because, as he alleged, Jobst's 2021 video implied that Mitchell's prior lawsuit against another YouTuber, Benjamin "Apollo Legend" Smith, resulted in the latter having to pay out $1m in damages and contributed to Smith taking his own life in 2020. It also reportedly suggested Mitchell had "expressed joy at the thought" of Smith's suicide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jobst later edited his video after Mitchell threatened legal action, and Smith's brother confirmed no money had been paid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I lost. The judge found Billy to be a credible witness and believed his entire testimony," Jobst confirmed on <a href="https://x.com/karljobstgaming/status/1906894274752590183" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>X/Twitter</u></a>, stressing he <a href="https://x.com/karljobstgaming/status/1906936348189290503" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>did not accuse Mitchell of cheating</u></a>, and his claims about Smith were formed by "incorrect information from multiple sources."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"From that point on unfortunately there was really nothing that could have saved me. I will now obviously consider my options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I know many of you will be upset with this and I am sorry for that. Thank you again for all the support I have received and I will endeavor to work as hard as I can to repay all that you are owed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The judge ordered Jobst to pay $187,800 (AU$300,000) for damages for non-economic loss, $31,300 (AU$50,000) for aggravated damages, as well as $22,000 (AU$34,668.50) in interest, totalling around $241,000, saying: "[Mitchell] may well have been justified in being ordered to pay more than AU$50,000 in aggravated damages, but that is the amount being sought by Mr Mitchell and that is the amount I shall award." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mitchell famously achieved a perfect score in Pac-Man in the '80s, before rising to fame in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/16/the-king-of-kong-a-fistful-of-quarters-review"><u>2007 documentary, King of Kong</u></a>, which focused on the rivalry between Mitchell and Steve Wiebe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by David Greedy/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.
