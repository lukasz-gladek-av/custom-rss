            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There's less than 24 hours to go until a major Nintendo Direct, but there's something very different this time. Yes, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has finally been released — leaving fans searching for a fresh game to pin all their hopes and inevitable disappointment on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> release date seeming fairly assured, fans are suggesting some of Nintendo's second-tier series to hope for next. This includes Star Fox (missing in action since 2017's Star Fox 2), Golden Sun (sunset in 2010) and F-Zero (which has only seen the bitesize release of F-Zero 99 since 2004). And <em>what about Mother 3</em>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, tomorrow's Nintendo Direct will likely feature non-Nintendo games too. Is it time to hope for news on Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, Ubisoft's space-set sequel that now holds the Guinness World Record for the video game longest in development? You never know. (You probably do know.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This week's big Nintendo Direct airs tomorrow, Friday September 12, at 6am Pacific, 9am Eastern or 2pm UK time. It's set to be a bumper show, too, with an hour of announcements — and fan hopes of some big reveals by Nintendo are high. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond this year (and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is still slated for 2025, last we checked) we know relatively little of what Nintendo has cooking for Switch 2. There's spinoff Splatoon: Raiders and FromSoftware exclusive The Duskbloods. But beyond those, Nintendo's plans for the future remain under wraps.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Nightmare Foxy (@NightmareFoxxyy) <a href="https://twitter.com/NightmareFoxxyy/status/1963291102536245697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light">— Cibles (@CiblesGD) <a href="https://twitter.com/CiblesGD/status/1965782505212309680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The timing of a Direct tomorrow is also interesting — as many fans have pointed out — as it comes on the eve of Super Mario Bros.' 40th anniversary. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-announced-in-the-super-mario-bros-35th-anniversary-direct-super-mario-3d-all-stars-mario-64-sunshine-galaxy-3d-world">Nintendo celebrated the game's last big birthday with a series of special launches</a>, including the time-limited Super Mario 3D All-Stars Collection. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could we see something similar announced tomorrow (hopefully including Galaxy 2)? Or a glimpse of the next major 3D Mario game? Or how about some news on next year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/untitled-the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel">Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel</a>? Tune in tomorrow to find out what is there, as IGN reports live. (No one suggest Silksong 2.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, a former Nintendo employee claimed that the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-has-no-real-need-for-new-franchises-veteran-says-and-can-just-pick-whatever-existing-series-fits-new-gameplay">knew it no longer needed to create as many fresh franchises</a> — as fans were already waiting long enough for new entries in existing series, which could simply be adapted to fit new gameplay styles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
