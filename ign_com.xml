This sale ends on December 13. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate gives you access to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/game-pass-ultimate">library of hundreds of Xbox games</a>, including day one releases. If you don't own a console and don't want to pay for one, there's even a legitimate way to play Game Pass games <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-wireless-controller-deal-for-cloud-gaming-prime-day-2024">without an Xbox</a>. Although you do lose access to the library once your membership is over, all your past achievements and progress will be saved. New release games are not cheap, and being able to play them at launch without paying retail price for them will save you a lot of money. This perk alone will easily recoup the cost of the membership.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other benefits include access to Xbox Game Pass for PC, exclusive membership discounts, Xbox Cloud Gaming, a bonus EA Play subscription, extra in-game content and rewards, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
