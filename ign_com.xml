It also seems to carry some of its technical nuances, according to a new breakdown from the tech experts at Digital Foundry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-elden-ring-nightreign-offers-no-technical-progression-and-doesnt-properly-support-ps5-pro" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> published an analysis of the tech details behind FromSoftware's latest, and while Nightreign remixes a lot of what Elden Ring was into something new, it sounds like the state of Nightreign's technology is fairly reminiscent of Elden Ring's.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is really nothing new to those familiar with FromSoftware's Elden Ring engine, and how it operates on consoles," wrote Digital Foundry's Thomas Morgan.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Digital Foundry characterized the optimization for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles as "disappointing," as Nightreign continues to "often fall short of a target 60 frames per second while exploring." Additionally, the tech analyst noted there's no listed support for PlayStation 5 Pro, which bore out in tests, meaning the PS5 Pro is just running the base PS5 code with no additional modes or optimizations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I recommend visiting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-elden-ring-nightreign-offers-no-technical-progression-and-doesnt-properly-support-ps5-pro" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> for the full numbers breakdown, as there's quite a bit to go through, but all of it is best summed-up by Morgan here: "Ultimately, using the quality mode makes no practical sense on any console." The base PS5 typically hovers in a lower 30-45 frames per second range in this mode, compared to a 40-60 range on the framerate mode, and the Xbox consoles mirroring similar gaps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the PS5 Pro seems to benefit from having a little extra horsepower to run Nightreign, there are still "lurches" while exploring the world that stuck out to Digital Foundry. The article concludes by saying there's "so much left to be desired on the technical front" when it comes to Elden Ring Nightreign, as 60 frames per second performance on consoles is "all too often out of reach."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Elden Ring Nightreign news, FromSoftware has confirmed further updates in the pipeline for the co-op exprience, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-duo-expeditions-on-the-way-fromsoftware-confirms-as-sales-jump-to-35-million">including tougher versions of existing Nightlords and a Duos mode somewhere down the line</a>.

Ciri and her horse Kelpie have particularly impressive movement and interactions with each other, NPCs, and the game world as they make their way through the mountains of Kovir to the bustling port town of Valdrest. At one point in the demo, CD Projekt upped the NPC count in the market scene to 300 individually animated characters. The showcase ended with a first look at Lan Exeter, the winter capital and a major port city in Kovir.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The “standalone” tech demo was built to showcase Unreal Engine 5 features, CD Projekt said, and tools it’s using to develop the game’s open world. It is not gameplay footage, the developer stressed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, does the tech demo reflect what players can expect from The Witcher 4? CD Projekt said the visuals “reflect the direction we’re taking with The Witcher 4 — but it doesn’t fully represent the final game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt continued: “Production is still underway, and we have a great deal of work ahead. That said, our goal is ambitious: to create one of the most visually advanced role-playing games to date.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer also explained why it chose PS5 over a high-end PC for the tech demo: “Because optimizing for consoles early helps us future-proof performance across all platforms. Consoles come with tighter constraints, and meeting them pushes us to make smarter, more efficient tech choices — the kind that benefit every version of the game.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Witcher 4 Unreal Engine 5 Tech Demo Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the big questions about The Witcher 4 is target launch platforms. With this tech demo on PS5, the suggestion is it will be a cross-gen game that also runs on the next-gen consoles (PS6 and the next-gen Xbox). But if it’s due out on current-gen, does that also mean it will be available on the underpowered Xbox Series S?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembring that Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto VI is, as it stands, also due out on current-gen consoles including the Xbox Series S. So if GTA 6 is possible on Microsoft’s cheaper console, perhaps The Witcher 4 is, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-the-witcher-4-be-targeting-the-ps6-and-next-gen-xbox-given-it-wont-be-out-until-2027-at-the-earliest"><u>CD Projekt has indicated The Witcher 4 won’t be out until 2027 at the earliest</u></a>, so it may be some time before we find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
