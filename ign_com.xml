I am praying he makes to when we are done. Thanks, internet, for signal boosting Caleb’s story.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re deeply thankful to the Borderlands community for rallying around Caleb after he shared his story several weeks ago,” <a href="https://x.com/GearboxOfficial/status/1861880536467210743" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gearbox added</a>. “His courage, strength, and determination are an inspiration to us all. Our team was honored to host him last week at our studio.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McAlpine himself returned to the Borderlands 3 subreddit to post pictures of his Gearbox visit and reveal what had happened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So Gearbox flew me and a friend down 1st class the 20th of this month and we got to tour the studio and meet an amazing bunch of people from some of the devs of all of the Borderlands games up to Randy the CEO,” McAlpine posted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We got to play what they have for Borderlands 4 so far and it was amazing. I don’t know if I will be around when the game comes out but I just want to say thank you to all of you for all of your love and support and for helping in making this happen. It truly was an amazing experience and it was just awesome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We stayed at the Omni at the Star (the Dallas Cowboys headquarters) and the hotel wanted to do something nice as well and got us in on a VIP tour of the entire facility. Needless to say me being a Lions fan I got to talk a lot of smack lol.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thank you everyone.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 is due out at some point in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-sky-dev-hello-games-hails-very-positive-steam-rating-8-years-after-overwhelmingly-negative-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"You have no idea what this means to us."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man’s Sky</a> developer Hello Games has hailed hitting a ‘very positive’ Steam user review user rating for the first time, eight years after the game’s controversial launch was slammed by players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space sim No Man’s Sky launched in August 2016 on PS4 and PC to tens of thousands of negative reviews on Steam, with players complaining about broken promises and a lack of meaningful content, particularly on the multiplayer side. The game quickly settled on the dreaded ‘overwhelmingly negative’ Steam user review rating, a clear sign to anyone who visited its Steam page that something was very wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Guildford, England-based Hello Games has continued to update No Man’s Sky over the years, improving player sentiment to the point where it is now considered superb. It took two years to hit ‘mixed,’ then another three to hit ‘mostly positive.’ At the time, five years after launch, Tim Woodley, Head of Publishing at Hello Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-sky-gets-mostly-positive-steam-review-5-years">explained how hard it was to claw back Steam user reviews from such a low base</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Over the last five years we've moved from 'overwhelmingly negative' to 'mostly positive,’ it's an incredible achievement for the team,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Moving to 'mixed', which may seem funny to celebrate, took two years of hard work. Moving from ‘mixed’ to ‘mostly positive’ has taken the last three years (knowing that any small mistake along the way may result in backlash and negative reviews).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In some ways, it's easy to dismiss Steam reviews, it's a bit of meme to share the silly ones, but as a developer, they are undeniably meaningful. For five years now if someone bought No Man's Sky they had to do it in spite of a red or yellow warning symbol beside our name (and affecting the likelihood algorithm in charge of displaying the name in the first place).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The team is really chuffed today at hitting this milestone but we also owe a huge thank you to the community, the players, but also folks like yourself who continue to support us to do this work we enjoy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Each percentage point becomes exponentially harder to earn as you move up the ratings. Moving from 20% positive to 21% positive may only require a few hundred positive reviews whereas moving from 69% to 70% needed 10,000 positive reviews. This is why it's so rare for games to change their All-Time rating and why we'd assumed that we might never be able to."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, three years after that milestone, No Man’s Sky is on ‘very positive.’ Next stop, ‘overwhelmingly positive?’</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/hQcPpQ8ILM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/hQcPpQ8ILM</a> <a href="https://t.co/69AjoB48NY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/69AjoB48NY</a></p>— Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1862085950181892131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Hello Games chief Sean Murray, who had come under fire upon Hello Games’ launch for failing to deliver on features he’d talked up in pre-release interviews, hailed the game’s new Steam user review rating. “Holy shit you guys - it happened,” he tweeted. “ALL REVIEWS: Very Positive. Thank you Thank you Thank you. You have no idea what this means to us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Hello Games continues to work on No Man’s Sky, it’s developing its next game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/light-no-fire"><u>Light No Fire</u></a>. It's about adventure, building, survival and exploration together, set on a fantasy planet the size of Earth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Target is one of the most popular retailers for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-black-friday-2024-deals">Black Friday</a>, and one thing I've learned over the years of finding deals is that it knows how to put on a good sale. This year, Target has come out the gate swinging with outstanding Black Friday deals on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPbP6W?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNDPKE?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5 consoles</a>, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVDPMO?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Meta Quest 3S VR headset</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rayban-meta-wayfarer-smart-glasses-black-friday-deal-2024">Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer smart glasses</a>. It's also a great one-stop shop for holiday gift ideas like a new Apple iPad or a pair of AirPods, Pokemon TCG sets, LEGOs, toys, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Target is one of my favorite shopping sites, both in-store and online. Its prices are very competitive, its return policy is generous, and it has plenty of retail locations so that buying online and picking up in-store is a convenient option. Target offers great exclusive discounts via its <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6nPw?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target Circle membership</a>, and best of all, joining is free. There is a paid upgrade that's worth it for regular Target shoppers similar to Amazon Prime or Walmart+, and it's on sale for Black Friday as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Update: Target's most popular deals, like the Nintendo Switch bundles and Apple devices are going out of stock quickly. I expect some (but not all) of these deals to return on Black Friday, if not sooner.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Friday is like a bonus holiday for Pokémon TCG fans. We're talking about deck building, chasing rare cards, or just stockpiling boosters for a rainy day. This year’s Black Friday deals are stacked with good finds.</p><div catalogid="b7da3839-8786-4d5d-b4cf-91f633a5d7a5" id="212187"><div id="212187" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Disney and Pixar 'Up' House 43217</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGOs are one of the best gift ideas for the holidays, so LEGO deals get snapped up pretty quickly during Black Friday. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKDGpY?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target is advertising select sets for up to 40% off</a>. We've added all of the ones that are shown in the ad scan that have been discounted, but expect to see even more sets on sale in the coming days. The best deal right now - a LEGO City Space Science Lab for only $19.99 (originally $35) - would make a great gift for kids. At an average cost of a mere 3.5 cents per brick, this deal is a phenomenal value.</p></div><p id="lego-sets"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="LEGO Sets">More Black Friday LEGO Deals</h3></p><div catalogid="19e8ee55-2ffc-4ace-a6aa-1417133b8b05" id="211553"><div id="211553" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sony PlayStation 5 Slim Disc Console</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony released their entire set of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024">Black Friday PlayStation deals</a> last week and most major retailers have followed suit. The best deal is definitely on the consoles themselves: the PS5 Slim Disc Edition has dropped to $424.99 (originally $500) and the PS5 Slim Digital Edition has dropped to $374.99 (originally $450). I would choose the Disc Edition because it's only $50 more and then I have the option to buy (and later sell or trade) physical disc media. Target doesn't carry the "Fortnite Cobalt Star" bundle but all that includes is a couple of Fortnite skins and in-game currency. If you want to save some money and go the Digital Edition route, I would suggest getting the NBA 2K25 bundle, which also includes a game.</p></div><p id="playstation-5-console"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="PlayStation 5 Console">More PlayStation Black Friday Deals</h3></p><div catalogid="56b24fb1-b74e-4b45-8835-20eee9ba9746" id="211428"><div id="211428" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars: Outlaws was released only 3 months ago, and it's already 33% off for Black Friday. Maybe Ubisoft is trying to boost sales after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales">lackluster sales at launch</a>, but that means you get to enjoy a AAA title at a great discount. IGN's Tristan Ogilvie gave it a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review">7/10 review</a>, but I've beaten the game and I immensely enjoyed it and would give it at least an 8. It definitely has a "Assassin's Creed game in a Star Wars skin" vibe, and there's nothing wrong with that.</p></div><p id="ps5-and-xbox-video-games"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="PS5 and Xbox Video Games">More Black Friday Video Game Deals for PS5/Xbox</h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Target isn't the only retailer with games already on sale.

I thought that this was going to be the official Black Friday deal. Alas, Target (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-breaks-nintendo-amazon-freeze-black-friday">but not Amazon, due to their supposedly shaky relationship</a>) has just knocked another $75 off the price tag.

This is Apple's best watch, with a titanium case that's more rugged and corrosion resistant than the softer aluminum casing found in most Apple Watches. Pure titanium (not titanium "coated") metal is considerably more expensive and is one of the main reasons why the Apple Watch Ultra commands a high price tag. The size of the case is also larger at 49mm (compared to 41mm-45mm for the Series 8). Other upgrades over the Series 8 include a brighter display protected by a scratch resistant sapphire crystal face, a precise dual-frequency GPS, beam-forming triple microphone array, dual speakers, up to 36 hours of battery life, up to 100m (300ft) of water resistance, a customizable physical action button next to the crown, and a built-in Oceanic+ app that literally puts a dive computer on your wrist. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
