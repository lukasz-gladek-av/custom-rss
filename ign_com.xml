            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/among-us-devs-found-a-reference-to-their-game-in-deltarune-toby-fox-responds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/among-us">Among Us</a> developer Innersloth has found a reference to its game in the new chapters of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deltarune-full-release">Deltarune</a>, sparking a little bit of friendly back-and-forth between Innersloth and Deltarune developer Toby Fox on social media.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning! </strong></em><em>No major plot spoilers will be discussed in this article, but if you don't want to know anything about anything that happens in Deltarune Chapter 4, maybe this article isn't for you!</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The reference can be found at the start of Chapter 4, when Kris, Susie, and Noelle are exploring Noelle's house. Kris can lead the gang into a closet full of empty gift boxes, and if Kris chooses to examine several of the boxes, Noelle will ask Kris what they're doing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To this, Susie reponds, "I mean... gotta admit this room is kinda sus... especially that vent." Noelle then replies, "Haha, nice reference, Susie!" ...though Susie doesn't seem to know what Noelle is talking about ("Huh? ...reference?")</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Susie was, of course, accidentally calling to mind Among Us, both by using the word "sus" and referencing vents, which Among Us players frequently hide in. This has seemingly thrilled the Innersloth social media person, who <a href="https://x.com/AmongUsGame/status/1932974746993557525" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to X / Twitter to say</a>, "AHHHHH AMONG US REFERENCE IN DELTARUNE SKDJDSLSLX;LSKDK IMMA CRASH OUT" followed by "thanks king @tobyfox"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Fox decided to do a little trolling:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/2D52MGxkrD" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2D52MGxkrD</a></p>â€” tobyfox (@tobyfox) <a href="https://twitter.com/tobyfox/status/1933018467537727567?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">He posted a fake screenshot of Deltarune patch notes, which read:</p><blockquote>We are releasing a hotfix for PC &amp; Mac to remedy some issues occurring in the game. You can confirm the version number on the bottom right of the file select screen.</blockquote><blockquote>Changelist</blockquote><blockquote>Ch4 v.0.0.088 8</blockquote><blockquote>Removed among us</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Innersloth replied with "RESPECT." If it's not apparent, Fox didn't actually remove the reference; he's just goofing around. Funnily enough, this gag is also a silly way to note that Fox has been playing around with version numbers: the 2021 release of chapters 1 and 2 was marked as version 1.0, but instead of chapters 3 and 4 being 2.0, the new release was v.0.0.087.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune chapters 3 and 4 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-are-out-now-and-its-already-exploding-on-steam">launched last week to immediate skyrocketing popularity on Steam</a>, and our own reviewer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-review">gave the full game a 9/10</a>, saying that even though the story's only halfway done, "Deltarune's incredible story is already bursting with hilarious charm, unforgettable characters, and an iconic soundtrack that make it worth investing your time in."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
