It is my hope that pressure from creators and the community might encourage EA’s leadership to reconsider the long-term impact of this sale and to preserve the values that have made The Sims so beloved," she wrote in a heartfelt message on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxPVv5K6a9ZXkFzbLrta3DlHckpC8A9OF6" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/sims-4-content-creators-leaving-creator-network/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This means that I will no longer receive early access to Sims packs, and I will not have a creator code. Under this new ownership, I feel I cannot maintain a direct association to the company. I also truly believe that they benefit more from my early access content than I do, and I think that stepping away is the strongest action I can take against the sale."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">She continued: "This situation is a nightmare for our community. Nobody supports this sale, and it is putting creators in a very difficult position. They have built their entire career and livelihood over a game that they have no control over. I ask that you please not harass other Sims creators over their decisions regarding the game and the creator network. I am very fortunate to be in a position where I can make a choice like this, but not everyone has that ability. I don't truly don't believe there is a 'right' answer here, and everyone is still trying to figure out their next steps."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sims closed on writing: "I'm really, really distraught over this sale, and I know that many of you are as well. It's scary, and it's breaking my heart. I really appreciate your support as I try to navigate this."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Sims 4 Gameplay Screenshots (2024)</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Jesse "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Plumbella/videos" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Plumbella</u></a>" McNamara, <a href="https://youtube.com/post/Ugkx5Ol31tHs5MyZKwBMepJPVh4LNkl4H38a?si=bd8mjuEu0ZFN4MNb" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DevonBumpkin</u></a>, <a href="https://youtube.com/post/UgkxOVNgt8bZHpzd70ukBORYepwkBgAh1wH1?si=_pOjqk8gqoXbaPR7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vixella</u></a>, and <a href="https://youtube.com/post/UgkxGxA76frKUAO6anFj84Ijhqkc4m-jlznc?si=nnF2WNkSnOAFw9e2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>James Turner</u></a> have all similarly quit EA's Creator Network.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Due to the recent sale, I have asked to leave the EA Creator Network, and I will not buy or make content around any future release," McNamara <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxe7pZtIiCBZpCErpuc1fqI3k41pAsna53" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think taking this stand is the right choice for me personally, but I’m not going to judge anybody on their decision.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has chosen to remain silent after Donald Trump released an AI image of the U.S. president as Master Chief and the Department of Homeland Security used Halo to promote ICE on social media.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-white-house-wades-into-the-console-wars-releases-ai-image-of-donald-trump-as-master-chief-saluting-in-front-of-an-american-flag-that-contains-a-big-mistake">IGN reported on how the White House had waded into the console wars with an AI image of Donald Trump saluting as Master Chief</a> in front of an American flag with only 40 stars.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Power to the Players <a href="https://t.co/GqNu0qdgmw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/GqNu0qdgmw</a> <a href="https://t.co/4Hw6G7i7aW" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/4Hw6G7i7aW</a></p>— The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1982638578913206632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It followed Microsoft’s announcement of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, a remake of the campaign of 2001’s Halo: Combat Evolved, which is due out on Xbox Series X and S, PC, and PlayStation 5 at some point in 2026. It is the first Halo game ever to launch on a PlayStation console, and cements Microsoft’s position as a multiplatform video game developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The U.S. administration then doubled down on the Halo AI images, with the Department of Homeland Security using Halo to promote the Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s website (ICE).</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Finishing this fight. <a href="https://t.co/6Ezq9NUqMq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6Ezq9NUqMq</a></p>— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) <a href="https://twitter.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The social media posts have sparked a vociferous response from Halo fans, which led to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1ohjpkg/white_house_twitter_posts_donald_trump_is_johns/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Halo subreddit changing its enforcement rules</a>. Mods usually remove any posts containing “politics and AI slop,” but such was the desire to discuss the tweets, they made an exception.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft, however, has so far remained silent on the issue. The company is yet to issue IGN a statement, but a representative told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/us-government-uses-halo-images-in-a-call-to-destroy-immigration-microsoft-declines-to-comment/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a> that "Microsoft does not have anything to share on this matter."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is in contrast to The Pokémon Company’s position. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this">It formally responded</a> to the use of Pokémon TV hero Ash Ketchum and the series' theme tune by the Department of Homeland Security as part of a video showing people being arrested and handcuffed by law enforcement agents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are aware of a recent video posted by the Department of Homeland Security that includes imagery and language associated with our brand," The Pokémon Company International said in a statement shared with IGN. "Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is, can Microsoft do anything about Trump and his administration using Halo for promotion? Many fans had suggested The Pokémon Company should defend its intellectual property by launching legal action. But the corporation's former legal chief told IGN at the time that he "wouldn't touch this."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/gettyimages-697897968-1761659255144.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Trump listens to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella during an American Technology Council roundtable at the White House on June 19, 2017.

"First, think of how little you see [The Pokémon Company International]'s name in the press. They are INSANELY publicity-shy and prefer to let the brand be the brand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Second, many of their execs in the USA are on green cards," he continued. "Even if I was still at the company I wouldn't touch this, and I'm the most trigger-happy CLO [Chief Legal Officer] I've ever met. This will blow over in a couple of days and they'll be happy to let it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Trump administration has form when it comes to using AI images to promote the President. In May, Trump sparked a backlash from some Catholics after posting an AI-generated image of himself as the Pope. The picture, which was shared by official White House social media accounts, was released as Catholics mourned the death of Pope Francis and prepared to choose the next pontiff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The White House has also released AI images of Trump as Superman and as a Star Wars Jedi. And when the Department of Homeland Security used South Park to promote ICE, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/us-homeland-security-uses-south-park-to-promote-ice-south-park-trolls-trump-in-response-wait-so-we-are-relevant">South Park trolled Trump in response, saying: “wait, so we ARE relevant?”</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've been missing Jimmy and still long for a Bully sequel, we may have the next best thing. While Rockstar hasn't delivered Bully 2 yet — and where there's life, there's hope — a dedicated team of modders has created an entire online mode to keep you occupied in the meantime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"IT'S HAPPENING!" developer SWEGTA announced on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J0_BnWKvEA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube</u></a>. "We finally have an online mode for Bully that allows you and your friends to play minigames, roleplay, compete in racing, fend off against NPCs, and much more!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a project me and my team have been working on for a very long time," SWEGTA added, "and it's finally at a point in development where we can announce it and show it to the public.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Bully Online runs on the DSL script loader, which is a plugin for Bully that essentially allows for a more versatile approach to modding. A lot of the things we thought were impossible just a few years ago can now be done, including making an online mode. We do have an official server for Bully Online, and we plan on making that available to the public to enjoy in due time."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting in December, the team will be making the server available to people who support the project on Ko-Fi, along with previews, videos, screenshots, and developer commentary. The server itself is described as a "bit of a mix" between minigames, free roaming, and role-playing, and has a "fully fleshed out" inventory system that permits players to earn money in-game and spend it on a "wide variety of different things like housing, weapons, vehicles, and items."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for if there'll ever be an official follow up? Dan Houser, Rockstar Games co-founder and the writer behind the studio's biggest games, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/grand-theft-auto"><u>Grand Theft Auto</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption"><u>Red Dead Redemption</u></a> series, recently sat down for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ign-in-conversation-with-dan-houser-at-la-comic-con-2025"><u>an exclusive interview with IGN</u></a>, revealing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-just-cant-do-all-the-projects-you-want-rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-says-bully-2-didnt-happen-due-to-bandwidth-issues"><u>Bully 2</u> didn't happen because of "bandwidth issues."</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bully — also known as Canis Canem Edit in some parts of the world — was a humorous action game that put players in the role of high school outcast Jimmy while attending a pretentious private school. "Bully is a great, well-crafted action game that's been made even stronger with one of the best senses of humor around," IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/16/bully-review"><u>Bully review</u></a> read. "Expect dozens and dozens of hours of fun."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have long called for a sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-rockstar-developers-share-details-on-the-development-of-the-cancelled-bully-2"><u>which was once in development at Rockstar’s New England studio in the late 2000s</u></a>. While Bully 2 was obviously never released, some of its ideas made it into other Rockstar games like Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
