            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-april-10-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not saying today’s deals are going to ruin your budget, but I wouldn’t open your banking app until tomorrow. Stellar Crown is back in stock (finally), and Amazon also has the Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection if you're feeling like a true Tera master. Meanwhile, Lenovo quietly dropped Xbox Wireless Controllers to $39.99, and I’m just over here trying to convince myself I <em>don’t</em> need one in every color.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Stellar Crown Boxes and $25 off Xbox Series X/S Controllers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, there’s a new Humble Bundle that looks like someone dumped every neon-drenched game into one lineup, and somehow Fallout fans are getting a $200 Pip-Boy replica that actually works as a clock. It's a chaotic mix of gaming greatness, and I'm into it.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-terapagos-ex-ultra-pre"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Pre"> Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218494"><div id="218494" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I want this box purely for the overkill. Eighteen booster packs, three promo cards, and enough accessories to make a Magic: The Gathering player cry. Terapagos ex, Lapras ex, and Cinderace ex look gorgeous, and the display-worthy gear (card protector, playmat, deck box) makes this feel like more than just another TCG drop. It’s overstuffed, overpriced, over the top and exactly what I want from a premium Pokémon box.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-stella"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Stella">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Stellar Crown Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218495"><div id="218495" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Stellar Crown Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think the Stellar Crown ETB is one of the best recent Pokémon releases, and not just because it includes a full-art Noctowl. The sleeves featuring Stellar Form Terapagos are slick, and you get nine booster packs — nine! For under $55, that’s a solid entry point into Scarlet &amp; Violet or just a fun rip session waiting to happen. If you missed the last drop, now’s your shot at redemption.</p></div><p id="neon-lights-game-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Neon Lights Game Bundle">Neon Lights Game Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218496"><div id="218496" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Neon Lights Game Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pay less to get fewer items, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity Xperience Studios</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle is like a cyberpunk fever dream. Ghostrunner, Neon Abyss, and The Red Strings Club all in one lineup? I don't even care that I’ve already played half of these. For $14, I’ll happily double-dip just to have them in one place. I want more game bundles that feel like a hacker curated them at 3 a.m. while jacked into a mainframe.</p></div><p id="microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Microsoft Xbox Wireless Controller -">Microsoft Xbox Wireless Controller - Various Colors</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218497"><div id="218497" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Microsoft Xbox Wireless Controller - Astral Purple</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Use Code "SPRINGBACK" More Colors Available</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, Xbox controllers never go on sale when you need one — only when your current one starts drifting mid-match and your rage googling leads you here. $39.99 is a no-brainer price, especially with options like Astral Purple and Deep Pink in stock. I already have two, but I want a third just because Microsoft had the audacity to make them this pretty.</p></div><p id="fallout-pip-boy-die-cast-replica"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fallout - Pip-Boy Die-Cast - Replica">Fallout - Pip-Boy Die-Cast - Replica</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218498"><div id="218498" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout - Pip-Boy Die-Cast - Replica</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, I don't need a $200 Pip-Boy replica with a functioning LCD screen, clock, and radio. But I absolutely want it. It’s absurdly detailed, looks screen-accurate, and would make a great desk flex or cosplay showpiece. I think if you’re the type to own a vault jumpsuit, this is your holy grail.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-booste"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Booste">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Booster Display Box</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218499"><div id="218499" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Booster Display Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think of this as the “no regrets” box. Thirty-six booster packs is a full-on dopamine factory for collectors or anyone building out a Scarlet &amp; Violet deck. You’re getting the Tera Pokémon ex mechanics, fan favorites like Koraidon and Miraidon, and honestly, more chances at pulls than I usually trust myself with. I want this in my cart and hidden from my partner. It’s a big upfront price, but when you break it down, it’s solid value for serious collectors.</p></div><p id="monster-energy-zero-ultra-sugar-fre"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Monster Energy Zero Ultra, Sugar Fre">Monster Energy Zero Ultra, Sugar Free Energy Drink, 16 Ounce (Pack of 15)</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218500"><div id="218500" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Monster Energy Zero Ultra, Sugar Free Energy Drink, 16 Ounce (Pack of 15)</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Unlock coupon by choosing Subscribe and Save. Applies to first sub only.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I want to believe I drink Monster Zero Ultra for the energy, but deep down I know it’s just my gamer juice of choice. $26.11 for a 15-pack works out to about $1.74 per can, which is cheaper and less effort than running to a 7-Elevan. Bonus points for the Subscribe &amp; Save option, which is where this deal kicks in.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-surg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surg">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218398"><div id="218398" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been tracking the <em>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet – Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</em> for weeks, and while this <strong>$45.02</strong> price on Amazon is still above the original MSRP of <strong>$26.94</strong>, it’s the most reasonable listing I’ve seen that doesn’t involve a sketchy seller or a mystery warehouse. You get six booster packs from the latest set, which is hard enough to find in stores, and I appreciate not having to overpay a reseller just to get in on the new pulls. For anyone trying to keep up with the expansion, this is as straightforward as it gets.</p></div><p id="iniu-140w-power-bank"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU 140W Power Bank">INIU 140W Power Bank</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218399"><div id="218399" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU 140W Power Bank</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think the <strong>INIU 140W 27,000mAh Power Bank</strong> is the backup battery I actually trust when I know I’ll be away from an outlet for more than a few hours. It’s currently <strong>$74.56</strong>, which isn’t exactly pocket change, but for something that can charge a MacBook Pro or a Steam Deck without breaking a sweat, I’d say it’s well-priced. The digital display is genuinely useful, and having three ports (two USB-C and one USB-A) makes it easy to keep everything charged without doing the cable shuffle.</p></div><p id="fallout-lucys-vault-33-backpack"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fallout - Lucys Vault 33 - Backpack">Fallout - Lucys Vault 33 - Backpack</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218400"><div id="218400" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout - Lucys Vault 33 - Backpack</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t usually get excited about merch, but the Fallout – Lucy’s Vault 33 Backpack from the IGN Store actually feels like something I’d use. It’s $199.99, which sounds steep until you realize it’s a legit replica built from the same patterns used on the show. This isn’t a cheap cosplay throw-in, it’s got a full 20L capacity, a 16-inch laptop pocket, and more compartments than I know what to do with. Plus, it comes with that massive yellow fleece blanket for the full Fallout-core vibe. I’m not planning on trekking across a wasteland anytime soon, but it’s good to know the bag is ready just in case.</p></div><p id="iniu-power-bank-20000mah-65w"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU Power Bank, 20000mAh 65W">INIU Power Bank, 20000mAh 65W</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218401"><div id="218401" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU Power Bank, 20000mAh 65W</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Use on-site coupon for full discount</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">INIU 65W 20,000mAh Power Bank is the one I reach for when I need power without the bulk. It's $39.99 and still strong enough to fast-charge my laptop, but compact enough to throw in a backpack without thinking about it. The extra port flexibility is nice, and the built-in phone stand is one of those small features I didn’t think I’d care about until I started using it constantly. It just does its job well without getting in the way.</p></div><p id="humble-heroines-game-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Humble Heroines Game Bundle">Humble Heroines Game Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218402"><div id="218402" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Humble Heroines Game Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pay less to get fewer items, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charities Girls Who Code and Girl Make Game Scholarship Fund.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Humble Heroines: Rebels, Curses, and Mystery bundle is exactly the kind of thing I buy and then spend the next six months working through. For $12, you get seven games including Control: Ultimate Edition, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, Darksiders III, and a few smaller indie gems that deserve the attention. The lineup is solid, the value is obvious, and part of the money goes to Girls Who Code and Girls Make Games, so I don’t even have to justify it to myself. It’s a good excuse to grab some character-driven games that don’t all feel like the same recycled formula.</p></div><p id="iniu-power-bank-100w"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU Power Bank 100W">INIU Power Bank 100W</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218404"><div id="218404" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU Power Bank 100W</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up the INIU 100W 25,000mAh Power Bank because I wanted one charger that could handle everything without fuss. For $53.98, I get enough power to charge two larger devices at once, thanks to dual USB-C outputs, and it still recharges fast when it’s drained. It’s well-balanced in size and performance, and I haven’t run into overheating or throttling issues even during heavy use. That’s more than I can say for a few others I’ve retired.</p></div><p id="iniu-portable-charger-slim-45w"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU Portable Charger, Slim 45W">INIU Portable Charger, Slim 45W</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218405"><div id="218405" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU Portable Charger, Slim 45W</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the INIU Slim 45W 10,000mAh Power Bank with Built-In USB-C Cable It's currently $22.49, but the real win here is the integrated cable. It charges both the power bank and my phone, which is ideal when I want to carry as little as possible. The compact build doesn’t compromise on speed, and I like that I can toss it in a jacket pocket without it feeling like dead weight. It’s simple, efficient, and takes up no mental space.</p></div><p id="asus-rog-cetra-true-wireless-gaming"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="ASUS ROG Cetra True Wireless Gaming ">ASUS ROG Cetra True Wireless Gaming Headphones</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218329"><div id="218329" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>ASUS ROG Cetra True Wireless Gaming Headphones</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve tried more wireless earbuds than I care to admit, but the Cetra lineup actually gets it right for gaming. I want latency low enough that my killshots sync with the sound of glory, not a second later. These deliver that, with the added bonus of active noise cancelation that’s good enough to block out my neighbor’s saxophone practice. The 27-hour battery life doesn’t hurt either, especially for marathon gaming sessions — or, let’s be honest, Netflix binges. Wireless charging is just the lazy cherry on top.</p></div><p id="asus-rog-harpe-gaming-wireless-mouse"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="ASUS ROG Harpe Gaming Wireless Mouse">ASUS ROG Harpe Gaming Wireless Mouse</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218330"><div id="218330" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>ASUS ROG Harpe Gaming Wireless Mouse</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This thing weighs 54 grams. Fifty-four. I’ve had granola bars that were heavier. I think it’s illegal to call something this light a “mouse” without an asterisk. The Harpe’s low-latency tri-mode connection and snappy AimPoint sensor make it feel like an extension of my brain. If you’re the type to tweak DPI mid-match just because you can, this one’s built for you. Also, shout out to ASUS for not naming it something ridiculous like “ShadowFang X69 Ultra.”</p></div><p id="vampire-hunter-d-book-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Vampire Hunter D Book Bundle">Vampire Hunter D Book Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218331"><div id="218331" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Vampire Hunter D Book Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pay less to get fewer items, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity World Central Kitchen</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the deal: for less than the price of a mediocre pizza, you get 29 volumes of vampire-fighting, post-apocalyptic drama illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano. I want this bundle just so I can say I finally read the source material instead of quoting the anime like a poser. And since it supports World Central Kitchen, I've checked off my good deed for the day whilst reading about bloodthirsty aristocrats. Win-win.</p></div><p id="asus-rog-spatha-x-wireless-gaming-mo"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="ASUS ROG Spatha X Wireless Gaming Mo">ASUS ROG Spatha X Wireless Gaming Mouse</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218332"><div id="218332" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>ASUS ROG Spatha X Wireless Gaming Mouse</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If the Harpe is the Ferrari of gaming mice, the Spatha is a tank with RGB. I mean, 12 programmable buttons, a magnetic charging stand, and enough battery life to outlast the apocalypse? I think this one’s for the MMO players and spreadsheet warriors who want their macros locked and loaded. The hot-swappable switches are a nice bonus for anyone who treats mice like seasonal accessories.</p></div><p id="street-fighter-trading-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Street Fighter Trading Cards">Street Fighter Trading Cards</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218333"><div id="218333" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Street Fighter Trading Cards</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>From $20, with the Warriors Dreams Master Case retailing at $960</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I grew up spamming Hadoukens, and now I can channel that energy into shiny cardboard form. I want the Collector Box because ripping open packs and chasing rare inserts scratches an itch I didn’t know I had. But if you’re a “go big or go home” kind of collector, the Inner Case ($240) or Master Case ($960) options are basically loot crates for adults — minus the digital regret.</p></div><p id="asus-rog-falchion-nx-65-wireless-rg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="ASUS ROG Falchion NX 65% Wireless RG">ASUS ROG Falchion NX 65% Wireless RGB Gaming Mechanical Keyboard</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218334"><div id="218334" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>ASUS ROG Falchion NX 65% Wireless RGB Gaming Mechanical Keyboard</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t always want a full keyboard taking up half my desk. The Falchion understands that. It's compact, mechanical, and still manages to squeeze in arrow keys and a weirdly satisfying touch panel for volume and macros. I love that it’s wireless but still offers USB-C when I’m feeling traditional. Bonus points for the cover case—it makes me feel like I’m carrying a fancy typewriter to a LAN party.</p></div><p id="asus-rog-strix-scope-rx-tkl-wireless"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="ASUS ROG Strix Scope RX TKL Wireless">ASUS ROG Strix Scope RX TKL Wireless Deluxe</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218335"><div id="218335" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>ASUS ROG Strix Scope RX TKL Wireless Deluxe</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one’s a mouthful in name and a handful in features. I think this keyboard is perfect for anyone who wants their setup to scream “I game and I have taste.” The wrist rest is plush, the switches are fast and precise, and the tri-mode connection lets me hop from work laptop to gaming rig like some sort of digital nomad. It’s absurdly overbuilt, and I kind of respect that.</p></div><p id="maingear-north-rtx-5070"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MainGear North RTX 5070">MainGear North RTX 5070</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218237"><div id="218237" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MainGear North RTX 5070</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this is one of the smartest ways to get your hands on an RTX 5070 without building from scratch or skimping on quality. MAINGEAR’s setup skips all the common bottlenecks — no mismatched parts, no airflow nightmares, no “good enough” corners cut. For $2,095, you’re getting a clean combo of a Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, 16GB of DDR5 RGB RAM, and a 1TB NVMe SSD, all assembled by people who care about things like cable management. It’s future-ready, quiet, and fast enough to leave your current rig feeling like a potato in comparison.</p></div><p id="pokemon-tcg-azure-legends-tin-5-p"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin - 5 P">Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin - 5 Packs</h2></p><div catalogid="a92f7e65-9fbb-440d-a20b-378b15be4a8b" id="218238"><div id="218238" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin - 5 Packs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This tin is pure Pokémon chaos in the best way.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-devs-arent-fans-of-the-pokemon-with-guns-moniker<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">What do you think of when you think of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a>? Unfortunately for the folks who made it, the answer is pretty likely to immediately be, “Pokemon with guns.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s because when the game first exploded into popularity, that’s the shorthand everyone on the internet used for it, likely contributing to its rise thanks to the odd combination of two unlike ideas. Heck, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-snaps-up-pokmon-with-guns-game-palworld-for-game-pass-release-date-confirmed"><u>we at IGN</u></a> are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-insists-that-its-pokmon-with-guns-survival-game-is-not-a-scam"><u>guilty of using the phrase</u></a> too, just like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22pokemon+with+guns%22&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS1008US1008&amp;oq=%22pokemon+with+guns%22&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDIHCAIQABiABDIICAMQABgWGB4yCAgEEAAYFhgeMgYIBRBFGEAyBggGEEUYQDIGCAcQRRhA0gEINDU1NGowajSoAgCwAgDxBSg3gEcuecCb&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>everyone else</u></a>. It was convenient and easy for those who had never heard of the game to immediately understand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But according to Pocketpair communications director and publishing manager John ‘Bucky’ Buckley, “Pokemon with guns” was never intended to be the takeaway. In fact, he says that Pocketpair largely doesn’t <em>love</em> the moniker. He said this in a talk at the Game Developers Conference last month, when he discussed the initial rise to fame of Palworld in 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We revealed the game to the world in June of 2021, so quite a few years ago. We posted a trailer at what's called Indie Live Expo, which is an indie gaming event in Japan. We showed this off to the Japanese audience initially, we had a really, really good reception. But very quickly, Western media got eyes on this little game, and we were very quickly branded, as early as 2021, as a ‘certain franchise’ plus guns. This would be something that has stuck with us to this very day, despite our best efforts to shake that off.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After his talk, I spoke with Buckley in an interview and asked him to elaborate on this. Buckley responded that Pokemon was never really part of the pitch to begin with. Sure, the development team is largely composed of fans of the game, and they clocked the monster-collecting similarities. But the goal was always to be more like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ark-survival-evolved">ARK: Survival Evolved</a> instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of us are huge ARK people, and our previous game, Craftopia, kind of has some stuff in it that we really loved from ARK and some ideas from ARK,” he said. “So we wanted to just take that and make it bigger. And one of the things about ARK, is that everything’s about the dinosaurs. Some are cute, some are cool. But we wanted to give them more personality, more abilities, more uniqueness. So that was the pitch. The pitch was, let's make something like ARK, but a lot heavier on the automation and each creature's like its own very special thing. And then we show that first trailer, and then this title kind of came out. And no, we weren't super happy about it, but it is what it is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I asked Buckley if he thinks the “Pokemon with guns” label helped Palworld become as successful as it was, and he acknowledges it did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, I mean, that was big,” he said. “That was definitely a big thing. Dave [Oshry] from New Blood [Interactive, publisher of Dusk, Fallen Aces, and others] messaged us because he trademarked the website, ‘Pokemonwithguns.com’ and stuff. All this kind of stuff happened, and I'm sure that fueled that fire, which is fair enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But still today, 2025, if people want to say [“Pokemon with guns”], that's fine. But the thing that upsets us, I guess, a little bit, is the people who firmly believe that's what the game actually is. But it's not even remotely like that to play the game. So if you want to say that after playing, that's fine, but we'd rather everyone give it a bit of a chance first.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Buckley also doesn’t feel that Pokemon is even a meaningful source of market competition with Palworld. “I don’t think the audiences cross over that much,” he said, again pointing to ARK as a neater parallel. Even then, though, he doesn’t feel Palworld is fighting with anyone else in particular for an audience of players. Not even Helldivers 2, which he said a “very significant” portion of Palworld players also bought on release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I've <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1881483215208329464" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>gotten in trouble for ranting about the ‘console wars’ before</u></a>, but I think the competition in games is kind of manufactured for the sake of it,” he said. “Almost like a meta-marketing kind of strategy. I don't really think there is competition in games. I mean, there's so many games right now. How can you be in competition with one or two? It doesn't really make sense anymore. We're just always in competition with the timing [of releases] more than anything, I think.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if “Pokemon with guns” is out, what tagline would Buckley have had go viral, if he could have had his way?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I probably would've called it, ‘Palworld: It's Kind of Like ARK if ARK Met Factorio and Happy Tree Friends’ or something like that. That’s how I might’ve said it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I told him it doesn’t quite roll off the tongue the same, to which he agrees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough"><u>Buckley and I also spoke about the</u></a> possibility of Palworld coming to the Nintendo Switch 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-developer-unlikely-to-be-acquired-our-ceo-would-never-allow-it">whether Pocketpair would ever be acquired</a>, and much more in our interview.

During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals (a claim that the person who originally made it has since retracted). He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> a bit on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” to the studio and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve already run a number of shorter stories on some of the highlights of our conversation with Buckley, but given the depth of insight he provided on Pocketpair’s community struggles and triumphs, we decided to publish the full extended interview here as well. If you’re looking for something a bit shorter and easier to follow, you can read at these links on Buckley’s comments about the possibility of Palworld <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough">coming to the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, the studio’s reaction to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-devs-arent-fans-of-the-pokemon-with-guns-moniker">the game being called “Pokemon with guns”</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-developer-unlikely-to-be-acquired-our-ceo-would-never-allow-it">whether Pocketpair would ever be acquired</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This interview has been lightly edited for clarity:
<strong>IGN: I'm going to get the really annoying one that I know you can't really answer out of the way first. You talked so, so lightly about the lawsuit in your GDC talk. Has that lawsuit made it harder for Pocketpair to move forward and update the game, having that still pending?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Buckley:</strong> No, it hasn't made it harder to update the game or to move forward. It's just kind of something that weighs over you all the time. It's something that everyone's always thinking about, but it hasn't made the game harder to update. It hasn't affected development in that regard. It's just kind of affected the company's morale more than anything else. And obviously, lawyers have to be hired and stuff like that, of course, of course, but I'm not involved in any of that, and really no one else at the company is other than the top, right? It's just morale more than anything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Okay, real conversation time. I was fascinated at the start of your talk when you talked about, sort of cheekily, the ‘Pokemon with guns’ moniker. I was surprised that you didn't seem to like that. Can I ask why?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: A lot of people don't believe us when we say this, but I think a lot of people think that was written on a whiteboard before the game development started, like, “This is the goal," but it never was. We always wanted to make something that was kind of like ARK: Survival Evolved, but with a lot more automation and with a bit more personality to each of the creatures, because a lot of us are huge ARK people, and our previous game, Craftopia, kind of has some stuff in it that we really loved from ARK and some ideas from ARK. So we wanted to just take that and make it bigger. And one of the things that ARK, everything's done with the dinosaurs, and the dinosaurs, some of them are cute, but we wanted to give them more personality, more abilities, more uniqueness. So that was the pitch. The pitch was, let's make something like ARK, but a lot heavier on the automation and each creature's like its own very special thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then we show that first trailer, and then this title kind of came out. And no, we weren't super happy about it, but it is what it is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You said in the talk that you didn't understand why Palworld took off the way it did, you couldn't explain it. And I'm not a market analyst, so I certainly couldn't tell you, but I do feel like I specifically remember when "Pokemon with guns" came into the conversation.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Yeah. No, I mean, that was big. That was definitely a big thing. I mean, Dave [Oshry] Dave from New Blood messaged us because he trademarked the website, Pokemonwithguns.com and stuff. All this kind of stuff happened, and I'm sure that fueled that fire, which is fair enough. But still today, 2025, if people want to say that, that's fine. But the thing that upsets us, I guess, a little bit is the people who firmly believe that's what the game actually is. But it's not even remotely like that to play the game. So if you want to say that after playing, that's fine, but we'd rather everyone give it a bit of a chance first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Well, how would you have phrased it? What would've been your "moniker" for this?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I probably would've called it, “Palworld: It's kind of like ARK if ARK met Factorio and Happy Tree Friends, or something like that. That's how I might've said it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It doesn't quite roll off the tongue the same way.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: No, no, it doesn't, does it? Maybe that's why.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Another thing that you brought up in the talk were the criticisms people made saying the game was AI slop. How did that impact folks internally at Pocketpair?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Massively, massively, massively, massively. That is by far I would say the biggest kind of thing that was ever against us, still to this day. Go to any Palworld posts or any news article about Palworld, or Reddit post, you'll see someone say, "I hate this company. They use AI," and it's complete nonsense. It's upsetting. It's something that upsets everyone, but at different levels. It's the artists especially who really, really take it the worst, especially our Pal concept artists. We have a few Pal concept artists, and two of them in particular who've been there since day one. They're not big fans of this kind of stuff, but it's very hard to counter this, which we did learn. I talked about that. The easy idea is to put everyone in front of a camera and have them talk about it, but none of our people want to be on camera.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yeah, when you gave your talk you mentioned people not wanting to be super visible online because the internet is bad.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Yeah, they don't want to be visible. And I'm not using it as an excuse, but the vast majority of our artists are female, and in Japan, it's not the way to go about things right now. So they don't want to be on camera, they don't want to be public, they don't want to have their names out there. And yeah, it's upsetting for them, still today it's very upsetting to hear these things. But like I said in my talk, we haven't really cracked how to properly refute this yet. We released an art book, and it definitely, definitely made a big impact, but not as much as we would've hoped, perhaps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>We are having this industry-wide conversation about generative AI and generative AI art, and people think that they're really good at spotting it, and you can't always. If something has seven weird fingers, it's probably pretty obvious, but less so in other cases, right?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: A lot of the arguments for ours, I think, again, I'm obviously biased towards this, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ai-palworld-accusations-are-currently-based-on-vibes-a-social-deduction-game-and-the-ceos-past-tweets-about-machine-generated-fakemon/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I think they're pretty hollow</a>. I mean, it all comes from comments that our CEO made in 2020, 2021-ish. There was a very famous Kotaku post. Before GenAI really became a thing, Kotaku made an article about it, and our CEO commented, "Sugoi," the Japanese word for amazing. People see the word amazing, and they think his reaction's like, "Whoa, this is incredible. I love this." And I think his intention was more just like a, "Look at this thing." I don't think he was too gung-ho on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, I think the thing that really kind of tipped it for people is in 2022, 2023, two people... So Pocketpair is what we call an open development company. So you join Pocketpair, and then you work on the game you want to work on rather than we're hiring you to specifically work on this. We check that you can do the work. You join the company. And then, you want to work on Craftopia? Cool. You want to work on Palword? Cool. You want to just do your own thing? Okay, we'll let you do that for a period of time, and if that might become something, maybe we can help you make that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, Never Grave, another game we're doing, actually came from that model of people having this idea, they pursued it, and we let them do it. Two or three members of Pocketpair made a game a few years ago called AI: Art Imposter, which is a party game. [<em>Author's note: AI Imposter does involve players generating AI images in a social deduction game format where the "imposter" isn't told the theme of the generation</em>.] Well, that didn't go down the way we thought it would go down. I think we all thought it would be a funny, ironic kind of a thing. Here's a party game where you're trying to catch out the person, but it didn't matter. People take that as our declaration of "We love GenAI." It'll be quite the opposite, but again, it is what it is. Art Imposter was popular in Japan, so like a lot of our games, we're happy that somewhere enjoyed it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What's your overall take on the state of, not your community specifically, but online gaming communities in general? You're talking about getting all that harassment and stuff, is social media broadly useful for you all anymore?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Well, social media's big for us. Funny enough, I went to a publisher roundtable yesterday, and it was very split in the middle, actually. The same question came up. Some of us think, yes, that's the way to go. Some people think it's not the way to go anymore. It's big for us. It's big for us because we are primarily an Asian market game. All of our games have been big in Japan and China and stuff, and these are places where social media is like people live and breathe it. You can't ignore it. Whereas over here, I know there's a bit more pushback. Online gaming communities, yeah, they can be very intense sometimes. I think people get very emotional sometimes and they get very swept away in those emotions, and I understand that. I mean, I used to play a lot of MMOs, a lot of PvP MMOs. That used to be my big thing before I got a real job. The communities, but I understand that people get swept away in things and you kind of lash out, and I get that. And there's a lot of people that lash out at us that I just kind of take on the chin. I'm like, "That's fine."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We sit in that office for 12 hours just living and breathing this game. It hurts us a lot more that these things happen.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's all this death-threat stuff. It's when it reaches that point where you're like, "How could you be this upset?" It's never that serious. And it's usually very illogical death threats. Maybe we release a patch that breaks something, and, "I'm going to kill you and put a knife in your neck." And I always just want to say, "Do you think we're not going to fix it? I mean, we'll obviously fix this, right? We didn't do this on purpose. We're not breaking your game on purpose."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I think the big thing that a lot of people don't sympathize with is you might play a game, you might play our game for three hours in a row, and then you experience a critical bug, and it crashes. That's a super frustrating experience. I 100% agree, I sympathize, I get it. But then you disconnect from it, and you go and do something else. We sit in that office for 12 hours just living and breathing this game. It hurts us a lot more that these things happen. So, I wish people would be a bit more sympathetic to these things, that we don't like it as much as they like it, and we're trying to fix these things. So, a bit of heat is fine. Spur of the moment insults is fine. I get it. We're all people, but it's the death threats that really get to us the most because it's so dumb.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you feel like social media is trending worse lately?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I think, especially these days, there's a lot more people on social media who just say the opposite thing because they know they'll get the reaction now. And it's trending a bit and there's a few big accounts that have become quite notorious for always seeming to be on the opposite side. A new game comes out and everyone's like, "This is great." There's always that crowd now that go, "Nope, this is not. It's bad," for all these reasons that have nothing to do with the game, basically, always. And I think that, I don't know, maybe social media is encouraging that recently. It gets the clicks, it gets the trends. Yeah, luckily, we don't get much of that. Palworld, weirdly enough, kind of has avoided a lot of these, I don't know, I don't know what you say, political and social stuff. We just get a lot of "The game's broken" kind of requests. That's what we get.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I thought it was really interesting in your talk that you said that the majority of the heat came from the Western audience. I guess I just assumed it would be equal across the board. Do you have any insight as to why that was?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: No, no, no, no. We've tried to figure this out too. We are quite a divisive company in Japan. It's a 50/50 in Japan of whether people love us or whether people really hate us. I don't know. I think not a lot of game companies in Japan make games for the overseas market. They make a game for home, and then it blows up overseas, whereas we always try to strike overseas first with the kind of Japanese flair to it. And we call ourselves indie a lot, which a lot of Japanese gamers don't like, unfortunately. Even though we firmly believe we're indie, but yeah, that's always contested back home. I don't know why we get a lot of heat overseas. Maybe it was just easy pickings at that time. It's simmered down a lot. It's very manageable now. But a lot of that, especially the death threats and stuff, were very much in English. We didn't get a lot of that in Japan or China.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So Palworld was extremely successful, and I get the sense, perhaps in a way that was maybe unexpected for you all based on your talk. Has that changed anything about how the studio runs or what your future plans are or anything else?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: It's changed our future plans, yes. It has not changed the studio. For better or worse, we remain basically unchanged.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You said the community team did not get bigger in response. Did the studio get bigger in other ways?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Yeah. I mean, our server team has grown. We're hiring more developers all the time. We're hiring more artists all the time. One of our sore points as a company is just making things quicker for the fans. So we're always trying to onboard as many developers as we can to kind of speed up development time. But the company culture hasn't changed that much. It's obviously bigger now, but we haven't reached that kind of tipping point yet. And our CEO really wants to avoid that because he's a very homebody kind of guy, so he wants to keep it small. I say small, it's 70 people now. That's a lot of people. He doesn't want to get into the hundreds, he says, anyway. But no, I mean, this level of success was unexpected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You knew it was a good game, but you didn't know that it was going to be </strong><em><strong>this </strong></em><strong>big.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I mean, a million sales for anyone, I think you've made it. Well, sorry. I said anyone. I mean a million sales for an indie game. You've made it. Congratulations. You're a platinum standard. Two million? Unbelievable. You should be screaming that from the roof. When you get into the 10 millions is when it just gets very surreal, and you don't really know what's happening anymore. And Steam is sending you, "Here's your monthly sales reports, and here's your monthly impression reports," and it's just numbers that don't make sense. And then you get a bit, not reckless, but you get a bit free with how you spend it and nothing happens. Yeah, it all gets very weird and surreal, and it's still hard for us to kind of get a grasp on it, basically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you anticipate that Palworld is something that Pocketpair is going to support for a really, really long time to come?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Palworld's definitely going nowhere. What form Palworld's going to take, I've no idea, but it's definitely going to be something that we're always sticking on. But we do want to kind of go back to making other stuff, too. We're still working on Craftopia. Even though everyone says we're not, we are still working on Craftopia. And there's people at the company who want to do their own thing as well, so we're trying to find ways to support all of that while also maintaining this machine that is Palworld. Because Palworld's kind of split into two things now, Palworld the game and Palworld the IP, and they're both kind of going on different trajectories right now.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Palworld's definitely going nowhere. What form Palworld's going to take, I've no idea.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yeah. You talked about that partnership that everybody misunderstood.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley:</strong> Yeah. No one understands. Someone, literally yesterday, said to me, "Why aren't you wearing a Sony jacket?" And I said, "Because we're not owned by Sony at all." No, that'll be forever misunderstood, I think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you think you guys ever would get acquired?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley: </strong>No. Our CEO would never allow it. He'd never allow it. He'd never allow it. He would never, never allow it. He likes doing his own thing and he likes being his own boss. He doesn't like people telling him what to do. So I would be shocked. Maybe when he's old, and he might just sell it off for money. And that would be sad, but in my lifetime, I probably won't see it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No, it'll be interesting to see where the two paths go. We, Pocketpair, are obviously only involved in where the game path is going. Palworld as an IP, we've given, not given, but we are involved, but very much in the hands of Aniplex and Sony Music who are steering that ship right now. We are just kind of offering our advice and thoughts as they take that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I know we talked earlier about the Palworld comparisons to a Pokemon, and that you actually feel it's more like ARK. ARK is not actively releasing brand new games every one to two years and has an anime and merch like the way Pokemon does, but Pokemon is gearing up. They've got a release this year. They're constantly doing stuff. Do you see that being competitive in any way or meaningfully impacting you all?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I don't think the audiences cross over that much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Really?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: And the systems are totally different. I mean, the systems are completely different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sure, but you all released after Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, which people including me were very critical of, and I remember seeing a lot of fans going, “Why can’t they just do what Pocketpair did?”</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I don't know. I think a lot of that's just people trying to stir the pot online. I see some of those comments all the time and I always think, "Come on, guys. Don't be silly now." I think they're just stirring the pot. I mean, we don't consider that as any kind of competition, or we don't want to be involved in that kind of dispute, basically. Ironically, we released alongside two other survival games, and we were more focused on them than we were anyone else, Nightingale and Enshrouded. And we very playfully back and forthed it together, because we are very similar games more than anything else. ARK. I mean, we don't see ARK as a competitor. We love the ARK guys. [Studio] Wildcard are sweethearts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't know. Competition in games is, I've gotten in trouble for ranting about the "console wars" before, but I think the competition in games is kind of manufactured for the sake of it. Almost like a meta marketing kind of strategy. I don't really think there is competition in games. I mean, there's so many games right now. How can you be in competition with one or two? It doesn't really make sense anymore. We're just always in competition with kind of the timing more than anything, I think. I mean, we pull a lot of telemetry and we work with a lot of data companies for these things. I don't know. The one that surprised me the most was a very significant portion of Palworld players bought Helldivers 2 on release. And that was a crossover that I was very surprised about…I think it's the co-op element, the kind of goofy element, having fun with your friends. I think Steam is really good at driving those big game releases as well. So, it's a perfect storm, really.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Would you ever release on the Switch?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: If we could make the game work on the Switch, we would, but Palworld's a beefy game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Switch 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buckley: Well, we haven't seen those specs yet, so we're like everyone else, we're waiting. I mean, I'm walking around GDC hoping someone will tell me them, but everyone I've spoken to says they haven't even seen them. If it's beefy enough, it's 100% worth considering. We did a lot of optimization for Steam Deck, which we were really happy with. Still work to do, but we were very happy with how it turned out. So we would like to get it on more handhelds if possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>My big takeaway from your talk is that outside of the existing Palworld community of people who have played and enjoyed the game, you feel that Palworld is extremely misunderstood.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: Yeah, 100%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What is your singular takeaway message for people who have not played it and you think misunderstand it?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I think a lot of people who only know of Palworld from the news and the drama and stuff, in just my opinion, probably completely misunderstand what the game even is. So I would say play it. I mean, I think we should do a demo at some point. Something that I campaign for a lot internally. At some point we should release a demo or some kind of free hour or something if we could figure it out to do it properly. But I think a lot of people who have never played it and only know it from the drama would be surprised if they played it for one hour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't think it's anything like what they imagine it is. We are nowhere near as seedy and scummy as people seem to think we are. I think it's the double-edged sword. We hid from the public to protect our developers, and at the same time, I think that made us look a bit inaccessible, which makes you look bad inherently. If we'd have been more public, maybe we wouldn't have got that reputation. It's two edges to that, but we have to protect our team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>That’s also just the way the internet works. Whatever other things there are to do in Palworld, what’s funny is a meme video of what is effectively distilled down to Pokemon with guns. So that's what everyone's sharing.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buckley</strong>: I mean, I think we're a very nice little company. We've done very well for ourselves with every game we've ever made, and we'll continue, hopefully, to always do well. I think last year was just such a crazy year for games. I think people don't appreciate how crazy last year was. I think people will write about 2024 five years from now. There were just so many unbelievably successful games last year. [Black Myth:] Wukong, Helldivers [2], Palworld, games that just hit numbers that are not normal. So I think emotions were high last year and people got swept away in the fun, maybe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-games-mitigates-the-sticker-shock-because-you-want-that-content-so-bad-ex-playstation-boss-says<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The former boss of Sony Interactive Entertainment America has commented on the backlash to Nintendo’s Switch 2 pricing, saying the desire for exclusive Nintendo games “mitigates the sticker shock.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Nintendo confirmed the Switch 2 price at $449.99, which is around $50 more than some analysts had predicted, and, more controversially, the $10 jump to $79.99 for some Switch 2 games, including Mario Kart World.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth pointing out that Nintendo is bundling Mario Kart World with a Nintendo Switch 2 for $499.99, cutting the cost of the game by a huge $30 in the process. However, Nintendo has indicated this bundle is a limited-time offer, and it remains to be seen if the bundle holds at $500, given the uncertainty surrounding the tariff situation and Nintendo’s pre-order delay in the U.S.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But Mario Kart World isn’t the only Nintendo Switch 2 game to cost $80 — some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nintendo-switch-2-will-improve-switch-1-games"><u>Switch 2 Edition games</u></a> announced during the Nintendo Direct also cost $79.99, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-star-crossed-world"><u>Kirby and The Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star Crossed World</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv"><u>Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition"><u>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has plenty of reaction to Nintendo’s jump to $80 for the Switch 2 generation, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive"><u>from analysts who have helped us understand why this has happened</u></a>. Now, Shawn Layden, who used to run PlayStation in the U.S., has offered his thoughts, pointing to the fear of missing out on Nintendo exclusives as justifying price hikes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on the <a href="https://youtu.be/pSu0BQFTFPA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayerDriven YouTube channel and podcast</a>, Layden highlighted the contrasting strategies of Sony and Microsoft, and Nintendo, where Sony and Microsoft are downplaying exclusive games as they move to PC and rival consoles, but Nintendo is keeping its games on its own consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But right here you see, ‘wow, that’s kind of a hefty price hike from Switch 1 to Switch 2 and, wow, 80 bucks for a game?’ " Layden said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But if it’s the only place where you can play Mario, then you get your wallet out and you buy into it... and Donkey Kong and Zelda. That first-party exclusivity kind of mitigates the sticker shock, if you will, of these price hikes, because you want that content so bad."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch 2 pricing in the U.S.:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nintendo Switch 2 by itself: $449.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 with Mario Kart World bundled in: $499.99</li><li>Mario Kart World by itself: $79.99</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza: $69.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller: $79.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Camera: $49.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Controller pair: $89.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip: $34.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Strap: $12.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Wheel pair: $19.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Set: $109.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case and Screen Protector: $34.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case: $79.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter: $29.99</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Layden also talked about the price of video games generally, which, he insisted, have actually gone down over the years when you take into account inflation. Layden said console manufacturers should have hiked the price of games by $5 with each new console generation so that they would cost around $90 now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In 2025 dollars, $59.99 in 1999 is equivalent to $100. Your purchasing power compared to your cost of living, it's much smaller now than it was before, but still companies have been reluctant to push that price up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was in it at the time — probably every generation they should have baked in a $5 software price hike, and make that the typical, 'well every generation it's another five bucks.' And you would have been up to $90 already by now."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, IGN published its interview with Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience, Bill Trinen, conducted at a recent Switch 2 preview event in New York, but before Nintendo announced the delay to pre-orders due to Trump’s tariffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the interview, Trinen insisted Mario Kart World justifies its $80 price tag, and pointed to the upcoming dedicated Mario Kart World Nintendo Direct where fans will learn more about the game and what it has to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would say it's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value?” Trinen said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Mario Kart World, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, but I did read your article this morning and I think you had mentioned that you didn’t find a lot to discover when roaming around. So I would say tune into our Mario Kart Direct to see what, maybe you'll be able to find out about that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also asked Trinen about the $80 cost of some of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games. While there is a $10 upgrade path for existing owners of these games on the Switch, and both The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition ($69.99) and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition ($79.99) are available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, Nintendo is not offering any sort of discount to newcomers on Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trinen’s answer here echoed his Mario Kart World response, pointing to the value Nintendo sees in its games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, 'what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?' " he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I would probably counter to some of that is that really what you're looking at is for the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, that's the physical price for somebody that has not bought the base game. For somebody who has bought Tears of the Kingdom or Breath of the Wild, the upgrade packs for those are $9.99. And if you happen to be a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack member, both of the Zelda upgrade packs are inclusive within that membership. So there's no additional charge for those.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what's the content, what's the value, and what's an appropriate price based on that.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the current $450 price tag of the Switch 2 itself, Trinen again pointed to value, but also highlighted the increasing costs associated with releasing a video game console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Obviously the cost of everything goes up over time, and I personally would love if the cost of things didn't go up over time,” he told IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But I think any time you're building a new system that's got new features and new tech, there's costs associated with that. So again, we look at what is the experience on Nintendo Switch? What's the experience on Nintendo Switch 2? What are the new features that it offers? And certainly there's the cost of goods and things that factor into that, but we try to find the right appropriate price for a product based on that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As IGN has reported, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-fear-impact-of-tariffs-on-switch-2-price-i-shouldnt-as-an-average-person-be-priced-out-of-this"><u>some Nintendo fans have expressed concern that they may be priced out of the next-generation</u></a> if the company goes even higher than the already controversial prices for the Switch 2 and its games such as Mario Kart World due to the tariff situation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It’s a game set to launch alongside the Switch 2 in June that offers a guided tour of the console itself in video game form.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour is described as a "virtual exhibition" of the new hardware. Per Nintendo: "through tech demos, minigames and other interactions, players will get to know the new system inside and out in ways they may never have known about otherwise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Direct showed footage of a small player avatar exploring a super-sized Switch 2, reading about the different features and facts about the console. It also includes mini-games such as Speed Golf, Dodge the Spiked Balls, and a Maracas Physics Demo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-will-be-a-paid-tour-of-your-new-nintendo-switch-2"><u>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</u></a> costs $9.99 and is a digital-only product.

As we know, this is a battle Fils-Aimé won to a degree, with Wii Sports bundled with the Wii everywhere except Japan.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The story of Wii Sports pack in ...<a href="https://t.co/LhflSFWaL3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/LhflSFWaL3</a></p>— Reggie Fils-Aimé (@Reggie) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reggie/status/1910052940242620563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The second interview clip Fils-Aimé tweeted pointed to a similar battle to bundle Wii Play with the Wii Remote. In the clip from our interview, Fils-Aimé revealed he “pissed off” Miyamoto once again with the suggestion. “He was not happy about that either.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, tweeting “and the results,” Fils-Aimé clipped out the section from our interview in which he reveals that all this was, ultimately, the right call.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the Americas and in Europe Wii Sports was packed in with the Wii proposition. It was not in Japan, which created a bit of a test market. It was obvious that in the markets where Wii Sports was packed in that we became much more of a phenomenon. Wii Sports itself became much more of a phenomenon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We did pack the Remote with Wii Play. And it became the fifth best-selling piece of software in the history of the Wii.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">And the results.<a href="https://t.co/xrFTDeJMQf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/xrFTDeJMQf</a></p>— Reggie Fils-Aimé (@Reggie) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reggie/status/1910052943690150239?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It’s clear to see what Fils-Aimé is doing here. Although he’s not directly commenting on Nintendo’s Switch 2 strategy, he is making the point that free pack-ins have worked in the past for Nintendo consoles,so it stands to reason that it would do so again for Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans know what’s up, too. “Hahaha, guys I think Reggie is watching our comments about the Switch 2,” said one X / Twitter user. “We know you would have packed in Welcome Tour,” said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, IGN published its interview with Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience, Bill Trinen, conducted at a recent Switch 2 preview event in New York, but before Nintendo announced the delay to pre-orders due to Trump’s tariffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trinen said there’s more to Welcome Tour than it appears based on the showing during the Nintendo Direct and even during recent hands-on opportunities the media had access to. Based on what’s actually in the game, Nintendo decided $9.99 “is not an exorbitant price,” he continued.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/10/reggie-1744265519979.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Reggie fought for Wii Sports as a Wii pack in.
