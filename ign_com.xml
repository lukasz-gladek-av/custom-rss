            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since its announcement, Mega Evolution's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-where-to-buy">Phantasmal Flames expansion</a> has ignited immediate interest across both competitive circles and the secondary market in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop"><u>Pokémon TCG</u></a>, and it’s stronger than ever with the launch of the full <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-release-full-release-schedule-2025">English set on November 14</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Mega Evolutions roaring back into prominence thanks to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a"><u>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</u></a>, and several cards offering unusually high ceiling damage or strong search power, the set has already produced an early hierarchy of valuable heavy-hitters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to marketplaces like <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7M0e8?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGPlayer</u></a>, certain cards have already skyrocketed further in price, and, following up from our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-cards-most-expensive-cards">Mega Evolution round-up</a>, we’ve ranked the ten most expensive cards so far in Phantasmal Flames.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From aggressive Mega attackers to powerful evolution support, Phantasmal Flames brings a fiery mix of competitive threats and high-demand pulls. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, Mega Lopunny ex offers top-tier tempo, Sharpedo ex delivers huge burst damage, and Dawn provides unmatched consistency for evolution decks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the set’s true centrepieces are the three Mega Charizard X ex prints: with all of them sporting the powerful Inferno X attack, and commanding serious prices.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Mega Lopunny ex – 115/094 (Ultra Rare)</h2><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230505"><div id="230505" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Lopunny ex - 115/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting off the list is the standard Ultra Rare print of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqRvgD?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Lopunny ex</a>, and along with its colourfuly imposing art, it's no surprise if this card ends up a hit in the  in the current format. Gale Thrust may begin at 60, but if Mega Lopunny moved from the Bench to the Active Spot that turn, it jumps to 230 damage, which is an excellent rate for a single Colourless attachment. It slots neatly into pivot-based lists utilising switching loops or mobility engines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Spiky Hopper hits for 160 and ignores all effects on the opponent’s Active Pokemon, granting a clean answer to walls and defensive techs. Low costs, high numbers, and flexible deck compatibility keep this card’s value comfortably afloat.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Piplup – 098/094 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230504"><div id="230504" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Piplup - 098/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Though <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVElnJ?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Piplup</a> is a non-ex Basic, it enters the list because Call for Support is one of the strongest turn-one stabilisers the set provides. Being able to search any Supporter directly from the deck without drawback improves the early consistency of almost any list that can afford to include it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This kind of tutoring power is frequently undervalued in pre-release environments but becomes highly prized once decks tighten up. Most importantly, though, its winter-themed art by Hideki Ishikawa  — showing a slightly sad and lonely Piplup under a cliff, is simply adorable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between its splashable typing and immediate effect on turn sequencing, Piplup’s competitive utility easily justifies its early demand.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Meowth – 106/094 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230503"><div id="230503" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Meowth 106/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meowth’s Fury Swipes attack is simple but mathematically solid for a Colourless Basic. At 20 damage per heads across three flips, <a href="https://zdcs.link/av3vE8?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Meowth</a> can occasionally push early pressure without requiring specific Energy types. In today’s meta, where some decks prefer low-investment starters that can chip for tempo, this puts Meowth on the radar as a flexible opener.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst not format-defining, cards that slot seamlessly into evolving or toolbox-style lists often find stable market interest, and the Illustration Rare for this Meowth with its mischievous-looking aesthetic is no exception.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Rotom ex – 126/094 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230502"><div id="230502" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Rotom ex - 126/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rotom ex stands out because of its Multi Adapter ability, which allows each of your Rotom-named Pokemon to hold two Pokemon Tools. That alone opens up unique strategies involving damage modifiers, switching aids, or defensive attachments,essentially doubling the efficiency of Tool-based engines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its attack, Thunderbolt, hits for a respectable 130 in exchange for discarding all Energy. While not remarkable on its own, it becomes meaningful in lists built to recycle Energy or continuously buff damage through stacked Tools. At around $43 at the time of writing, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwgNw?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rotom's</a> competitive ceiling explains why its value is climbing.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Mega Sharpedo ex – 127/094 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230501"><div id="230501" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Sharpedo ex - 127/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Sharpedo ex brings an unusually threatening combination of draw power and burst damage. Greedy Fang drawing two cards keeps your engine moving, but it’s Hungry Jaws that has truly caught players’ attention. Starting at 120 and climbing to 270 damage if Sharpedo has any damage counters, the attack synergises perfectly with self-damage enablers and predictable chip from switching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darkness decks love aggression, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjgWb?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Sharpedo ex</a> delivers it at an appealing rate, along with the artwork of this Special Illustration Rare being strikingly agrresive, too. It is already being viewed as a centrepiece for future archetypes, hence its high price.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Mega Lopunny ex – 128/094 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230500"><div id="230500" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Lopunny ex - 128/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdp1AM?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Lopunny ex</a> maintains the exact same competitive toolkit as the Ultra Rare but has surged further in value due to its importance in mobility-focused strategies, and its impactful illustration After all, the ability to consistently hit for 230 with a single Energy and a switch effect makes Lopunny one of the most Energy-efficient attackers in the set, but 5ban Graphics' artwork kicks this card up a notch,</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s along with Spiky Hopper giving Mega Lopunny a reliable second option when facing tankier builds. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Mega Charizard X ex – 109/094 (Ultra Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230499"><div id="230499" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Charizard X ex - 109/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With Inferno X, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDrxDZ?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Charizard X ex</a> enters the meta as one of the scariest late-game sweepers in the expansion. Discarding any number of Fire Energy from your Pokémon to deal 90 damage per Energy creates a game-ending threat once ramp engines or mid-game acceleration are online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fire decks are gaining traction again thanks to several new support options, and Charizard’s scaling damage allows it to remove even tanky ex Pokemon in a single strike. With the colourful pink and green background art by takuyoa, this can easily be one of the most-eyecatching cards in the set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultra Rare or not, the card’s destructive potential certainly commands a premium.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Dawn – 129/094 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230498"><div id="230498" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dawn - 129/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From a competitive standpoint, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8AYy?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dawn</a> is one of the best evolution-focused Supporters printed in recent sets, and her Special Illustration Rare is the best-looking way to add her to your deck. Fetching a Basic, a Stage 1, and a Stage 2 Pokémon all at once massively accelerates setup. Decks relying on multi-stage combos or heavy evolutions, particularly Megas, benefit enormously.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Simply put, Dawn cuts down the number of turns required to assemble full lines, dramatically improving consistency. Supporters with this level of deck-building impact rarely stay cheap for long.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Mega Charizard X ex – 130/094 (Mega Hyper Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230497"><div id="230497" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Charizard X ex - 130/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Identical in function to the other Charizard prints, the Mega Hyper Rare version retains the same brutally efficient Inferno X attack, but in a breathtaking golden presentation. The combination of universal Fire Energy support, high base HP, and late-game nuking potential makes <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmOgD5?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Charizard X ex</a> a central threat in Fire archetypes — but now, this card also looks like it belongs on a first place medal as well as a binder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that competitive players already expect the card to headline at least one top-tier deck, its market price reflects both power and scarcity.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Mega Charizard X ex – 125/094 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6d841594-dbc0-48d0-aeb0-19d35c65db65" id="230496"><div id="230496" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Charizard X ex - 125/094 - ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sitting comfortably at the top of Phantasmal Flames is the Special Illustration Rare version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/aADnZq?object_uuid=d9015d05-43ef-47e3-8bbe-3fa291f18346&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Charizard X ex</a>, and with good reason. In competitive terms, it shares the same terrifying damage ceiling as the other Charizard prints thanks to Inferno X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the visual presentation by takuyoa that takes this top-tier card further. The artwork depicts Mega Charizard X in a dramatic, full-scene composition: blue flames striking all-over, wings outstretched, and a mesmerising display of Charmander, Charmeleon, and base Charizard underneath.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a rare example of a Charizard card that captures both the ferocity and scale of the Mega form without overcrowding the frame. Combined with its very limited pull rate, this treatment has made it the definitive chase card of the set, a blend of raw competitive power and high-end collector appeal that few other cards can match.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Nov 17, 2025 4:00 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-phantasmal-flames-most-expensive-cards]]></content:encoded>
