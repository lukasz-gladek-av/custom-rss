By comparison, and according to data supplied by SteamDB, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lies-of-p"><u>Lies of P</u></a>'s highest concurrent peak is a little over 30,000 players, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen"><u>Lords of the Fallen</u></a> is 43,075 players, and <a href="https://v/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The First Berserker: Khazan</u></a> is just shy of 33,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concurrent players isn't the only metric we should use when measuring how successful a game is, of course, but it's a good starting point, even though it doesn't account for players on other platforms.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the launch-day success, however, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers originally released to 'overwhelming negative' user reviews on Steam but has since upgraded to 'mostly negative' as players report issues with "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198992555658/recommended/2277560/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>extremely awful performance</u></a>," a "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/wakeupneo/recommended/2277560/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>completely lifeless</u></a>" main character, and "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2277560/reviews/?browsefilter=toprated&amp;snr=1_5_100010_#scrollTop=5435.5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>clunky</u></a>" combat and gameplay. At the time of writing, just 21% of the 6,500+ reviews left on Steam are positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Wanted to give this game a good chance. I was excited for this. I had seen the mostly negative rating and checked the concerns and I can say now that as of this moment, they are correct," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2277560/reviews/?browsefilter=toprated&amp;snr=1_5_100010_#scrollTop=5435.5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a> one reviewer. "The game has some massive performance issues. I tried just playing because sometimes gameplay can more than make up for lacking in other areas. I was unfortunately not able to see much of the combat. I did fight the opening tutorial boss, I did fight through a few camps of enemies, and, at one point, during the boss fight, I was enjoying it and having fun. I was unable to experience more of that due to the overshadowing performance issues."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"UE5 games is [sic] a hit or miss when it comes to performance, and in this case it's a miss unfortunately (at least for my system)," added <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/onyotato/recommended/2277560/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another</u></a>. "This game needs a free demo for this exact reason."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not all bad, though. "I'm one of the lucky ones: the game runs fine on my machine. No crashes, no stutters, no slideshow combat," said a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198382696571/recommended/2277560/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>happier</u></a> reviewer. "And that makes one thing crystal clear — Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is being unfairly crucified by players with garbage PCs and zero optimization knowledge."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is a Soulslike action-RPG set in the land of Shu during the dark and tumultuous late Ming Dynasty. You play as a mysterious warrior afflicted by a horrific feather disease, who uncovers hidden secrets and battles supernatural enemies in an ancient empire teetering on the edge of collapse. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is yet another great Soulslike to add to the ever-increasing pile, featuring excellent combat, wonderful level design, an incredible skill tree, and fearsome bosses," IGN wrote in our  <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers review</a>, which returned an 8/10 score. "Just watch out for some steep difficulty dips and spikes, and a reliance on cheap-feeling 'gotcha!' ambushes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers released earlier today, July 24, 2025, for PS5, Xbox Series, and PC via Steam and Epic Games Store. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-picks-up-wuchang-fallen-feathers-for-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch"><u>Microsoft has also brought it to Game Pass day one</u></a> for those subscribed to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/xbox-game-pass"><u>Ultimate tier</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lollipop-chainsaw">Lollipop Chainsaw</a> is getting a sequel and anime spin-off, more than a decade after the original launched. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new video game is being developed by Dragami Games, successor to the original's Kadokawa Games, which launched remaster project <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lollipop-chainsaw-repop">Lollipop Chainsaw RePop</a> last year for PC and consoles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lollipop Chainsaw won over a cult audience back in 2012 for its cheerleader-starring undead-slicing hack-and-slash gameplay. Notably, the project was directed by No More Heroes' Suda51, and written at least in part by James Gunn. Yes, <em>that </em>James Gunn — long before his days making <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/superman-2025">Superman</a> and running the DCU, and still a couple of years before the first Guardians of the Galaxy.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's press release states that the franchise has so far shifted 1.5 million units, though the vast majority of these — at least 1.24 million — are sales for the original game, rather than its recent remaster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That remaster drew something of a mixed response, as it lacked the original game's licensed music soundtrack and arrived later than expected — after Dragami switched from its original plans to fully remake the game. This initial idea was ditched, purportedly after fans said they were keen to play a remastered version of Lollipop Chainsaw as close to the original as possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's announcement of a sequel again makes mention of a desire to develop a second game that was in line with fan wishes. There's also mention that "key staff members" who worked on the original game were back for the sequel, though no mention, as expected, of any involvement by Suda51. Or James Gunn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Under the strong partnership between Nada Holdings and Dragami Games, development is already underway on a brand-new Lollipop Chainsaw title that both preserves and builds upon the appeal of the original," today's announcement reads. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With a firm commitment to honoring the spirit of the original work, the development team includes key staff members who were involved in the previous title. The new project is also being developed with close attention to fan feedback."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement then concludes with this — an oddly-worded affirmation that the sequel will continue the "distinctive tone" of the original and not tone it down due to "DEI". Is this a reference to Suda51's most recent No More Heroes letting Travis Touchdown wear a "F**k Racism" hoodie, or something to do with James Gunn's Superman, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-gunns-superman-immigrant-comment-was-a-mistake-that-could-hurt-the-films-box-office-former-superman-actor-dean-cain-says">which seems to have upset Fox News</a>? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or, perhaps, it's simply a suggestion that fans of the original's skimpy cheerleader costumes won't leave empty-handed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As with the original, the new title aims to recreate a world rich in dark humor," the announcement concludes. "The development process will prioritize staying true to the distinctive tone and spirit of the original work, without imposing excessive creative restrictions in the name of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no word yet on when Lollipop Chainsaw 2 will launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
