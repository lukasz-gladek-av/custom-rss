The expansion plays with more Trainer Pokémon cards, including Ethan, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-gold-version">Pokémon Gold</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-silver-version">Silver</a> protagonist, and brought back more nostalgia than I could cope with. It feels like exactly what Pokémon TCG needed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-destined-rivals-launch-ran-into-the-same-old-issues-with-scalpers-shortages-and-outages">Destined Rivals</a> is more than just a trip down memory lane. It is a real evolution for the game. From the way the new Trainer’s Pokémon open up deck-building possibilities to the much better pull rates, this set feels like they finally figured out what collectors and players want again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It could be deemed as a mighty fresh start for The Pokémon Company, after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pokmon-company-addresses-tcg-shortages-and-scalpers-following-destined-rivals-launch-in-new-statement">months of stock issues</a> and sets with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review">tough pull rates</a> (although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">Journey Together</a> had initially started getting things moving in the right direction). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I am already planning which decks to build and which cards I want doubles (or triples) of, and I haven't felt this way about a set in a while. And if stock levels can finally get sorted this year, alongside the whole of TCG, I think most trainers will have a very hard time resisting this set.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Destined Rivals is more than just a trip down memory lane..."</p></div><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to Buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QdbN61?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Booster Bundle<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBglGE?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Booster Box<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJGom?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Elite Trainer Box<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbeAq?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pokemon Center Elite Trainer Box (Exclusive)<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/akKJrr?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Half Booster Box<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXrBd?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Booster Pack<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/985JDq?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sleeved Booster Pack<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgqRD?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3 Pack Blister [Zebstrika]<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8YmZ?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3 Pack Blister [Kangaskhan]<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/91jLoR?object_uuid=42384c37-3c5e-4be4-a76e-fc7a255ec95f&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Build &amp; Battle Box<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p id="unboxing-and-impressions"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Unboxing and Impressions">Unboxing and Impressions</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I got my hands on a nice selection of <a href="https://pk.ign.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/237012/gallery/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-destined-rivals-pokemon-center-elite-trainer-box-images" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Destined Rivals</a> products thanks to The Pokémon Company: a Build and Battle Box, a Booster Bundle, an Elite Trainer Box, and a full Booster Box. I want to say upfront that opening all of these felt way more rewarding than the past few sets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every product had its highlights, and it genuinely felt like I was hitting cards worth getting excited about instead of just shrugging and moving on.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Destined Rivals: Build and Battle Box</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Build and Battle Box set the tone early. Inside were four booster packs, a stamped promo card (Team Rocket's Tyrainitar for me) and a 40-card deck. I pulled one ex card and one Illustration Rare from the four packs, which is half decent if you ask me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Building a quick deck from the included cards was surprisingly fun, especially since the Trainer’s Pokémon mechanics made even the starter deck feel a lot more flavorful than usual. Four Team Rocket's Tyranitar holo's please!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Destined Rivals: Elite Trainer Box</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly I didn't pull much from the Elite Trainer Box. But I did get nine booster packs, sleeves, dice, markers, and the Rocket’s Wobbuffet promo card. This ETB looks so awesome in my opinion. The red-and-black Team Rocket design is even better in person. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this ETB is easily one of the strongest ones we have seen recently, although like any Pokémon TCG set, pulling chase cards is 50% luck and 50% based on being a good set. So I was unlucky.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Destined Rivals: Booster Bundle</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But the Booster Bundle kept the momentum going. With six booster packs and no extras, it was just me versus the Pokégods. I pulled a couple of ex's and my favorite card of this set, Ethan's Typhlosian IR. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What a stunning card, so much movement and detail that still manages to showcase the bond between Ethan and Tyranitar. I think Booster Bundles are one of the best value products if you want a quick hit of that fresh-set excitement without destroying your wallet.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Destined Rivals: Booster Box</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Booster Box was the grand finale, and it delivered exactly what I was hoping for. I pulled multiple ex cards, a Gold card, a SIR and several Illustration Rares that made the whole opening feel exciting from start to finish. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, this was the perfect reminder that Booster Boxes can still feel like an event, not just a slog through 36 packs hoping for one decent hit. If I was to get one of these products again, I'd go all in on a booster box.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"...It's safe to say that this is one of the best times I have had opening cards in ages." </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>But what about my first impressions with the new expansion?</strong> Well the thing that jumps out for me about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-destined-rivals-preorder-guide-2025">Destined Rivals</a> is how much better the illustrations are. Cards just feel more alive now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even commons are expressive enough that I find myself looking at them instead of instantly shuffling them into the bulk pile. It is the kind of small but powerful change that makes every pack a little adventure instead of a chore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The return of Trainer’s Pokémon for a second time in the Scarlet and Violet era is another huge shift that I want to shout about. Building decks and collecting cards based around specific characters instead of just types gives near-unlimited theme options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I love that Cynthia’s Pokémon feel like a cohesive team instead of a random pile of cards. It makes building and battling way more fun, and it also makes each pull feel a lot more personal.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Destined Rivals: Top Card Pulls</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pull rates feel a lot better too. From 46 packs, I pulled 8 ex cards, 6 Illustration Rares, 1 Special Illustration Rare, and 1 Gold card. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's 16 respectable hits that don't just feel like glorified reverse holo cards. It matches the strong pull experience from Journey Together, and it is a world away from the frustrating experience I had with recent mini sets like Prismatic Evolutions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I still have nightmares about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-shrouded-fable-preview">Shrouded Fable</a>, where the pull rates were so harsh that opening it felt like a social experiment on patience. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a> was only slightly better. Even after opening a booster box, it mostly handed out standard ex cards like consolation prizes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-where-to-buy-in-stock">Prismatic Evolutions</a>? That mini set was so flooded with Pokéball cards and low chances that I felt quite disappointed after previewing it. <a href="https://nordic.ign.com/pokemon/92538/news/pokemon-tcg-announces-destined-rivals-set-with-nostalgic-team-rocket-theme" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Destined Rivals</a> fixes all of that and reminds me why I love this hobby.</p><p id="best-card-pulls"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Card Pulls">My Favorite Destined Rivals Pulls</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of pure chase cards I pulled alone, this is one of my favorite Pokémon TCG previews to date. I got 16 hits from standard exs and IRs to SIRs, with the full gallery at the top of the article. Here's my top five pulls from this Destined Rivals preview, and I think I've caught some of the best cards in this set:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ethan's Ho-Oh ex 239/182</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/ethans-ho-oh-ex-gold-rare-1747136504522.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Special Illustration Rare artwork shows Ethan and Ho-Oh soaring across a vivid sunset, and it's just one of those cards that feels special the second you see it. Whilst that was one of my chase cards I wanted to pull going in, I'm just as happy with it's gold rare variant. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has Ho-Oh and Ethan front and center, plus my generation two choice was Pokémon Gold, so this card has a lot of meaning to me. The card itself is very playable, allowed you to attach two basic fire energy per turn whilst causing 160 damage and healing 50 damage from each of your Pokémon. A Ho-Oh ex and Charizard ex deck would be a beast!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Arven's Mabosstiff ex 235/182</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/arvens-mabosstiff-ex-sir-1747136924945.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Arven’s Mabosstiff ex is a card that makes me love midrange decks again. Just look at how much of a good boy he is. This artwork captures everything I love about Pokémon, and also reminds me of having a good cuddle with my doggos. Epic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vigorous Tackle gives you solid damage early, and Boss’s Headbutt lets you turn a battle around for a massive 210 damage. With Arven’s Sandwich keeping it healthy, I think this card could be a real pain for opponents who think they can chip you down easily. I will call this deck "Mabos-switch" and you don't have enough badges to train me.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Team Rocket's Crobat ex 217/182</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/team-rockets-crobat-ex-full-art-1747137011418.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This card has so much potential for a damage spread deck. Imagine sending Crobat ex in, placing damage on three opposing Pokémon in one turn, then sending in something like Shrouded Fable's Bloodmoon Ursaluna from your hand. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That would then allow you to use it's Battle Hardened ability to attach three fighting energy in one turn and use it's Mad Bite attack. It does 100 damage plus 30 more for each damage counter. Insane deck idea! I also like these full art ex cards with a trainer in the background, such a unique design. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ethan's Typhlosion 190/182</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/ethans-typlosion-ir-1747137123227.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ethan’s Typhlosion brings the heat, literally. Buddy Blast can do massive damage based on how many Ethan’s Adventure cards you have in your discard pile, and it rewards aggressive, discard-heavy playstyles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This IR card is my favorite card of Destined Rivals. It does such an amazing job of showing the connection Ethan has to his starter Pokémon whilst showing how hectic this moment is. Such an awesome card.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Team Rocket's Houndoom 191/182</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/team-rockets-houndoom-ir-1747137164397.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Houndoom needs more love, and it got it with this illustration rare. This is one of those Pokémon that was made for a Team Rocket set. This artwork is another example of how active and agressive Destined Rivals artwork is, and also a fantastic example of how undervalued Illustration Rares are in Pokémon TCG. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's me hoping Black Bolt and White Flare turns heads with every card having an illustration variant. I'm not sure if I'd use this card in play due to the energy discard being there on a Stage 1 card, but it would be easy enough to build up on your bench for a quick hit and retreat.</p><p id="verdict"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Verdict">Should You Buy Pokémon TCG: Destined Rivals?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think Destined Rivals is a must-buy <strong>(with a massive caveat: if you can actually find it in stock)</strong>. It brings back the thrill of opening packs, makes deckbuilding more exciting, and gives us some of the best-looking cards Pokémon has produced in the Scarlet and Violet era. (Which is really saying something). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think collectors, competitive players, and anyone who just wants a fun opening experience are going to find a lot to love here. <strong>Just be warned: your wallet might start plotting its own Team Rocket-level revenge.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
