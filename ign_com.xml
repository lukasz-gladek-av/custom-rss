Published by Amazon Game Studios, it's set to release in 2027 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is a reimagining of the original Tomb Raider game, built with Unreal Engine 5 and due out next year. Both games will feature a new actor as Lara Croft: Alix Wilton Regan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the news was a surprise for some, actor Camilla Luddington — who portrayed Lara Croft in the 2013-2018 reboot trilogy — shared a bittersweet Instagram post about her time as the lead, saying she loved the fans and Croft will "forever be a part of [her]."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I thought I’d make a post since I’ve been hearing from so many of you," she wrote. "I want to let you know that I have loved this fandom. To join the list of Lara Crofts before me was an incredible honor and she will forever be a part of me. The Survivor Trilogy was a decade of adventure I will never ever forget. I could not be prouder of what we created.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And as always, a new actress receives this incredible gift to step into the boots. So with that said — [new Croft actor Alix Wilton Regan] if you’re ever in need of a [bow and arrow], I know the exact spot to look for one at Croft Manor."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alix Wilton Regan has played a number of big video game characters over the years, including the Female Inquisitor in both Dragon Age: Inquisition and Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Samantha Traynor in Mass Effect 3, Alt Cunningham in Cyberpunk 2077, and Aya in Assassin's Creed Origins. Regan was set to play Joanna Dark in Microsoft's Perfect Dark reboot, but it was canceled as part of a major round of layoffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-actress-camilla-luddington-bids-farewell-to-tomb-raider-as-alix-wilton-regan-teases-were-just-getting-started" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Eurogamer</u></a>, Regan also <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSKc_PVEX6y/?igsh=MWZmank3c2NkNGx2bw%3D%3D" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>shared a post</u></a> following The Game Awards announcement, claiming it was the "absolute highlight" of her career to date to have been cast, "surpass[ing] even my wildest dreams, quite frankly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're. Just. Getting. Started," she wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb on Tomb Raider: Catalyst:</p><blockquote>Tomb Raider: Catalyst, which has been in development by Crystal Dynamics since the partnership with Amazon Game Studios was announced in 2022, marks a bold direction for the series as Lara Croft embarks on a new adventure across Northern India. Tomb Raider: Catalyst is set in the wake of a mythical cataclysm that has unleashed ancient secrets and awakened the mysterious forces that guard them. When the most notorious treasure hunters from around the world descend on the region, Lara races to uncover the truth buried beneath the fractured landscape and stop those who would use its power for their own gain. As the ancient world collides with the present, Lara must decide who to trust among rivals and allies to prevent a catastrophe and protect a secret that could reshape the future.<br>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, Tomb Raider: Catalyst delivers the largest Tomb Raider world yet where Lara will traverse a landscape full of secrets, delve into lost tombs packed with intricate puzzles, and solve ancient mysteries using her unmatched brilliance and richly customized adventure tech. Perfect for longtime fans and newcomers alike, players will experience an exhilarating story of trust and betrayal that tests Lara Croft in new ways. Tomb Raider: Catalyst is set to launch in 2027 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Catalyst wasn’t the only Tomb Raider-related announcement at this year’s Game Awards. Catalyst’s first trailer was immediately followed by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-catalyst-announced-for-2027-and-tomb-raider-1-reimagining-announced-for-2026-the-game-awards-2025"><u>a surprise announcement</u></a> of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis"><u>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</u></a>, a “reimagining” of the original 1996 classic. It is due out for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S sometime in 2026, as that’s when the franchise celebrates its 30th anniversary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb on Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis:</p><blockquote>In a surprise announcement, Amazon Game Studios, Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog unveiled Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, a modern reimagining of Lara Croft's genre-defining 1996 debut. Developed in partnership between Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog, the game features stunning visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5, modern game design, and new surprises that honor the spirit and atmosphere of the original game. As Lara Croft, players will harness their wits and athleticism to explore exotic locations lost to time, traverse treacherous landscapes, solve deadly contraptions, and face lethal predators in their quest for the scattered pieces of the Scion — an artifact of immeasurable power.</blockquote><blockquote>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis sets a new standard for re-envisioning a classic by masterfully balancing innovation with gaming heritage, capturing the wonder and excitement that defined a genre while igniting a new sense of discovery through expanded storytelling. The game arrives in 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced"><u>everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</u></a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list"><u>the winners list in full</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It's the burning question.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian publishing director Michael Douse has explained the studio’s thinking in the wake of the gruesome reveal trailer for Divinity, the Baldur’s Gate 3 studio’s next big role-playing game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divinity">Divinity</a> was announced at The Game Awards with a CG trailer that features extreme gore and sex. It begins with medieval fantasy villagers preparing for a ritual sacrifice, which involves burning a man alive. The villagers celebrate the occasion by playing music and dancing, laughing and chatting, feasting and drinking. At one point, someone throws up into animal feed. A mother and child look on with anticipation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The burning of the man begins, and here things get very gory indeed. As his flesh tears and he screams in pain, some of the villagers are seen having sex. Others whip themselves. There’s more vomiting. Everyone seems thrilled, but as the burning man dies, something goes horribly wrong.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Disgusting wounds appear on the man. As his arm rips off we get a quick cut to an extreme closeup of someone eating meat. More sex. More vomiting. More pigs eating the vomit. And then the burning man explodes in a shower of gore. Something terrible is pouring out of his body. This, clearly, is not what was supposed to happen, and the villagers flee in terror. In the aftermath we see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yup-that-weird-statue-was-teasing-a-new-divinity-game-the-game-awards-2025">the statue Geoff Keighley has teased ahead of The Game Awards itself</a>. It has not gone well for the villagers, but the pigs look like they're still having a good time mopping up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say the trailer has sparked a great deal of debate. While some have praised the studio for not holding back when it comes to its dark themes (something Baldur’s Gate 3 won plaudits for), others have said the trailer goes too far. Indeed some have accused Larian of "pushing the morale line" with the trailer, labeling it “gore porn.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Douse has explained what Larian was going for here. In a <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2000000527409807405" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet response</a> to illustrator and YouTuber Kala Elizabeth, who had praised the studio for refusing to “hold back or sanitize stories to make them more palatable,” Douse said the Divinity trailer wasn’t about shocking the audience, rather “treating the audience with a level of intellectual respect.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The phrase ‘treating the audience with a level of intellectual respect’ came up a lot in planning,” he said. “It isn’t about trying to shock them, it's about trying to match their powers of comprehension so that it resonates. We know people are capable of appreciating a three dimensional world.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Divinity Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This appears to have gone down well with Larian's fans. "I love this," Elizabeth replied. "As someone who plays durge, evil and renegade options I'm sad that more games don't seem to push that nuance and trust the audience anymore. Can't wait to see what y'all do next."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s still a great deal we don’t know about Divinity, of course, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-think-they-know-who-the-burning-man-in-the-divinity-trailer-is-supposed-to-be">fans think they’ve worked out who the burning man in the trailer is supposed to be</a>. Larian has said Divinity is its next “major” game after Baldur’s Gate 3, and it is set in the world of Rivellon. Here’s the tagline: “the gods are silent. Rivellon bleeds. New powers stir.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Built by the team who brought you Baldur's Gate 3, Larian Studios unchains its ambitions to bring you an RPG with greater breadth and depth than ever before,” reads the official blurb.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Divinity is a brand new game that doesn’t require experience with previous Larian titles, those who’ve played Divinity: Original Sin and Divinity: Original Sin 2 will be able to enjoy “greater understanding and continuity,” Larian added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Swen Vincke, founder and game director of Larian Studios, said: “Despite our long history with the series, this is our first game entitled Divinity. We’re ready to bring everything we’ve done previously into one place. This marks the beginning of something with more breadth, depth, and intimacy than anything we’ve created before. We’ve been building toward this moment ever since we took our fate into our own hands. This is the Divinity we’ve always wanted to make and you're going to have loads of fun with it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.
