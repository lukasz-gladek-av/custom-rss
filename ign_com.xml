We have reached out to EA for more details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioWare's decision not to release a DLC expansion may come as a surprise given its history with Mass Effect, Dragon Age, and Baldur's Gate 2. DLC episodes like Mass Effect 2's Lair of the Shadowbroker, the Dragon Age 2 prequel Leliana's Song, and the aforementioned Trespasser include some of BioWare's best-loved stories, offering a deeper look at their worlds and characters. But having finally finished its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade">decade-long journey with The Veilguard</a>, BioWare seems ready to focus its attention on Mass Effect, which has been largely on hold due to the studio focusing all of its efforts on shipping Dragon Age.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Modern RPGs</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, fans are busy digging into BioWare's latest RPG after Dragon Age's release on Thursday, propelling it to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-launch-beats-jedi-survivor-to-makes-it-eas-biggest-ever-single-player-game-on-steam">new highs for an EA game on Steam</a>.

In each week of November, Fortnite will have a waterfall rollout of new map locations "revamped" by the artists, culminating in a finale event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chapter 2 Remix was revealed alongside a surprise billboard takeover of Times Square in New York City on Friday night with performances from Ice Spice and Snoop Dogg. (Ice Spice played "Princess Diana," and Snoop Dogg did "Who Am I (What's My Name)?", "Gorgeous," "Drop It Like It's Hot," and "The Next Episode.") The concert was also livestreamed simultaneously on Fortnite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Week 1 will have Snoop Dogg's touch, remixing the point of interest formerly known as The Agency as The Dogg Pound. It will also bring back the boogie bomb that triggers "Drop It Like It's Hot." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The in-game compound was at least partially inspired by his actual 30+ room compound – converted from a warehouse 10 years ago – located nearby the Los Angeles International Airport, his son Cordell Broadus told press after the event. "[There's a] casino, green room, basketball court, club... He's super creative in the physical world so we wanted to create that in the digital landscape as well," said Broadus, who started the studio Death Row Games with his dad in 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I just wanted the whole feel of my world being brought into Fortnite," Snoop Dogg added.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/01/snoop-fortnite-1730501683298.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Snoop and company are coming to Fortnite. Image source: Epic Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Week 2 will reveal Eminem's takeover of The Grotto as Spaghetti Grotto (a play on his Mom's Spaghetti restaurant in Detroit) with a "Rap God" machine gun that spits out lyrics to the 2013 song. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Week 3 drops Ice Spice's Y2K, New York-inspired Shark Island. Finally, Week 4 will pay homage to Juice WLRD, who <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/12/how-did-juice-wlrd-die-cause-of-juice-wrlds-death.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">died in 2021</a> at just 21 years old. Epic says it worked closely with his mother, estate, and label, Interscope to bring this to life. "Jarad always loved to play Fortnite – it was more than just entertainment for him, it was a way to connect with others,” his mother, Carmela Wallace, said in a statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new season will launch in three phases: on November 1, with The Prelude; on November 2, with the offical launch of Chapter 2, and on November 30, with The Finale, which will be a yet-to-be-announced in-game event. Any players who attend, however, will receive a free cel-shaded outfit. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're starting to see artists understand that gaming is an interesting and important place to meet fans where they are," said Nate Nanzer, VP of Global Partnerships, at a press event before the concert. "There's a lot of experimentation bringing music and gaming closer together." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Emily Levy, the director of strategic partnerships, said that artists see an 8.7% lift of consumption on streaming platforms after bringing music into the game. "Fortnite has become a necessary stop for artists on their tours, to engage on their campaigns and release cycles," she said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same event, Fortnite also announced kicks, a new cosmetic item; players will now be able to pick cusom shoes for their avatars to wear. The first will be a classic pair of Air Jordan high tops. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Leanna Butkovic is IGN's Editorial Project Manager.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

While the franchise’s next major entry, Wilds, will surely be no different when it launches early next year, those who hopped into its pre-release beta yesterday are finding that its monsters don’t look quite as they expected. Specifically, many creatures currently sport low-poly models that make them look like they just hopped straight of a PS1 game.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Wilds beta seems to be struggling with its polygons</p><p>Here's a thread of any comically low-poly <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MHWilds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MHWilds</a> images I come across that are too funny to ignore🧵:</p><p>Feel free to drop your own low-poly encounters</p><p>Starting off with a low poly Seikret <a href="https://t.co/ilbAUb7cet" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ilbAUb7cet</a></p></div>— TeaCommonShark (@khitwins) <a href="https://twitter.com/khitwins/status/1852264130734100559?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear what exactly is causing these low-poly monsters to infest the Monster Hunter Wilds beta, but it appears that PC players are being affected the most. While an issue as widespread as this would be a concern for players who just picked up a finished game, there are those who can’t help but find the fun in this visual glitch during this pre-launch test. Many, including X/Twitter user @khitwins, have taken the opportunity to collect their findings in <a href="https://x.com/khitwins/status/1852264130734100559" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a thread of posts</u></a> while asking others to do the same.

This is the third patch to arrive since last weekend’s release and adds a host of tweaks and fixes for glitches big and small. Although the update largely focuses on Multiplayer and Zombies, it also includes a trio of universal touch-ups, including the removal of that pesky black screen glitch that has bothered players when trying to load into a match.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/codblops6-1725926226920.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 update brings fixes for Multiplayer and Zombies.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6 Multiplayer adjustments include the removal of Lowtown from the Infected map pool while adding the same mode to Private Match’s list of available modes. Players will now find that the Shotgun Slug attachment deals the correct amount of damage, too. Stability improvements have also arrived to address hiccups revolving around the UAV Scorestreak, Infected medals, and the Vigilance Perk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s typical for some players to take advantage of map exploits shortly after launch, and it’s also typical for the team at Activision to move quickly when squashing these exploits. Today’s update is no different, as it comes with a few patched exploits in the Zombies mode. Specifically, enjoyers of the round-based game mode will no longer be able to re-activate timed GobbleGums for extra use. Additionally, the Tactical Raft can no longer be used to block zombie paths on Terminus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6 launched last Friday and has already positioned itself as one of the most successful Call of Duty games of all time. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the release was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record"><u>the series’ biggest launch ever</u></a> earlier this week. Call of Duty GM Matt Cox added, “Black Ops 6 is an amazing game, and the response from the Call of Duty community has been incredible. This is only the beginning.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the launch of the updated Nuketown map today, players can expect to dive into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-gets-nuketown-this-week-as-activision-reveals-season-1-plans"><u>Black Ops 6 Season 1 when it launches November 14</u></a>.

As for the entry’s single-player offering, we gave it a 9/10, saying, “An excellent string of missions that offer variety and flexibility come together to make Black Ops 6 the best Call of Duty campaign in many, many years.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see the full patch notes from today’s update below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 November 1, 2024 Patch Notes</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">GLOBAL</h3>Stability <ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed an issue where some players may encounter a black screen when loading into a public or private match for both Multiplayer and Zombies. </li></ul>Settings <ul data-cy="list"><li>Resolved an issue when trying to select DLSS or DLAA in the upscaling options. </li></ul>UI <ul data-cy="list"><li>Resolved an issue with the unlock notification for Diamond Mastery Badges.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">MULTIPLAYER</h3>Maps<ul data-cy="list"><li>Removed Lowtown from Infected map pool.</li></ul>Modes <ul data-cy="list"><li>Added Infected to Private Match mode select. </li><li>Resolved an issue in Free-For-All where scoring was based on total score rather than the number of elimination points.  </li><li>Resolved an issue in Search and Destroy where players could slide too far while defusing or planting the bomb. </li></ul>Weapons <ul data-cy="list"><li>Resolved an issue with the Slug attachment on Shotguns dealing incorrect damage. </li></ul>Progression <ul data-cy="list"><li>Resolved an issue where challenges requiring Dive Kills were not awarded properly.</li></ul>Stability <ul data-cy="list"><li>Resolved an issue with stability when using the UAV. </li><li>Resolved an issue with stability in Infected when earning medals. </li><li>Resolved an issue with stability when using the Vigilance perk.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">ZOMBIES</h3>Gameplay <ul data-cy="list"><li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to re-activate timed GobbleGums. </li></ul>Enemies <ul data-cy="list"><li>Specials and Elites killed by scorestreaks will no longer drop items. </li></ul>Terminus <ul data-cy="list"><li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to block zombie pathing with the Tactical Raft. </li></ul>Liberty Falls <ul data-cy="list"><li>Resolved an issue that prevented Scorestreaks from being used after completing the Main Quest. </li><li>Resolved an issue that would leave the player in spectator mode when dying after completing the Main Quest. </li></ul>Stability <ul data-cy="list"><li>Resolved an issue with stability when changing field upgrades. </li><li>Added various server-side stability fixes. </li></ul>UI <ul data-cy="list"><li>Adjusted round UI limit to 999 from 256. </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
