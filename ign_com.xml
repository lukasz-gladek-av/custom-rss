This, unfortunately, resulted in false bans, although NetEase failed to say how many.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe sincerely apologize for this situation and want to assure you that we do not and will not ban players who are playing fairly and without cheating,‚Äù NetEase said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer said it had made a list of affected players and lifted their bans. ‚ÄúWe have identified the specific reasons behind these false bans and have compiled a list of affected players,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúWe have lifted these bans and want to express our heartfelt apologies for the inconvenience this has caused.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase went on to insist it is investing in improving its anti-cheat, and called on players to report cheaters if they encounter them. Here‚Äôs the rest of the statement in full:</p><blockquote>Our mission is to provide all players with a fair, just, and enjoyable gaming environment. Therefore, preventing and identifying cheaters is one of our top priorities. We have invested significant manpower and resources to improve the speed and accuracy of our detection systems. With any ongoing detection system, there is always room for improvement. We appreciate your assistance in helping us tackle this challenge. If you encounter any cheating behavior, please report it immediately; our reporting system will respond promptly. If you believe you have been wrongly banned, you can appeal to our customer support team, and we will review your case and respond in a timely manner. You can reach the support team via either in-game or in Discord!</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you for your understanding and support! </blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The news comes ahead of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fantastic-four-confirmed-for-marvel-rivals-in-official-first-look-image">Marvel Rivals Season 1 and the arrival of Fantastic Four playable characters</a>, teased with a first-look image and set for a trailer of their own next week.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/02/mr-main-1735838601458.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fantastic Four are coming to Marvel Rivals.

The free-to-play superhero team-based PvP shooter launched on December 6 across PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, and while Sony and Microsoft do not make player numbers public, Steam makes Valve stats available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, Marvel Rivals peaked over its launch weekend with 480,990 concurrent players, which was enough to put it in the top five most-played games on Valve's platform. It‚Äôs the 20th highest concurrent player number ever seen on Steam, ahead of the likes of Helldivers 2, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Destiny 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals launched with Season 0, with Season 1 set for January 9 according to the in-game battle pass countdown timer.

At the time the handheld was called the Atari Gamestation Portable and was due out during the fourth quarter of 2024 priced $149. This earlier version came with the Atari Trak-Ball, Paddle, and Keypad controllers, and we can see a refined design for these in the GameStation Go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Atari Trak-Ball is commonly used with arcade classics Centipede and Missile Command, with the Paddle used for the likes of Breakout. Atari games such as Brain Games and Codebreaker use the Keypad. The My Arcade logo is on the bottom of the device, which confirms the maker of the product under official license from Atari.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You'd expect the Gamestation Go to play a long list of retro games bolstered by Atari's recent aquisition of the Intellivision brand and certain games from Intellivision Entertainment LLC. The purchase included the rights to more than 200 titles from the Intellivision portfolio and the Intellivision trademarks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That‚Äôs all we have for now. Expect more when CES 2025 kicks off from January 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
