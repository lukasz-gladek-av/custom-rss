            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-early-black-friday-tv-deals-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In prior years <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> used to be a small window of five days between Thanksgiving Day and Cyber Monday and it would make sense to halt all of your shopping until that time arrived. That's just not true anymore. Retailers are stretching out this sale event across all of November so that some of the best deals can happen weeks in advance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Several retailers are advertising early Black Friday deals on TVs. However, I've only listed the TVs that I think are worth picking up right now. In other words, I don't think they will drop in price any further and they will remain competitive with the best deals we'll find on Black Friday. If there's a TV deal that isn't mentioned here, chances are I think you should wait and see if a better deal will pop up. After all, Black Friday is only a few weeks away. If you're just window shopping and want to hold off on your purchases no matter what, at least keep these deals bookmarked in case they do happen to be the best deals, even on Black Friday proper.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">65" Samsung S90C 4K OLED Smart TV for $999.99</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>The Best Black Friday</strong> <strong>High-End TV Deal</strong></h3><div catalogid="fbf0cb98-59c9-47d2-99dc-d304ac293783" id="203712"><div id="203712" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>65" Samsung S90C 4K OLED Smart TV</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Bonus $50 Best Buy gift card if purchased from Samsung.com</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Potentially the best Black Friday deal on a high-end OLED gaming TV is already available. Right now, <a href="https://howl.link/gah73kv6sjn96" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9lwdBx?object_uuid=2d0a77a8-2014-4f36-8e6c-0ddb4712d14c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>, and <a href="https://howl.link/icf9u7qwlfi6q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a> are offering the 65" Samsung S90C 4K OLED Smart TV for just $999.99 after an absolutely massive $1,600 price drop. This is an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">excellent TV to pair up with your PlayStation 5</a> or Xbox Series X. In fact, some critics rate the S90C as a better <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">gaming TV</a> than the LG C4. <a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/samsung/s90c-oled" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RTINGS</a> writes that "the LG (C4) is noticeably dimmer in Game Mode while the Samsung (S90C) isn't, making the Samsung the better choice for gamers."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">50" Hisense R6 4K Roku Smart TV for $138</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>The Best Black Friday Budget TV Deal</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="2fcb4533-ba98-4f0c-a266-361d9e3342e1" id="175979"><div id="175979" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>50" Hisense R6 4K Roku Smart TV</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For all you <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-budget-tv">budget TV shoppers</a>, one of the best TV deals of 2024 is now live. As part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-walmart-early-black-friday-deals-2024">Walmart's Early Black Friday Sale</a>, Walmart is currently offering the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWdjWA?object_uuid=2d0a77a8-2014-4f36-8e6c-0ddb4712d14c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">50" Hisense R6 4K Roku TV</a> for just $138. That's the best price we've seen for a 50" TV with native 4K resolution and a built-in Roku smart TV interface. The Hisense 50R6030N is a new 2024 model. This TV offers pretty much everything you really need at an unbeatable price. There will absolutely be plenty more TVs on sale during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday,</a> and if you're looking for a different screen size or a specific feature, then you should wait. However, if you want a 50" TV for the lowest price possible, you won't find anything much better than this deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Note that this TV was extremely popular yesterday when the deal went live and sold out in a matter of hours. Unless you're located in an obscure zip code, chances are it's out of stock and unavailable at the moment. We have it listed here because there's always a chance it will return prior to or on Black Friday. If not, at least you have a good baseline price point that you can use when checking the prices of other affordable 50" TV deals.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">75" TCL S4 4K Roku TV for $378</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>The Best Black Friday </strong><u><strong>Big Screen</strong></u><strong> Budget TV Deal</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="546c9b06-752a-49ad-abc9-cc16460998d3" id="210664"><div id="210664" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>75" TCL S4 4K Roku TV</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Walmart's other best budget TV deal is on this 75" TCL S4 4K Roku TV for only $378. The S4 is TCL's least expensive 4K TV lineup and even at its everyday retail price of $498 it represents a pretty strong value. At $120 off, it's practically a steal. Aside from the much larger screen size, the TCL S4 is quite similar to the Hisense R6 mentioned above. It features a native 4K resolution, built-in smart TV interface, Motion Rate 120, and auto low latency mode for gaming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This TV is also going out of stock quickly, but there are still plenty of zip codes where this TV is in stock for free shipping or in-store pickup. Will we see a cheaper 75" 4K TV on Black Friday? I don't think so.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">85" Hisense QD7 4K 144Hz QLED Smart TV for $799.99</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>The Best Black Friday Gaming TV Deal</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="a20d0ee3-1973-4756-a904-f668c00f1abc" id="209846"><div id="209846" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>85" Hisense QD7 4K 144Hz QLED Smart TV</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QODApO?object_uuid=2d0a77a8-2014-4f36-8e6c-0ddb4712d14c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/91b0wA?object_uuid=2d0a77a8-2014-4f36-8e6c-0ddb4712d14c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart</a> have dropped the price on the new-for-2024 <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGV7NW?object_uuid=2d0a77a8-2014-4f36-8e6c-0ddb4712d14c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">85" Hisense QD7</a> 4K Smart TV. Right now, you can get it for just $799.99 after a $400 instant discount. This is an excellent deal for a huge TV that can run games in 4K at up to 144Hz on your PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X console. It costs hundreds of dollars less than every TV in our roundup of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">the best TVs for PlayStation 5</a>. For those of you who picked up the new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, perhaps this will help alleviate the sting of spending $700 on a console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The QD7 is one of Hisense's newest TV releases and became available for purchase only a few months ago.

This particular model of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-high-end-4k-tv">4K TV</a> boasts an absolutely huge 85" screen size, full-array LED backlighting, and QLED panel technology for a wider range of colors. It has two HDMI 2.1 ports each capable of up to 144Hz refresh rate. Other gaming-first features include variable refresh rate from 48Hz to 144Hz, auto low latency mode with MEMC, and AMD FreeSync Premium support. For watching movies and shows in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-hdr">HDR</a>, the QD7 supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, HDR10+, and HLG formats. It adopts Google TV as its smart interface, which means any <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-android-phone">Android phone</a> or tablet can be used as a remote control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
