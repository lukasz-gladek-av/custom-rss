            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/persona5-the-phantom-x-brings-the-phantom-thieves-to-pc-and-mobile-devices-next-month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Atlus has revealed its free-to-play spinoff, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x">Persona5: The Phantom X</a>, is coming to PC and mobile devices June 26, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Persona series developer announced a release date for its latest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-5">Persona 5</a> spinoff with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQsdIWTGn_Y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an hour-long breakdown video</a> today. It’s being developed as part of a collaboration between Atlus, Sega, and Perfect World and reintroduces players to the Phantom Thieves along with new faces, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Japanese and English versions of Persona5: The Phantom X will launch simultaneously next month, but this scaled-down story from the Persona 5 universe isn’t completely new. It was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-the-phantom-x-announced-for-ios-and-android">announced in 2023</a> and originally launched in China in 2024. The live-service title's developers have continued to iron out the kinks since then, and now, it’s finally ready to reach new audiences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Encompassed in the unique turn-based RPG gameplay and setting of <em>Persona 5</em>, players will lead a double life as a student and a Phantom Thief with a brand-new protagonist and band of Phantom Thieves,” an official description from Atlus says. “During the day, players will build up life experience as a student and engage in various activities such as hanging out with your friends and part time jobs, while at night, they will sneak into the cognitive dungeons to steal Treasures and change the twisted desires of corrupt adults!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re a Persona 5 fan, you’ll be happy to know The Phantom X still features that game’s stylish turn-based gameplay. Players can also look forward to exploring jobs and extracurricular activities while enjoying new mini-games unique to this specific entry. Atlus wants you to know this is a tried-and-true Persona experience, as it confirms its involvement in writing and supervising some of the original side stories the game offers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona5: The Phantom X will be viewed through the eyes of an entirely new protagonist as well as a new collection of Phantom Thieves, but Joker and other original Phantom Thieves members will show up via special contracts, too. Players will also be free to take advantage of new modes, including a PvE mode called The Velvet Trials as well as new Mementos and a new Guild feature.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Persona5: The Phantom X Steam Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“However, one regret we have is that we had to take this long to be able to announce a Western release,” Sega's Jun Matsunaga said during the video presentation, “and we’re very sorry to our Western fans for keeping them in the dark for so long. As we know, this game was originally developed by Perfect World in China. When we first started to plan for a global release, for a series like Persona that is very popular in the West, we wanted to make sure that for a Western release, everything in the game from the setting to the tone of story matched the standard Western fans had for a Persona game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona 5 launched all the way back in 2016 and has received a plethora of spinoffs since. These include crossovers with other titles such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/07/persona-5s-joker-is-coming-to-super-smash-bros-ultimate-as-dlc">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, as well as standalone experiences, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-5-strikers">Persona 5 Strikers</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-5-tactica">Persona 5 Tactica</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-5-dancing-star-night">Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight</a>. We've heard little about what a potential Persona 6 might entail, but you can still read up on everything we know about it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-6-everything-we-know-so-far">here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

But on May 13, the official account posted a sad Yoshi meme, with the text: "We got cease and desisted." (Thanks for the spot, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-shuts-down-unofficial-smash-bros-dating-app-only-one-day-before-open-beta-launch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>.)</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We got cease &amp; desisted <a href="https://t.co/Zj2J3FNUHL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Zj2J3FNUHL</a> <a href="https://t.co/euDbJ3KUiG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/euDbJ3KUiG</a></p>— SmashTogether (@SmashTogether) <a href="https://twitter.com/SmashTogether/status/1922504070847160448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The app developers don't specify who the cease-and-desist is from, although the assumption would be Nintendo, since it's a Smash Bros. dating app.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">SmashTogether advertised itself as the "premium dating site for Super Smash Bros. enjoyers of all kinds," where one could make their "dream Doubles partner (in and out of Smash)" with a matchmaking algorithm, tailored to "connect you with your ideal Smash Partner."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Included screenshots of the app included sections for listing your character of choice, or "main," as well as notable wins and prompts, similar to those you might find in other dating apps but with a Smash Bros. twist. "I'm looking for... Someone who can make it out of pools at a major," for example.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside concerns over actual IP and copyright infringement, the idea of a dating app around a game like Smash Bros. was probably reason enough for whoever sent the cease-and-desist to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's been no word out of the SmashTogether camp as to whether the team will seek an alternative solution, without Smash Bros. as the foundation. Until then, please appreciate the restraint I've exhibited in this article by not writing a single joke about "smashing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the statement, the company confirmed that such a data breach had taken place, but reassured users that “as of May 12, we have not confirmed the leak of any user personal information or player account information due to the unauthorized access.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company is currently working with outside experts to investigate and confirm the cause of the breach and determine exactly what data was leaked. It also urged people not to access the leaked data due to malware infection risks. However, Arc System Works did not comment on the content of the leak.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/guilty-gear-strive-source-code-leak-explained-season-5-characters-discovered-3193826/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Dexerto</u></a>, the leak contained a Guilty Gear Strive build that features all the remaining Season 4 characters, new moves, and what is believed to be the full Season 5 character line-up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also apparently included in the leak, as reported by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/rumor-arc-system-works-leak-confirms-nintendo-switch-2-cartridge-theory/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Nintendo Everything</u></a>, was information about the three formats available for the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console: digital download only, a Game Key-Card, and a 64 GB physical game cartridge containing the full game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Codenamed “Potion” in the leak, the Game Key-Card is a sort of digital/physical hybrid, a cartridge that comes in a physical box, however it requires the user to download the game to play. So far, the Game Key-Card route seems a common choice among third-party game developers with games planned for the Switch 2. With two of these formats relying on downloads, this quickly raised concerns among video game preservationists as to how easily playable and accessible Switch 2 games will be when the console reaches the end of its lifecycle.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/almost-all-physical-third-party-nintendo-switch-2-games-in-japan-are-game-key-cards-and-it-looks-like-its-a-similar-situation-in-the-west">Almost all physical third-party <u>Nintendo Switch 2</u> games revealed so far are Game-Key Cards</a>.

Digital games / lower capacity cards offer higher margins for publishers. Digital is the majority of sales.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking of Switch 2, the leaks also apparently contained information about a new game that Arc System Works is developing for Nintendo’s upcoming console.
