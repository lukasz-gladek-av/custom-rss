            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A planned talk on Wilds' development has been called off.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has canceled a lecture on the optimization of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> at the upcoming CEDEC 2025 conference in Japan, amid concerns over harassment and threats its staff has been facing over Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-cancels-lecture-about-monster-hunter-wilds-optimization-as-devs-face-threats-and-harassment/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, Capcom was set to host a talk at <a href="https://cedec.cesa.or.jp/2025/timetable/detail/s67ad32469773b/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japan's Computer Entertainment Developers Conference</a>, which would have covered performance optimization through the lens of Monster Hunter Wilds. The developers would have explored the angles of CPU and GPU load, as well as memory usage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No reason was given for the cancellation, but speculation has swirled around whether this is related to harassment the developers have faced over Monster Hunter Wilds. The PC version of Wilds, specifically, has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-mixed-steam-user-review-rating-capcom-issues-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-troubleshooting-guide">garnered criticism since launch</a>, prompting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-director-commits-to-addressing-stability-issues-with-pc-improvements-coming-in-title-update-1">commitments to improvements and updates</a> from the team at Capcom.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the release of Title Update 2, planned adjustments were hoped to have fixed the problem. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-takes-aim-at-performance-woes-but-opinions-vary-on-whether-it-worked">Results seemed varied</a>, however, and Capcom released a statement addressing several major bugs and issues <a href="https://x.com/MH_Wilds/status/1941110323005857917" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Twitter/X</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid all this, though, Capcom <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/support/faq/information_info2025_0266919.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also put out a statement on its official site</a>, responding to what sounds like a more extreme degree of feedback. Per Automaton, Capcom said its staff have faced harassment through social media and customer support channels, including targeted threats against individuals. The company reportedly warned that it will take legal action in severe cases of harassment against employees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So while no official reason was given for the lecture's cancellation, the alignment of these events certainly suggests that concerns over harassment played a role. And it should go without saying that critique and feedback are worthwhile, but these extremes do worse than nothing, and certainly won't assist in tuning Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Wilds itself, Title Update 2 recently went live, and players do seem to be enjoying the addition of several new hunts, especially <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-next-update-adds-the-long-awaited-lagiacrus">the bout with Lagiacrus</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-cancels-lecture-on-monster-hunter-wilds-optimization-amid-harassment-concerns]]></content:encoded>

Is it scientific? Not really. But have fans posted evidence of other N64 classics they believe are now coming anyway? You bet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Super Smash Bros., other potential matches for upcoming N64 games include Donkey Kong 64 (hey, that'd be a good tie-in for the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>!), Ubisoft platformer Ratman 2, retro first-person shooter Forsaken, and bizarre platformer Glover.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I edited the images, arranged them, and made this video, and they fit perfectly. <a href="https://t.co/Bu1tvx0Sxq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Bu1tvx0Sxq</a></p>— Bet (@Betonoguau) <a href="https://twitter.com/Betonoguau/status/1942026877318680791?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The suggestion that Super Smash Bros. might be revived on Switch brings with it the exciting possibility of multiplayer capabilities — could Nintendo even rope up some kind of online play? Regardless, as fans wait for news on Switch 2's inevitable Smash Bros. incarnation (and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-on-his-working-style-the-changing-industry-and-unsustainable-aaa-development">series boss Masahiro Sakurai busies himself making a new Kirby game</a>), it's something to keep us all occupied.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, the Switch 2-exclusive Nintendo Switch Online catalogue of GameCube titles added Super Mario Strikers, adding to its launch roster of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and Soulcalibur 2.
