But while Rockstar’s hotly anticipated sequel has suffered substantial and damaging leaks in the past, this latest leak is anything but.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eagle-eyed leak hunters uncovered an animation reel uploaded to Vimeo by a developer who has worked on a number of Rockstar games. In it were three snippets of development footage apparently showing GTA 6 (they were indeed labeled as such).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, the video was pulled from Vimeo, but the internet noticed and so the GTA 6 clips are doing the rounds. There are three separate clips, each brief and showing animations on what looks like a test map.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first shows a male character removing and inserting a bike into a rental bicycle rack. We see the word ‘LomBike’ on the frame of the bike, which is probably a parody of real life LimeBike rental bicycles. No big surprise there for GTA 6! And we even saw this bike rental system in an official GTA 6 screenshot released by Rockstar earlier this year.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/01/screenshot-2025-12-01-141025-1764599141785.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">You can see GTA 6's bike rental system in official form in the bottom middle portion of this screenshot, just above the bus. Image credit: Rockstar.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other two, similarly brief clips, show a female character, presumably Lucia, getting out the back of a pickup truck in various stages. Again, nothing to write home about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, these very brief animation clips <em>do</em> hint at what we can expect from GTA 6 when it eventually comes out, but they tell us nothing we didn't already know. Of course you'll be able to rent bikes in GTA 6; it was right there in the screenshot, above. And of course you'll be able to jump off a pick up truck. This is GTA 6 we're talking about!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And let’s remember that when you’re actually playing GTA 6, you'll see these animations in finished form — wonderfully detailed and high quality as you’d expect from Rockstar.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This real leak comes hot on the heels of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/increasingly-convincing-ai-generated-gta-6-gameplay-leaks-are-getting-millions-of-views-on-social-media">viral AI-generated GTA 6 gameplay leak</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-backlash-creator-of-viral-gta-6-gameplay-leak-video-insists-it-was-an-experiment-designed-to-show-how-easy-it-has-become-to-blur-the-line-between-reality-and-ai-generated-content">whose creator claimed was all part of a social experiment</a>.

In addition, Taylor asked fans to boycott the game and instead donate the money they would have spent on it to charity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A subsequent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bayonetta-voice-actor-reportedly-offered-at-least-15000-for-role-contrary-to-claims"><u>report from Bloomberg</u></a> (and later corroborated by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-dispute-bayonetta-voice-actors-claims-over-pay-offer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>) revealed that Platinum allegedly attempted to hire Taylor for five four-hour sessions at a rate between $3,000 and $4,000 apiece. This would have put Taylor's total compensation for Bayonetta 3 at $15,000, much higher than the amount she claimed she was offered. Taylor then released a new statement, saying <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bayonetta-3-voice-actress-controversy-new-statement"><u>she was in fact offered $15,000 for the role</u></a>, but she denied aspects of the reports.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hale also released a <a href="https://x.com/jhaletweets/status/1582084319677644801" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> amid increased scrutiny and social media harassment over the situation, although it was vague due to non-disclosure limitations.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, considering whether or not she'd reprise her role as the titular witch, Hale was cautious but candid, admitting that while she'd "love to play Bayonetta again," "it was not fun getting thrown under the bus like I had."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I definitely got thrown under the bus by that whole thing, and I was unable to speak on my own behalf because I was under not one but two NDAs. Eventually, I was allowed to make a statement, which I appreciated, and I was able to present the facts,” Hale told <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/features/jennifer-hale-bayonetta-3-controversy-femshep-223726-20251121" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GAMINGbible</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There were some things said [that were] presented as facts, but were false. I would have never taken a role otherwise. Before I accepted the audition, I checked everything thoroughly, and I trust the director. Thankfully, playing Bayonetta was so much fun, and the community was so welcoming to me, especially after the fiasco had passed and the facts came out. But it was not fun getting thrown under the bus like I had, but I was happy to come out on the other side."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The iconic voice behind Commander Shepard would also love to return for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-next-chapter"><u>Mass Effect 5</u></a>, saying she "would be there before they finish the sentence" if asked. Hale, the actress who gave life to "FemShep" spoke to IGN recently and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-love-that-universe-im-ready-anytime-jennifer-hale-calls-on-fans-to-tell-bioware-theyd-love-to-see-commander-shepard-return-for-mass-effect-5"><u>expressed her desire to return to perhaps her most beloved character</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out she wouldn’t even need to reprise her role as Commander Shepard — just being able to step back into that world again in <em>any</em> form would make her happy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Cyber Monday is your last chance to secure the best offers of the year before the holidays.

The Mario Kart World: Knockout Tour Streamer Showdown, sponsored by Nintendo, stormed onto IGN Entertainment channels last Friday, leaving a trail of discarded bananas, Spiny shells and (virtual) burnt rubber in its wake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">24 variety and gaming influencers from across the UK took part in the contest, which saw competitors completing all 8 rallies in the Knockout Tour mode of the game. With a holiday to Universal Orlando – home to Super Nintendo World at Epic Universe – up for grabs, racers had to contend with high-pressure rounds of elimination in each sprawling race, as they fought for the all important top spot on the leaderboard. But there was additional pride at stake, as streamers were also split into <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRfGgROjV48/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">six teams of four</a>, with unique commemorative trophies for the quartet who racked up the most points throughout the competition.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/27/20251121-120303-1764258800572.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hosts Jane Douglas, George Forsyth-Nash (aka Nash), Mike Channell and Jules Hardy on set</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On hand to oversee proceedings were IGN UK’s George Forsyth-Nash (aka Nash) and Outside Xtra’s Jane Douglas. And stepping up to the mics on colourful commentary duties were Jane’s OX colleague Mike Channell and presenter Jules Hardy, who both provided juicy tidbits of analysis in race previews and debriefs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amidst the racing action, the IGN Guides team shared some expert Mario Kart World tips, and the Nintendo Life crew tested their friendship with a track session of their own, using the Switch 2’s GameChat feature for some lighthearted trash-talking (as is Mario Kart tradition).</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/27/streamershowdownsegements-1764259539476.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Guides team contributed some top tips, and Nintendo Life had a blast playing using Gamechat</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But the Knockout Tour was the main event, and it began with a tense tussle in the Golden Rally, with Purple Team’s TooBizyGaming stealing the win from Blue Team’s GetMadz right at the finish line. There was a strong showing from the Blue Team in the follow up Ice Rally, with KickThePj avoiding a Blue Shell that obliterated Green Team’s OwengeJuiceTV to emerge victorious, and GetMadz again having to settle for second place.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/27/screenshot-2025-11-27-at-15-21-17-1764259789524.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">KickThePj was left stunned as a blue shell just before the finish line gifted him the Icy Rally win</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, ahead of the third race Blue Team were leading the pack, with Purple Team in second and a solid set of results in the upper half of the field pushing the Orange Team into third. The Moon Rally turned up the heat with lava-lined tracks and a resurgence in the use of Bullet Bills, and Team Purple triumphed again with SeaPeeKay taking the crown. However, a second, third and fifth placed finish for the Orange Team (with Solidarity, InTheLittleWood and Ravs landing those spots respectively) saw them shuffle up the team rankings, falling just shy of Purple’s two-point lead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Spiny Rally marked the midway point of proceedings, and the final leg in the tricky Wario Shipyard saw first place switch hands multiple times, before TheOrionSound chalked up another win for the Orange Team. Adam Savage took second for the seemingly ever-present Purple Team, with Beky rounding out the top three with another important result for Team Green.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/27/streamershowdowntheorionsound-1764260128103.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">TheOrionSound celebrates his Spiny Rally win</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the Cherry Rally, TheOrionSound flew to the finish line unchallenged to make it two wins on the trot, with DeanDobbs grabbing second for Blue Team. ChocolateKieran gave the Yellow Team their highest placement yet, finishing in third, whereas previous contender InTheLittlewood tumbled out in twenty-second place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Acorn rally dialled up the drama, with InTheLittlewood making a comeback surge to secure first, with his Orange teammate Solidarity taking second. The top three was completed by Purple Team’s ReadySetBen, to the dismay of Green Team’s Mac_griffiths, who led the race in the approach to the final elimination checkpoint. Upon passing through the gate that whittled down competitors from eight to four, he mistook it for the finish line and began celebrating, before clocking his slip up and facing the insurmountable task of regaining ground.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/27/screenshot-2025-11-27-at-15-35-54-1764260324988.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mac_griffiths realises in horror that he has celebrated a 'win' in the Acorn Rally a lap too early</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This left teams jostling for positions entering the penultimate Cloud Rally. Only two points separated competitors in the individual standings, with Team Orange’s InTheLittlewood and TheOrionSound edging ahead of Purple Team’s new frontrunner SeaPeaKay. Orange had also built up a 15 point lead on Purple, who were opening a similar gap ahead of Team Blue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TooBizGaming landed a decisive win, with OwengeJuiceTV delivering a boost to Team Green with a second place finish. A strong performance from MayPlaysTV gifted Yellow Team some much needed points, but he just missed out on a podium place thanks to another strong result for TheOrionSound.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/27/streamershowdownpenultimaterace-1764260627314.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">MayPlaysTV is delighted with his 4th place finish, while Orange Team top the leaderboard with one race to go</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With everything still to play for going into the final race, the demanding Heart Rally beckoned. A frantic battle for the lead involved at least seven racers switching places at the front of the pack, before a final leg struggle emerged between Solidarity, OwenegeJuiceTV, ChocolateKieran and InTheLittlewood. Previously sacrosanct alliances between team members crumbled, as they kept one eye on the track, and the other on the finishing position that would land them a trip to Florida.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the nail-biting six-track run, OwengeJuiceTV crossed the line in Peach Stadium first, closely followed by InTheLittleWood and ChocolateKieran. But a consistent run of results since his Race 5 crash-out meant that InTheLittlewood sealed his – and Orange Team’s – overall victory.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/27/screenshot-2025-11-27-at-15-40-15-1764260760403.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Streamer Showdown champion InTheLittlewood (top left) with his fellow Orange Team racers</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The final standings were as follows:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/27/streamershowdownfinalstandings-1764261757576.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Orange top the team leaderboard, with InTheLittlewood claiming the individual prize in the Mario Kart World: Knockout Tour Streamer Showdown</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Congratulations to Martyn aka InTheLittlewood and his Orange Team compatriots!

Complete those quests and the NPC will become more friendly, and even send you the odd gift. Indeed, Where Winds Meet's player and NPC relationships feature revolves around this AI chatbot feature.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As perfectly demonstrated by u/Kamijoan in the Where Winds Meet subreddit, you can use the game's own AI logic against it by simply writing "(tells him the correct answer)." That was enough to fool the AI into thinking the player had done precisely that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other players have used similar phrases to progress — "(Guesses the answer correctly)" was one, although that seems to only work some of the time — some admit they only resorted to this after being told incorrect, or impossible, clues, such as a horned animal being an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1pauq27/comment/nro2mq4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>elephant</u></a>, or a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1pauq27/comment/nrnb0ff/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one-word answer having two words</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others have used the chatbots to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1p13j9w/at_first_i_tried_to_speak_normally_to_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>skip the sidequests</u></a>, including by using the "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1p5aqyk/the_metal_gear_method_unironically_works/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Solid Snake Method</u></a>" in which you reply to the chatbot with the last few words the AI said with a question mark. Do it enough, and you'll zip through the encounter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The "Solid Snake Method" is a conversational technique for when you don't know what to say that has become something of a meme. It involves repeating a word or phrase from the other person's sentence back to them as a question to keep the conversation going without having to come up with a new topic. It's named after the character Solid Snake from the Metal Gear Solid video game series, who frequently uses this tactic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not the only way that people are messing with the AI chatbots, either. Someone else convinced the Zhao Dali AI bot that they were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oxqhuz/anybody_else_mentally_break_the_zhao_dali_ai_just/?" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pregnant with its child</u></a>, which escalated with alarming speed to an eulogy and an AI bot "falling to his knees, weeping uncontrollably."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/01/anybody-else-mentally-break-the-zhao-dali-a-i-just-to-see-v0-bj62672pze1g1-1764587938608.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: u/MisterZan25.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Where Winds Meet is developed by Everstone Studio and published by NetEase Games. IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-winds-meet-review">Where Winds Meet review</a> returned a 6/10. We said: "Where Winds Meet has a great understanding of what makes wuxia such a compelling genre, but its attempt to shove so many different things into one game only ensures that none of those elements reach their full potential."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier today, we reported that Where Winds Meet had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-wuxia-adventure-where-winds-meet-hits-9-million-players-in-just-2-weeks-and-the-mobile-version-isnt-even-out-yet"><u>topped 9 million players in just two weeks</u></a> after launching on PC and PS5.
