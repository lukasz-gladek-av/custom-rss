            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rekindling the long-running debate about whether Call of Duty skins have well and truly gone off the deep end, Beavis and Butt-Head are heading to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beavis and Butt-Head are perhaps the poster boys of the MTV generation and genuine 90s cartoon icons. Created by Mike Judge, Beavis and Butt-Head are two idiotic teen slackers who sit around grunting and giggling at rock music on MTV.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty has form when it comes to 90s-themed skins, so perhaps we shouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see Beavis and Butt-Head finally get their moment in the shooter. But what is perhaps surprising is how their skins look, which is a jarring combination of the cartoon style fans know Beavis and Butt-Head for, but wearing MilSim outfits.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Mike Judge‚Äôs Beavis &amp; Butt-Head are coming to Call of Duty Season 04 Reloaded üî• <a href="https://t.co/3QnIYMv2AN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3QnIYMv2AN</a></p>‚Äî Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1937194237554295005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúOf all the collabs to get military-themed outfits in this game, I definitely did not see Beavis and Butt-Head getting one,‚Äù <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1limd1t/comment/mzd1p8m/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor RdJokr1993</a>. ‚ÄúLol these are unironically more MilSim than most skins in the game,‚Äù added LoneRogue2018.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are coming up with on-brand one-liners we might hear Beavis and Butt-Head say in-game. For example: ‚ÄúHeh heh heh heh, he said 'Duty.'‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, Beavis and Butt-Head shouldn‚Äôt come as any surprise to anyone who‚Äôs played Call of Duty in the last few years. This is a game that has the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a Dragon Knight that looks straight out of Skyrim, and, more recently, a skin made from strips of bacon, all running around realistic, war-torn environments. Activision releases these sorts of skins and players complain about realism, but they sell enough for Activision to keep releasing these sorts of skins. And so the cycle continues.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The question will be how much Beavis and Butt-Head cost. Activision has come under fire recently for its ultra aggressive monetization of Black Ops 6 and Warzone, with some players complaining about the high price of bundles, the introduction of event passes, and ever more expensive battle passes. Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-insists-heavily-criticized-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-ads-in-loadout-menus-were-a-test-published-in-error-strips-them-out-following-backlash">Activision pulled controversial adverts placed inside Black Ops 6 and Warzone loadouts</a>, insisting they were a ‚Äúfeature test‚Äù published ‚Äúin error.‚Äù It‚Äôs worth remembering that Black Ops 6 is a premium, $70 game, and this year‚Äôs Black Ops 7 is set to jump to $80.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And will this Beavis and Butt-Head skin carry forward into the recently announced Black Ops 7? Activision has yet to say. But given the timing of its release, the hope is that anyone who forks out for Beavis and Butt-Head will get bang for their buck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Call of Duty players are speculating that getting a headshot against Beavis and Butt-Head might be a little easier than against other skins in the game. Is this a pay-to-lose bundle?</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Good luck to those sitting on them headies‚Ä¶ üíÄ <a href="https://t.co/U4nd9l8PxS" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/U4nd9l8PxS</a></p>‚Äî Team WaR (@OfficialTeamWaR) <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialTeamWaR/status/1937196728785993828?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">We don't know when the Season 4 Reloaded mid-season update is set to launch exactly, but based on how many days players have left to complete the Season 4 battle pass, it should be released on or around June 26.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
