            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Play any game in 4K at 60fps for well under $2K.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards are dropping back down in price, and fortunately that means prebuilt gaming PCs are becoming more affordable as well. Currently, Walmart is offering the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXWXoe?object_uuid=952f1dff-2955-42a5-9033-a6b48e9f457b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Acer Nitro 60</a> gaming PC, featuring an Intel Core i7 CPU and GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU, for just $1,799.99 with free delivery. This is one of the lowest prices I've seen for a well-equipped 5070 Ti prebuilt with a generous amount of RAM and SSD storage out of the box.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Acer Nitro 60 RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC for $1,800</h2><div catalogid="ad10ab66-cb3f-4ef3-a4ba-d43e48582ae1" id="227373"><div id="227373" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Acer Nitro 60 Intel Core i7-14700F RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Acer Nitro 60 gaming PC is equipped with an Intel Core i7-14700 processor, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti graphics card, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 2TB PCIe Gen 4 M.2 SSD. The Intel Core i7-14700 CPU has a max turbo frequency of 5.4GHz with 20 cores, 28 threads, and a 28MB L2 cache. Although one generation old, the i7-14700 is still an excellent relevant CPU for both gaming and producitivity use. It's cooled by a 120mm tower heatsink fan combo and three extra 120mm system fans.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The RTX 5070 Ti GPU Has Excellent 4K Gaming Performance</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all the Blackwell cards released thus far, the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck, especially when pitted against the previous generation GPUs. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. Like all Blackwell cards, the RTX 5070 Ti supports <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dlss-4-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-about-nvidias-latest-ai-upscaling-tech">DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation</a>.  This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution. If you plan on using this card for AI, the RTX 5070 Ti may be a better value since it has the same amount of VRAM as the RTX 5080.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
