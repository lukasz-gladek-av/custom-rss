The only award it did not receive a nomination for was the Social Impact award.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, a few games were present in quite a few categories this year. Ghost of Yōtei received five nominations and an honorable mention, and Blue Prince and Donkey Kong Bananza came away with four nominations apiece.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Developers Choice Awards will take place on Thursday, March 12 at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. Unlike previous years, the Independent Game Festival awards, which usually take place on the same day prior to the GDC Awards ceremony, will now take place the day before on Wednesday, March 11.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though there's been some public debate about whether or not Clair Obscur qualifies as an "indie" game or not, it did not receive any nominations in the IGFs - possibly either <a href="https://igf.com/igf-competition-rules/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">due to not being eligible</a>, or simply not being submitted by its studio for consideration in the first place. Baby Steps was the most-nominated game in the IGFs this year with five nominations, including for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best Audio</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (Sandfall Interactive / Kepler Interactive)</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach (Kojima Productions / Sony Interactive Entertainment)</li><li>Ghost of Yōtei (Sucker Punch Productions / Sony Interactive Entertainment)</li><li>Rift of the NecroDancer (Brace Yourself Games, Tic Toc Games / Klei Publishing)</li><li>South of Midnight (Compulsion Games / Xbox Game Studios)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Honorable Mentions: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">ARC Raiders (Embark Studios), Donkey Kong Bananza (Nintendo EPD / Nintendo), Doom: The Dark Ages (id Software / Bethesda Softworks), Lumines Arise (Enhance / Monstars Inc.), To a T (uvula LLC / Annapurna Interactive)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best Debut</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>BALL X PIT (Kenny Sun &amp; Friends / Devolver Digital)</li><li>Blue Prince (Dogubomb / Raw Fury)</li><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (Sandfall Interactive / Kepler Interactive)</li><li>Dispatch (Adhoc Studio)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Honorable Mentions: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">ARC Raiders (Embark Studios), Consume Me (Jenny Jiao Hsia), Hollow Knight: Silksong (Team Cherry), The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy (Too Kyo Games, Media.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The next Life is Strange game will launch this year and be fully revealed next week, publisher Square Enix has confirmed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">An official announcement of the project, widely expected to be titled Life is Strange: Reunion and feature the return of fan-favorite character Chloe, will take place next Tuesday, January 20 at 10am Pacific, 1pm Eastern, or 6pm UK time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2eHeCKYHJc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> stream link is already available for the announcement, which is accompanied by the description: "Separate the real from the rumor... Join us for the exclusive reveal of the next Life is Strange game." </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/screenshot-2026-01-15-164656-1768495661681.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Life is Strange has teased the return of Chloe Price.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On Facebook, a brief teaser <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2eHeCKYHJc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> shows what looks two characters walking by, their faces largely obscured. The second figure then turns their back fully to the camera, showing what looks to be a crow embroidered onto the back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Certainly, fans suspect these are the Life is Strange franchise's original duo Max Caulfield and Chloe Price. Caulfield returned after a long hiatus as the protagonist of the franchise's previous game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, which received a mixed reception from fans for its treatment of the pair's relationship. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Max's return in a subsequent sequel was promised at the end of Double Exposure, so it would be no surprise to see her back again here. Exactly how this new game handles Chloe (and explains her presence, depending on players' past choices) remains to be seen, however. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-life-is-strange-game-spotted-and-yes-this-one-will-finally-bring-back-chloe">last week's early spilling of the game's likely title and plot</a> via the European ratings board, and a string of disgruntled leaks from developers pointing to a troubled development for the franchise behind the scenes, Square Enix's suggestion that fans should tune in to "separate the real from the rumor" feels like an acknowledgement of the series' current situation — but also, hopefully, that it has something promising for fans to move the franchise forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The retailer has quite a few discounts worth checking out right now, including a particularly solid deal on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of Best Buy’s Winter Sale, Ninja Gaiden 4 has dropped to $39.99 for both <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qd8NvZ?object_uuid=154d7934-05b6-4394-b879-28398def16bb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/ak1JYn?object_uuid=154d7934-05b6-4394-b879-28398def16bb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X</a>. Compared to its retail price of $69.99, this saves you $30 overall. Keep in mind that this sale only runs until January 19. Be quick to grab it before the discount disappears.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ninja Gaiden 4 for $39.99</h2><div id="234477"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234477" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>NINJA GAIDEN 4 Standard Edition - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div></span></p></div><div id="234478"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234478" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>NINJA GAIDEN 4 Standard Edition - Xbox Series X</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For those looking to jump into an action game right now, Ninja Gaiden 4 is certainly worth checking out. Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-review">review</a> from IGN’s Mitchell Saltzman said, “Despite its disappointing story and bland level design, Ninja Gaiden 4's excellent combat still make it one of the best 3D action games in recent memory.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It even earned a runner-up nomination for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-action-game-of-2025">Best Action Game of 2025</a>, as it’s a “pure action fan’s action game, featuring some of the best melee combat we've seen in years, bolstered by aggressive enemy AI, excellent weapon design, and the ability to let your creativity run wild by giving you the freedom to hotswap between all of your weapons on the fly.” If that’s sold you, why wait to grab it? No better time than when it’s $30 off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned earlier, January has seen quite a few video game deals catch our eye alongside this one. Also in Best Buy’s Winter Sale that’s worth a look is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-miss-out-on-sonic-racing-crossworlds-down-to-45-as-part-of-best-buys-winter-sale">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, which has dropped to $45</a>, but that’s not all. Our breakdown of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-winter-sale-video-game-deals-january-2026">Best Buy’s Winter Sale</a> highlights even more gaming goodies worth grabbing while they’re still discounted. Outside of Best Buy, Amazon even has some good offers available at the moment, including deals on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-for-ps5-is-back-to-its-lowest-price-yet-at-amazon">Assassin’s Creed Shadows for PS5</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-gets-a-7-discount-at-both-amazon-and-walmart">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 15, 2026 4:35 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-deal-best-buys-winter-sale-2026]]></content:encoded>
