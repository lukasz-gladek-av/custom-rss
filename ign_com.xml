And once again, it’ll be a show focused on world premieres and exclusive new trailers with no talking heads or any other fluff. Just games.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>TinyBuild Connect Date, Time, and How to Watch</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The full event will be livestreamed on Tuesday, May 27 starting at 1:00 p.m. Eastern / 12:00 p.m. Central / 10:00 a.m. Pacific. For our friends across the pond, that’s 7:00 p.m. CET. It’ll start promptly at those times and will jump right into the games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/"><u>IGN.com</u></a> (our homepage)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ign/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s Facebook</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ign/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s Twitter</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ign" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s Twitch</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ign?lang=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s TikTok</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw?themeRefresh=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s YouTube</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not able to catch the show live, you’ll be able to watch the whole thing on our YouTube page after it finishes. Just like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMre7n_HPao" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>last year’s show</u></a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>What to Expect from tinyBuild Connect 2025</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This will be a dense show, with lots of reveals and announcements packed into less than 30 minutes. There will be a mix of premieres of previously unannounced games, new info about announced games, and updates for released titles, highlighted by upcoming titles Hello Neighbor 3, Ferocious, and Kingmakers. You can expect a new look at gameplay for both HN3 and Ferocious, while Kingmakers is getting a Steam Early Access release date announcement. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hello Neighbor 3 was announced last year and is the latest entry in the adventure sandbox thriller series. You’ll return to the town of Raven Brooks, this time as a stranger with no ties to the town. Raven Brooks functions as a real-time sandbox simulation, where every player’s decision is the right one. It’s populated by residents who act based on their personalities, relationships, desires, and goals. The game is currently in the playtesting phase, so now seems like the right time for an update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ferocious made a strong impression during last year’s Games Baked in Germany showcase with its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ferocious-official-mecha-trailer-games-baked-in-germany-showcase"><u>cinematic trailer</u></a>. Developed by Omyog, a small German team with veterans from the film and AAA game industries, the game is a survival-focused, narrative-driven FPS set on a remote island filled with dinosaurs and hostile mercenaries. Among the team is the former Level Design Director of Far Cry 3, Narrative Director of Far Cry 4, and Campaign Creative Director of Star Wars Battlefront II, so it’s safe to say it’s an experienced team.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/20/tb-connect-2025-final-artwork-1747758278474.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingmakers was revealed last year too, and it took the IGN audience by storm. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingmakers-combines-back-to-the-future-with-army-of-darkness-and-its-blowing-up-right-now-ign-next"><u>featured it on IGN Next</u></a> because its trailer was a surprise hit, getting more than 11 million views across our social channels. Like Ferocious, it resonated thanks to its unique premise. Kingmakers is a mix of third-person shooter and RTS set in medieval Europe. You might be thinking, “How could a shooter be set in medieval times?” Well, you’re a time traveler who’s been sent to the past with modern weapons to alter the course of history. TinyBuild has confirmed that they’ll be announcing the game’s release date in Steam’s Early Access, so you can look forward to that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those are some of the games you can expect to get updates, but there will be plenty more announcements and updates we can’t see coming. Tune in on May 27 to see all of it.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
