            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The original 2006 Gears of War is the classic case of "don't judge a book by its cover;" this seemingly meatheaded, bro-forward game has cemented itself as not only one of the best third-person cover shooter series with its iconic gameplay and weapons, but also one that shrugs at its stereotypes to both embrace them (when was the last time you heard someone called a dickwad?) and defy them with great storytelling and fantastic voice acting. Ten years after its first makeover, it's gotten another with Gears of War: Reloaded. Unlike some games that get a premature remaster treatment a few years after their release, this one looks and feels like a noticeable improvement. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we’ve come to expect from Xbox Game Studios developer The Coalition, the PS5 and Steam crowds are welcomed to the first game in this iconic series with gorgeous modern graphics and framerates, and no more waiting around on long load screens. Before we get into the details of Reloaded, here's what IGN said about Gears of War’s first remaster from 2015: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From playing about seven hours, I can say that the glowing review of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition and its few faults still stand true with Reloaded. The story begins by throwing you into the thick of a losing war. Things go from shit to shittier for Marcus Fenix and crew as they try to accomplish one task that spirals out of control, and while that may not be fun for them, it sure is exciting to play, especially with the technical updates. Here are the highlights: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reloaded plays in 4K with up to 120Hz output (if you've got the screen for it). </li><li>The 60fps is a nice upgrade on consoles for the campaign, which previously only went up to 30fps at its launch and 60fps with the Series X performance boost, and 120fps in multiplayer is equally welcome.</li><li>There are more options to change up controls, audio, and more Reloaded than were in Ultimate Edition.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>A Touch of Color</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2015 Gears of War: Ultimate Edition did a great job upgrading the notoriously drab look of the Xbox 360 original with color adjustments, lifting the muddy grey and brown fog from the planet Sera. Reloaded takes that a step further, with an even more lively color palette and better lighting that resembles what we saw in Gears 5. The uplifted style gives extra vibrancy to splurting blood during a chainsaw kill, and the blue skies clouded by smoke and dust look nice, too. The Coalition added extra detail to the environment as well, like additional paintings in legal buildings, dense bookshelves, fridges with rotting food, more corpses, and other fitting decor like that.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Gears of War Review Ever</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Welcome to Delta Squad, PS5 </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's still mighty odd seeing Xbox Game Studios on the screen while I hold a DualSense, but I can only say that the shredding of exclusivity lines hasn't hurt Gears of War one bit. If anything, it's made a strong case for me to do a co-op run on PlayStation 5. The core of Reloaded is the same between all three platforms, but the DualSense adds a twist with the adaptive triggers and any comms done through radio output through the controller's speaker. It was a neat surprise having dialogue and sound effects – like hitting the perfect active reload – presented this way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, the adaptive triggers can be off-putting in some situations, like when hopping on a Troika where the triggers feel like they're on max resistance for firing the turret or when driving a vehicle, so I could see them being unwelcome to some. I got tired of it in the second act during a long driving section, so I ended up turning adaptive triggers off for a bit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another aspect of Gears that's evolved over time is the heavy screen shake with the roadie run. It's less pronounced in other Gears games that’ve come along since, but The Coalition kept the exaggerated effect for Reloaded by default. I appreciate its unique touch and that the shakiness encourages tactical use. Running around an encounter isn't the way to play Reloaded, and if you do, you'll likely be punished for it. Instead, you'll want to run and bounce between cover, keeping yourself protected from the onslaught of enemy fire.  If you don't like screen shake, though, it can be turned off. It's good to have options! </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Some Minor Bugs</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The cool additions are also joined by some minor bugs I’ve seen in the roughly six hours I’ve played on PlayStation 5. There was weirdness in checkpoints jumping me forward and facing a different way, characters’ voices would drop for a line randomly, and I saw some enemies get stuck in between cover. Those bugs have appeared infrequently and weren’t too bothersome, though, and are probably nothing a patch or two won’t fix. I didn't see these happen much during my time with the Xbox version, but just because I didn't see them doesn't mean they aren't there. Bugs are tricky like that!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Bad Squad AI</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The one actively annoying gameplay issues I came across was how incompetent and overall wonky my AI companions were on the Hardcore difficulty level, which is a noticeable downgrade from how they performed in Ultimate Edition. In Reloaded, they go down <em>constantly, </em>whereas in Ultimate Edition they still went down occasionally, but seemed to be helping more<em>.</em> Hardcore is only a step above normal and below Insane, so I expected they should be able to hold their own at least a bit. I noticed Dom waltzing into the dark and dying to the lurking Kryll that shredded him in seconds in one mission, and every now and then, Dom or the other two companions, Cole and Baird, would get stuck far behind, unwilling to leave a doorway. I love Delta squad, but I'm not reviving them every encounter only to put myself in danger.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Cherry on Top: Extras for Gears Fans</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War: Reloaded includes a nice Extras section, which is something you'd want to see in a remaster like this to reward returning fans who’re buying it for the second or third time. What'll interest most folks in the Extras section are the five different issues of the Gears of War comic. Grabbing the collectible COG Tags throughout the campaign unlocks pages in five different issues of the Gears of War comic, which is a nice reward for those who haven't read them. This was available in the Ultimate Edition, and it's a welcome return. Completing acts of the campaign also unlocks neat concept art.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, while multiple sets of credits may not be what someone who’s new to this game cares about, for folks like me, seeing the credits available for Reloaded, Ultimate Edition, and the original are in line with Gears' respect for teamwork.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Multiplayer Only Has Minor Tweaks</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Multiplayer hasn't changed (in terms of what content is included) between Ultimate Edition and Reloaded, though The Coalition upgraded to 60Hz dedicated servers, as opposed to the 30Hz we’ve had in previous versions. The maps got the remaster treatment too, with better lighting, visual effects, and best of all, an upgrade to 120fps on consoles (PC players also get a 240fps option). I expect weapon tuning to be in flux after launch; The Coalition already noted it's making some improvements to the Gnasher, making perfect active reload damage fixed, and more tweaks based on feedback from the beta. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Miranda's Top 10 Games of 2025</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Get Your COG Tags </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If this is your first time playing Gears of War, I recommend finding a friend to join you – the Gears of War teams have always designed these games with a partner in mind (and as I mentioned, the AI doesn’t really pull its weight on the higher difficulty levels). The Coalition thankfully maintained the option to play Reloaded couch co-op, which we don’t see enough these days, and of course, you've also got the option of online crossplay if your co-op buddy is on another system. I'm still undecided on whether or not I want to spend my next co-op replay on Xbox or PS5 or bounce between them (thanks, cross-progression!), but I'm excited to dive back in again either way.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-review-update]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"They can't get the hardware. It's really difficult right now."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A fresh report has detailed the difficulties faced by some developers keen to launch games for Switch 2 — but who remain unable to do so due to a lack of Nintendo support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0SW7R5H5wY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a>, Nintendo is still restricting its supply of Switch 2 development hardware and instead telling some studios to launch their titles as Switch 1 games that can then be played via backwards compatibility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This has sparked frustration among a number of developers, including at least one major AAA studio unable to launch a Switch 2-native version of their game, while hardware is given to some indie creators — including the team behind a campfire simulator.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's been a lot of talk about this lately, that Nintendo seems to be almost discouraging Switch 2 development to some degree," Digital Foundry's John Linneman said during the team's most recent podcast. "I've spoken with plenty of developers where they were told that their game, they should just ship it on Switch 1 and rely on backwards compatibility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's a lot of developers that are unable to get Switch 2 dev kits," Linneman continued. "We talked to a lot of devs at Gamescom this year, and so many of them said the same things. They want to ship on Switch 2. They would love to do Switch 2 versions. They can’t get the hardware. It's really difficult right now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One particular frustration has been the lack of transparency from Nintendo on why some studios have been given Switch 2 development kits, while others have not. IGN has contacted Nintendo for comment. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't really know what Nintendo’s mindset was with these sets of decisions," Digital Foundry's Oliver Mackenzie said. "I don’t really understand the strategy because, like you said, even now developers are struggling to get systems, and I know that some months ago when we were hearing things through the grapevine and talking to people, there were some weird exclusions with some big developers struggling to get kits for games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"From what we've heard, there were some weird inclusions as well," he continued. "Some indies were included, which is nice to see. But there’s that campfire game, you know, the camera campfire game, and they’re getting kits. And some big developers, on the other hand, who developed AAA stuff, aren’t necessarily in the pipeline there for kits."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The camera campfire game here in question is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/chillin-by-the-fire">Chillin' by the Fire</a>, an indie hangout game set around a campfire which makes use of the Switch 2 camera. On the one hand, the simple fact this makes use of GameChat and the Switch 2's camera capabilities makes this impossible to launch on Switch 1, meaning that development hardware for Nintendo's newer console would be required. On the other, it's understandable why some AAA developers might be surprised to see this launch, after being told they wouldn't yet receive a Switch 2 development kit for themselves.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's weird stuff about discouraging Switch 2 development explicitly for some games, a limited subset of games like if you're doing a pixel art game at 240p, you probably don't need a Switch 2 kit," Mackenzie added. "But there are very few games on the Switch 1 that wouldn't benefit from being ported explicitly to Switch 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The thing that’s really stark to me too is, at this point, we’ve seen very few proper Switch 2 Editions post-launch. I don’t think we’ve seen any, hardly at all really, from third-party developers in particular. Obviously we saw No Man’s Sky, I think one or two other games in the mix there. But really, it’s been a very slow trickle of titles earning that Switch 2 Edition badge. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I really want to see more movement on that front. I hope it’s a temporary thing," Mackenzie concluded. "I hope that in a year or two, we’re looking back and we’re like, that was a really weird decision, but it was fixed in time. I hope that’s what we’re looking at."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier today, it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-reportedly-set-for-september-as-metroid-prime-4-release-date-and-mario-40th-anniversary-speculation-mounts">Nintendo was planning a fresh Direct due this September</a>, with fan hopes high for word on Metroid Prime 4 and Mario details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The next season of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> will include the long-awaited return of Mythical unicorn Keldeo — though players who paid $7.99 to own the creature during its original release will not be given a second, IGN has been told.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Go's 20th season, Tales of Transformation, will mark the first time Keldeo has been available in the game since December 2022, when a limited-time Special Resarch including the creature was briefly sold. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lengthy wait for it to become available again has been a growing source of frustration among players over the last few years, especially newer fans who have been waiting to unlock its Pokédex entry.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All players will be given research centering on Keldeo as part of the season's main storyline — something which will also unlock the beast's previously unobtainable Resolute Form. However, IGN was told in a pre-announcement briefing that existing Keldeo owners will not receive a second Keldeo as part of this research, and will instead simply receive more Keldeo candy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's new season details come amid a flurry of reveals from the Pokémon Go team, including yesterday's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-go-boosting-level-cap-and-rebalancing-experience-in-first-major-xp-change-for-5-years">major announcement that the game's level cap will be raised from 50 to 80 in October</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other (less major but very cute) news, an in-game celebration was announced this morning for the Netflix stop-motion series Pokémon Concierge, including a special Psyduck in a rubber ring costume. Looking ahead, datamining suggests that details of 2025's year-end Pokémon Go Wild Area event are on the horizon, while evidence points to some kind of remote trading option also being worked upon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
