            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Free-to-play time-traveling strategic RPG Reverse: 1999 just launched its biggest collaboration yet, its first to ever launch simultaneously worldwide, and it teamed up with another time-jumping franchise to do it: Assassin’s Creed. The collab adds new story chapters and popular characters Ezio, Kassandra, and Alexios, all three of whom will be playable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reverse: 1999 first launched in 2023 and has seen global success in the time since. It’s been downloaded more than 30 million times worldwide and stands at “very positive” with more than 2,500 reviews on Steam. Those fans have been clamoring for this collab since it was first announced earlier this year, and there’s been particular excitement about the addition of Ezio — as you can see from the 270,000 views and hundreds of comments on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brCaA-vcDmQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>his official trailer</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the characters and story content might be the headliners of this collab, there’s a lot more to it than that. You can see Assassin’s Creed inspirations in the UI, music, and garments that have been added. Plus, there are free goodies being given away (including Alexios), extra prizes in the gacha system designed to make it easier to pull the new characters, and both online and offline events to celebrate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s get into the details, shall we?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/07/offline-events-1754590432413.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Familiar Faces in a Journey Through History</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Reverse: 1999’s story takes you through different eras of history, and that trend continues with this crossover, whose new content will be released in two phases. Phase 1 is live right now and will run until September 18. It adds a story chapter that brings you to Florence, Italy, where you’ll meet the legendary Ezio Auditore da Firenze from Assassin’s Creed II.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gS2PNVbI9hs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>collaboration trailer</u></a> hints at how the story of Phase 1 will bring you into contact with Ezio. Mr. APPLe, one of the important characters of Reverse: 1999, is mistaken for a fabled Apple of Eden and must be protected. He’s nearly dissected by Leonardo da Vinci, another character from Assassin’s Creed II who plays a significant role in the Phase 1 story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brCaA-vcDmQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Ezio’s character trailer</u></a> shows some of the memories from his journey in Assassin’s Creed II — his assassinations, gathering feathers for his brother, the tragic execution of his family — materializing into different weapons, which references the unique ability he brings into Reverse: 1999. He can wield several different primary and secondary weapons and can swap them out as needed, so he’s always ready for any situation.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/07/ezio-skills-1754588499590.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Like all other 6-star characters, Ezio comes with two garments, the second of which is unlocked after increasing his Insight level. His first garment is the assassins’ classic white robe, and his second (featured in the photo of him above) is the Armor of Altair from Assassin’s Creed II, which was built by and named after the hero of the original Assassin’s Creed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kassandra and Alexios will join in on the fun when the story shifts to Ancient Greece in Phase 2 of the collab, which will run from August 28 to September 18. Like Ezio, Kassandra will get a unique ability designed to make her adaptable: She has three skill trees (Hunter, Warrior, and Assassin) and can switch between them.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/07/kassandra-skills-1754588518136.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the characters and plot, Assassin’s Creed fans will notice other references. The level selection interface adopts the genetic sequence design of the Animus, and music — including the familiar song “Ezio’s Family” — has been pulled from the Assassin’s Creed series. The Into the Shadows mode will let you see the villa in Monteriggioni and complete events in Florence and Venice to experience the Renaissance assassin life like Ezio.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/07/animus-ui-1754588548609.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Dress Up for the Special Collab</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It wouldn’t be a Reverse: 1999 update without new garments, and this collab is no exception. Four characters have new garments inspired by Assassin’s Creed and Greek mythology (pictured below). Hissabeth’s new look is inspired by Medusa, the famous snake-haired Gorgon from Greek myth who put up a hell of a fight in Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey. The art showing off her new garment shows her dancing between Medusa’s two sisters frozen in stone, the crown she wears pays homage to Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey’s Medusa design, and the artifact she’s holding resembles an Apple of Eden.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marcus’s new garment draws from the myth of the musician Orpheus, who traveled to the underworld and used his music to convince Hades to let him take back his deceased wife Eurydice, on the condition that he not look back at her until they reached the surface. During their ascension, Orpheus was overcome with doubt and couldn’t help looking back, and Eurydice was taken from him forever. Marcus’s art recalls this moment of legend, as she glances back and offers her hand to guide her fallen friends to the gates of the underworld.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vila gets a new garment inspired by the Sirens of Homer’s Odyssey who would lure sailors to their deaths with their beautiful song. Her artwork shows her standing among violet waves and singing as storms gather around her, and the Poseidon statue beside her is pulled directly from Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last but certainly not least, APPLe’s new garment turns him gold, and you can see how Leonardo da Vinci and other characters in Florence would mistake him for an Apple of Eden, the symbol of desire and temptation. And best of all, APPLe’s new garment is free for all players during the collaboration event.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/07/new-garments-1754588582161.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>A Celebration with Free Goodies</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">APPLe’s new garment isn’t the only thing that’s free. In this collab version, every player can get a free monthly pass that allows them to get 2,700 Clear Drops in total, which is 15 free gacha pulls. Additionally, free resources given out during the collaboration will make it possible to have at least 43 pulls on the event banners. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">During Phase 2, everyone can recruit Alexios for free by taking part in the collaboration’s events. Plus, to celebrate the partnership with Assassin’s Creed, players can receive additional collaboration characters after 100/160/220/280 pulls. And there are other log-in and event rewards that you can see in the image below.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/07/event-rewards-1754588619674.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>There’s Always More to Learn</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You can download Reverse: 1999 for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3092660/Reverse_1999/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Steam</u></a>, the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reverse-1999/id1672933190?source_caller=ui&amp;shortlink=o8b6chbd&amp;c=GlobalLaunch_Website_ios&amp;pid=Website&amp;af_xp=custom" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>iOS App Store</u></a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bluepoch.m.en.reverse1999&amp;source_caller=ui&amp;shortlink=ujn2ppo2&amp;c=GlobalLaunch_Website_android&amp;pid=Website&amp;af_xp=custom" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Google Play</u></a> and <a href="https://re1999.bluepoch.com/en/home/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Windows PC</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has flat out said that fans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-isnt-considering-the-sims-5-right-now-because-its-not-player-friendly-to-expect-fans-to-give-up-all-of-the-content-that-youve-purchased-over-the-years">shouldn't expect The Sims 5 anytime soon</a>. But if you're looking for a new release from the franchise, you'll be happy to know a new Sims game actually did just come out July. Did you somehow miss this momentous news? I certainly did, and that's because it's actually just a board game. The Sims Board Game arrived at Target on July 20, 2025 and it seems to have gone largely unnoticed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which makes a lot of since to me. It's been a long time since I've <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-the-sims-4-for-free">played The Sims 4</a>, but having spent a decent amount of time in that game I can't really conceptualize how it would effectively transition to a tabletop experience. The board game itself is a collaboration with Goliath that was <a href="https://toybook.com/goliath-toy-fair-the-sims/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced back in February</a> and garnered a bit of news coverage from various gaming outlets, but now that it's available to buy nobody seems to be talking about it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Sims Board Game Is Now Available</h2><div catalogid="cdfb0e74-d1e7-4aeb-ae61-69db2d44034c" id="226620"><div id="226620" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Sims Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I have no plans on ever purchasing or playing this game, but for the sake of this article I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhJRd7kETJg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watched the official how to play video</a> recently published on the Goliath YouTube channel. It's about five and a half minutes long and after sitting through the whole thing, I'm still not sure how to categorize this game or even how to actually play it. The gameplay and rules seem unnecessarily confusing despite the narrator suggesting just "tossing out the rulebook" early on in the video. The main theme of the game is that each player tries to earn points by completing aspirations and various actions throughout play. The first player to eight points wins, with the bonus option of playing to 10 points instead to make the game longer.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/07/81xkkoo1k2l-ac-sl1500-1754608096208.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The full set up</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As confusing as the gameplay seems, what turns me off to this game the most about this game is that it's meant for 2-5 players. That immediately removes the thing about playing The Sims I enjoyed the most: That I got to do it by myself. Introducing one or more players into the experience seems like a recipe for disaster. It's being marketed as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board game</a>, but I could never imagine trying to play this with my actual family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it initially launched at Target, The Sims Board Game is currently available to preorder from Amazon with an August 15 release date. If you feel like giving it a try, it is actually pretty reasonably priced at $19.99.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 7, 2025 11:18 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-board-game-nobody-asked-for-was-quietly-released-at-target-last-month]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2xko-lead-champion-designer-talks-vi-and-the-changes-coming-in-the-closed-beta-evo-2025.1265262/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">2XKO has been a staple of Evo for the last three years, but the finish line (or perhaps the true starting line, depending on how you look at it) is finally starting to come into view on the horizon. A closed beta has been announced for September 9, and after that, the servers will remain up all the way until launch, whenever that may be. The game has changed a lot since it's first iteration, and even since its first appearance at Evo, and there are even more changes in store for the Closed Beta. To cover some of these changes, and to get a breakdown of the newest character, Vi, I talked with lead champion designer Alex Jaffe, after going hands-on with the latest build for myself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You’re launching a closed beta on Sept. 9 and have announced that the servers will remain live until the game launches. First off, how does that feel? Can you sum up what you're feeling at this significant milestone in 2XKO's long life at this point?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Jaffe, Lead Champion Designer on 2XKO: </strong>I appreciate you asking, because it's very much an emotional thing for so many of us. We've been working on this game for a long time. I think people know. People have been waiting, right? We get it. We are the same way. We just want people to have the game. We just want them to play. And, years of my life, I have just been waiting for this moment, right? So when you make a game, you're there to bring joy to people.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We've been working on this game for a long time. I think people know. People have been waiting, right? We get it. We are the same way. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And so, we knew that we were heading towards the closed beta, but the day we announced it, I got to tell you, my spirit's lifted in a way they haven't in a while, because it just feels so real now. And, having people here at EVO playing it, everybody signing up for the beta, soon they're going to have it home and they're not going to have it taken away from them again. They're going to have it. And they're just going to keep on playing forever, hopefully. And I just cannot wait to have more and more people playing the game, and hopefully having a great time with it, and learning from them, and improving the game for all y'all, hopefully.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I'll tell you what, as someone who played the Alpha Lab, and then had it taken away from them, I did feel like it was a major slight against me.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jaffe: </strong>Absolutely. We're just practicing a little bit of cruelty just for no good reason. No, I'm just kidding. No, we know there's work to do, right? If you played Alpha Lab, hopefully you had a fun time with the game. But, there was a lot that was incomplete. And we have been grinding, we have been in the lab working on the game, so many little details, trying to add more content, but also, I was looking at the changes that our core rules team and our live balance team put in, just in Alpha Lab 2, and it's just massive. So many problems are being fixed. So many good solutions to make more situations in the game more interesting, more fair. I'm just so proud of everyone on the team.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Well, let's talk about those changes since Alpha Lab 2. What were some of the major pieces of feedback? I know you can't go through every little bit. But what are some of the major bits of feedback that you got from Alpha Lab 2 that you're addressing in this closed beta?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jaffe: </strong>Yeah, absolutely. And I'll speak first about core roles, which is not my team, but it's the team I work very closely with, of course, because I work on Champions. So one of the things we saw in Alpha Lab 1, we saw that the game was really long combos, a lot of pressure, just like it was hard to get your turn. It was hard to get agency and get to act. And again, you want to play the game. At the same time, a lot of it is about taking control and being able to style on your opponent. Finding that build or middle ground is what we've been working on. Alpha Lab 2, in some ways, we swung the other way, right? It was too hard to get your offense started, unless you knew very, very specific routes to get Oki, for example.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>[Editors Note: Oki, or okizeme, is a term used to refer to the offensive options you can use while the opponent is getting up off the ground after a knockdown]</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, I know the combos were too short there, but there were ways in which people felt like there was maybe some overcorrection. And I think, we really hit a great sweet spot in this one. So some of the changes we made, we improved damage, so that rounds don't go on so long. People were just like, "I want to get through the round. Finish the game, get into another one." But, there was maybe too much healing, not enough damage, we have less gray health building. All these things to make sure that a round is fun, fast, and gets to the point. We also changed the way our knockdown system works, so that it's possible to get really, really offensive mix-ups and set ups on your opponent. But they're not freely available as a vortex where you combo into it over and over and mix up. We have our throws forward throws and air throws. They're hard knockdowns. But, you don't get a hard knockdown off of combos anymore. You do get these roll opportunities. You used to have rolls in there, but now, the rolls can be thrown to be punished. So roll doesn't get you out of pressure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So a lot of just somewhat subtle maybe to an unfamiliar player, but really, really central to someone who's playing the game hard in terms of making sure that it's fair and interesting. Oh, meter changes too, one more thing I want to mention. Pretty big. You start the round with one bar of meter, so you can just get going, and hit your super, and get right to the fun stuff. You don't start with a full bar of your team meter anymore, which is your break. So you can't break that first combo that your opponent's doing to you, right? We want to make sure you get your combo in, you're not just waiting for the second one. So it's all a lot of tuning. It's all subtle stuff. But I think it just results in more fun games that go quicker where there’s more back and forth between players.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">2XKO - Braum Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Let's talk about Vi. Vi Is the new character that you just introduced. And, I got to play with her. She's super fun, very much my style of character.</strong> <strong>As someone who plays Giovanna in Guilty Gear Strive, I just love being able to quickly dash in and out. What is Vi's kit, basically? What was the idea that you wanted to hit with this character?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jaffe: </strong>Absolutely. Yeah. So Vi is a character that is really, really beloved, even before Arcane, right? League players love her. But Arcane really brought her into these upper echelons of iconic characters. And, obviously, we looked at her, her power is in her fists, right? And we knew that there was a good chance she would be somewhere in the boxer zone. Boxers are just a classic archetype in fighting games. But we wanted a new twist on it and we were just really looking at what we could do with her.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And for us, it was really about getting some of that technicality of boxers, where really precise movement, a lot of really interesting strings, but also, some of that just raw power fantasy of these Hextech gauntlets, right, just mashing your opponent with huge hits, hitting the ground, making blasts of energy, and tying those two things together, I think, weaving them together was the goal. And, it took a while to get there. We definitely went through many iterations on her before we found that perfect sweet spot. But we were super happy with... I think, what that lets you do is it lets you make a character that's easy to get into, because you're like, "Damn, she hits hard." Right? Very much from the beginning, right? She's smashing you to the ground, charging up that S1 punch, and hitting you for full stream.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The real core of Vi's kit is her footwork.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But, the real core of her kit is her footwork, which is this dashing special you mentioned, where you can weave in and out and you can cancel it into different follow-ups. And these follow-ups have so much flexibility. You can charge one and then not charge the other, charge another, cancel charge one into any other S1 special, link that into another footwork, and you've got this really nice dance for combos and her pressure structure, I think, look just really beautiful and feel really expressive and great on the hands. Yeah, I'm super proud of her. It seems like people are having fun time with her out here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One of the things I noticed about her is that she is so fast, blisteringly fast. It's already a very fast game. Her mix-up or cross-up potential is super, super high. What would you say are some of her weaknesses though? It seemed like she might have some trouble getting in on somebody who's trying to zone her out.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jaffe: </strong>Yeah, absolutely. And we do have tools to deal with that, but the idea is, look in a game 2XKO, there's a lot happening. There's a lot of hit-boxes on the screen. Everybody has to have some way to... We talk about just get their **** started. You know what I mean? I'm sorry. But, yeah. So that means sometimes it means projectiles, right? You're casting power across the screen. Sometimes it means, "Hey, I've got armor to go through." Right? Like Darius's reversal. And sometimes, it just means “I'm so fast that you can't even prepare for my approach.” And that's definitely Vi’s strong suit, it’s surprising movement, getting right in there, but she has to make it through whatever the battery of defenses. And, she does have some projectile invulnerability to do that. But yeah, it can be challenging. Even I was playing a set with someone today, and her footwork dash can go into a slide that crosses up. You saw that, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yeah, yeah.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">She just passes through. And I was playing with someone who was just mashing jab when I started to go into it. And, I'm screwed there, right? If your opponent knows what you're doing predictably, there are really strong answers to Vi. You have to keep it flexible. You have to use some of her unorthodox air tools to change her movement up. You got to be using back and forth movement, not just all aggression. So definitely, she is a very strong character, but she's fighting, in some ways, inherently an uphill battle against characters with bigger hit-boxes or with projectiles.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So the landscape of the tag-fighting genre has changed substantially in just the last year.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jaffe: </strong>Oh, has it? What happened?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">[Laughter]</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I just wanted to get your thoughts on the genre and what it feels like. You used to be the new kid on the block, the only kid on the block.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jaffe: </strong>Now we're the old new kid on the block. I get it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And now, all of a sudden, all these kids have moved in.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jaffe: </strong>Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What's that feel like?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jaffe: </strong>Honestly, it's exciting in a real way, because everybody on this team loves tag fighters, and there were a jerk of options for a while. And, we're making this game because we think that this is one of the most mind-meltingly enjoyable experiences you could have on planet Earth. And so, we're genuinely psyched that there are more options out there and that there are going to be more people playing tag fighters on account of multiple games coming out. And it's really cool just seeing them, everyone's taking very different takes on it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We're genuinely psyched that there are more options out there and that there are going to be more people playing tag fighters on account of multiple games coming out. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Tokon folks were super nice and welcomed us in to play this morning, me and another designer, Caroline. We only played and we had a great time. The game's very different than ours. The pacing is different. The way team play works is very different. I think there's both room to enjoy both of them, or just different audiences will like different ones. So I feel great about that. I haven't got to play Invincible. Yeah, super excited to play that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It's super fun.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jaffe: </strong>Yeah, and Hunter x Hunter is awesome. So it's a wild time from there to be so few, to now, so many. But, I think, it's inevitably going to bring a lot of people into this kind of peak experience. So we're excited, and we want people to play our game, and enjoy it, and in general, to play tag games to enjoy them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Coming back to the closed beta, do you have any sense of how long you want this closed beta to last? Or is it just a thing of when you feel like the game is ready, that's when you're going to flip the switch?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jaffe: </strong>Yeah, it's a great question. I don't think I have a very satisfying answer there, for two reasons. One, because I personally don't know exactly what the plans are at the top level in terms of how we do that, because I'm working on making the game. That's my focus, right? And in particular, as running the champions team, it's all about that character factory, making one amazing character after another to the extent we can. That's our goal, right? So my eyes and my team's eyes are firmly set on the next character, the one after that, and the one after that, just making them amazing. In terms of the process, what we're going to learn from the closed beta, I'm sure that's the goal, right? We want to see how the game does out there. We want to see how people enjoy it, what works and what doesn't.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mitchell's Favorite Fighting Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And, I'm sure I could say that the duration of it does depend on how confident we are with what we've got. So far, we're loving what we have here, but it'll be different once people have it at home. That said, I don't actually even know exactly what the bounds of how short or how long that could be are. I'm sure somebody else does, but no matter what, we don't want to wait too long, right, before expanding the game as much as we can, because we just want it out there, we want people playing it. And, how long it'll be, I can't say really. But, fingers crossed, not too long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Final question. For anyone that played the first two Alpha Labs, maybe felt like they had a good feel of their character, are they going to jump into this new closed beta and be like, "Oh, this is way different"? What are some of the biggest changes to some of the other characters that are going into the closed beta?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jaffe: </strong>Absolutely. Yeah. So we have a lot of changes on the rules side and some more strategic changes on the champion side, as well as some tuning. It's actually cool because we've had our live balance team start coming online and start participating in the process of working on the Champions, because in some sense, we're doing live balance on champions that have actually existed in the wild for a while, even though it's only been in temporary tests. So they're working on the champs and collaborating with the champion designers, like our live balance designer, Yohosiei, to just make them more pristine. And, some of the change is damage, whatever, recovery. But some of them are more significant. Darius?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Darius has a fireball now!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jaffe: </strong>Darius got a projectile. It's got a nice little ground projectile. It's not the strongest thing in the world, but it has real strengths. He can use it to approach. He can combo off it sometimes, OTG (off the ground) with it. It just gives him more tools to play with to be a more full and expressive character so he can have more fun with him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Illaoi, we're very excited about a subtle change. Illaoi, she really relies on getting her tentacles out to start her game. Because once she's got tentacles, she can pressure with them, she can combo with them, she can mix the opponent up with them. But, we wanted her to have that physicality, so she can't just summon them. She has to hit you to generate tentacles. That said, it was really hard for her to start that game from far away, like we talked about. So we found a great compromise, which is her down S2 is now chargeable. Her down S2 is the move where she punches her totem into the ground and a tentacle comes up and it generates a tentacle for. Now, if you charge that, it will auto-track the opponent's position. So they have to fear that low from anywhere on screen if they're being patient and just sitting there. So it lets her express power from far, get the tentacle out and really get her game going.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You might have to relearn a couple of things [in the closed beta], especially at the advanced level, but you're going to be able to get in there and play your character mostly as you used to. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, just a lot of tuning changes. Yasuo has pretty different routes in a bunch of places. But most characters, Darius, or Braum, Jinx, their routes are pretty similar. Some changes around the way corner. But mostly, you might have to relearn a couple of things, especially at the advanced level, but you're going to be able to get in there and play your character mostly as you used to. And, we're making bigger swings right now. But as we get closer and closer to the whole complete version of the game, we're going to slow down that rate of change, so that we're not disrupting people's muscle memory too much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

We wanted to assure players that Turn 10 and Playground Games will continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon… <a href="https://t.co/0PPLgo44aP" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/0PPLgo44aP</a></p>— Forza Motorsport (@ForzaMotorsport) <a href="https://twitter.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1953508994581938364?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">If it seems like a bit of a no-brainer that a studio would support its own, most recent games, it unfortunately wasn't. This statement comes exactly a month after reports that Turn 10 was gutted during a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">massive layoff across Microsoft</a>.

One former employee said that the studio was still open to supporting Horizon, but that the Motorsport side had been fully closed down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox has yet to make any kind of statement one way or the other as to what happened to Turn 10, what's going on at Playground, or who exactly of those studios is the one posting on Twitter/X saying it will continue to support both games. Notably too, the post doesn't say anything about future game development. Forza Motorsport is currently just two years old, but Forza Horizon 5 came out in 2021 and fans are feeling about due for another entry. It's unclear whether or not they'll get one, whether Motorsport will ever see another entry, or if the two Forza teams have been whittled down to mere support on existing games until they can't any longer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This post also comes alongside updates to a few other Xbox-supported games. We learned today that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-stops-development-on-contraband-four-years-after-initial-e3-announcement">Xbox canceled Avalanche Studios-developed Contraband</a>, but we also learned that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kojimas-od-still-in-development-despite-xbox-game-cancellations">Hideo Kojima's OD is still being worked on</a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox">Everwild</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">Perfect Dark</a> were both revealed to be canceled one month ago, during the layoffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-the-final-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ninja-gaiden-4-the-final-preview.1265253/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Let me take you on a quick journey back to the past for a second. It’s the early 2000’s, years before a little game called Dark Souls would forever change the landscape of the action and action RPG genres. It was a time mostly without stamina bars; a time when style, spectacle, and creative expression of combat ruled above all else, a time when games like God of War 1 and 2, Devil May Cry 1 and 3, and God Hand blazed the trail for others to follow. But if you ask me, there was one game that stood above all of them, a masterclass of action design, that challenged and thrilled the teenaged me with aggressive enemy AI, gorgeous visuals, and the most dazzling combat system I’d ever seen. That game was Ninja Gaiden… (and later Ninja Gaiden Black.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I made a whole feature on why I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU09kIVYyIc&amp;pp=ygUVbmluamEgZ2FpZGVuIGJlc3QgaWdu" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ninja Gaiden is the pinnacle of the action genre</u></a>, so I won’t spend too much time on that here, but the point of all of this preamble is to say that my expectations coming into Ninja Gaiden 4 were <em>massive. </em>And yet somehow, based on the four chapters of this preview build, it is living up to them. This is exactly what I’ve always wanted a modern Ninja Gaiden game to be.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is exactly what I've always wanted a modern Ninja Gaiden game to be. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s get one thing out of the way first, while this is co-developed by Platinum Games, make no mistake, this feels like Team Ninja’s Ninja Gaiden, through and through, regardless of whether you’re playing as Ryu Hayabusa or newcomer Yakumo. There’s no split of Yakumo’s levels feeling like a Platinum Games protagonist and Ryu’s feeling like traditional Ninja Gaiden. The two do have distinct playstyles and movesets, but you’ll be doing a lot of the same tricks with both characters, from izuna drops, to guillotine throws, quick charge ultimate attacks, etc. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where Platinum’s influence is truly felt is in the absolutely wild segments in between bouts of combat. One level felt like a demonic 3D Sonic stage as I had to bounce between physics defying rails while avoiding getting shot by a helicopter, using my grappling hook to pull myself from rail, to rail, to wall, back to rail, finishing off with a dramatic leap into an assassination from above to kickstart the next combat encounter. It was just one of the many times I grinned like a giddy little child, laughing out loud, and shouted “that was so sick!” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to the fundamentals of combat, Ninja Gaiden 4 feels like an even better version of Ninja Gaiden 2. You’ve got light attacks, heavy attacks, shurikens, and of course, the signature flying swallow attack that allows you to quickly dash towards an enemy out of a jump and potentially slice their head right off with just a single strike. New to Ninja Gaiden 4 is a powered up form for both Yakumo and Ryu, accessed by holding down the left trigger, that allows them to use slower but much harder hitting attacks, fueled by a meter that is filled primarily by landing hits with your base form and by using obliteration techniques on dismembered foes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll need to use this form primarily to break through an enemy’s guard once they start blocking your standard attacks, or to guard against one of the many especially powerful red glowing attacks that some larger enemies and bosses like to use. Yakumo’s Bloodraven form allows him to use a giant blood sword that extends and allows for some really cool looking attacks that hit a wide area, while Ryu’s Gleam Form allows him to use the kinds of multihitting high speed sword slashes that you'd normally get from charging up an ultimate technique. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's the small touches and improvements that really made me fall in love with Ninja Gaiden 4's combat.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s the small touches and improvements that really made me fall in love with Ninja Gaiden 4’s combat. The way that Guillotine Throws now home in on enemies and can be used to knock airborne foes out of the sky; the way you’re now more encouraged to use the environment to your advantage thanks to powered up flying swallows when you use them out of wall runs; how you can now use quick charge ultimate techniques right after landing from an Izuna Drop or Flying Swallow; or the way you can use your grapple to zip up to flying drone, leap off them, land two strikes on a flying enemy, and then literally yank them out of the air and piledrive them into the ground. This is exactly the kind of substantial, but ultimately iterative upgrade to the classic style of Ninja Gaiden’s combat that I had hoped Ninja Gaiden 3 would be.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mitchell's 25 Best Games of All Time</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the thing I was most delighted about though was that Ninja Gaiden 4’s boss battles, or at least the two that I’ve played so far, are excellent. Outside of a small handful of exceptions, bosses have never been a particularly strong suit of the series, but right out of the gate the first boss, a large samurai armor clad enforcer, was a satisfying test of my skills, reflexes, and pattern recognition. It was an intense one-on-one fight against an enemy that was reactive to what I was doing. He would parry my attacks and follow up with a quick counterattack of his own, if I stood too far away he would quickly close the distance and bring the aggression to me, he would sneak in unblockable attacks to simultaneously threaten and provide me with an opportunity to stun him by quickly hitting him with an attack out of bloodraven stance. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole fight, and even when I died, I would catch myself smiling at how much fun I was having. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second boss was a little less traditional, as after our first encounter she fled, leaving me to chase her throughout a distorted demon hellscape, but the actual battle itself was no less impressive. She wielded a giant umbrella that she would twirl around continuously, forcing me to be precise with my blocks whenever she got close. Another thing I appreciated about both these fights were the grapple points that I could use to quickly zip out of the way, and then flying swallow right back in to keep up the aggression. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo gave me a ton of skills unlocked right from the start, and while that was very much appreciated in the sense that I had Ryu and Yakumo’s full set of tools available for me to play around with, it also didn’t give me a good sense of what the progression will be like in the full game, and how much of that arsenal Ryu and Yakumo start off with. Which is something I’m very much looking forward to figuring out when I get my hands on the full version. At the very least I can say that the training and tutorial tools in Ninja Gaiden 4 seem excellent. There’s a full training mode where you can practice against customizable enemies, you’re able to look back and get explainers with video on every technique you’ve learned, full combo lists, the whole works. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While levels are linear and I didn’t happen to find any golden scarabs or crystal skulls, there are still things to find and do off the beaten path. There are terminals throughout the level that come with sub missions, such as defeat X number of enemies in Y location, or locate a number of creatures called Gourdy’s that are gourd shaped fiends that you can capture by completing a quick button press minigame. By far the coolest thing to find though are combat challenge rooms, where you can actually set your health handicap and get a reward based on how hard you make the challenge for yourself. I loved the challenge rooms in the OG Ninja Gaiden 2, so I was super happy to see a form of them return, and the ability to essentially set your difficulty is a cool change that gives you an appropriate reward for the effort you put in. The currency you gain can be used to purchase items and abilities at the shop, but again, I didn’t really have to engage with this all that much in this preview build since most of the things I needed were already provided to me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s rare when you wait for a game for more than a decade and it finally comes and it seems to be everything you wanted and more, but so far, Ninja Gaiden 4 is shaping up to be that game. October 21 can’t come fast enough. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

And our goal here is to make everything exceptional."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bioshock-next">BioShock 4</a> has reportedly been in development for more than a decade at various studios under the 2K Games banner. But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-reportedly-getting-a-narrative-overhaul-amid-development-struggles">it has suffered yet another overhaul</a> after it reportedly failed a review by executives and the head of its developer, Cloud Chamber, was ousted. Now, the fourth BioShock feels further away than ever. So, what’s going on?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview ahead of 2K parent company Take-Two reporting its latest 2025 quarterly earnings, I asked CEO Strauss Zelnick flat out if BioShock 4 was in danger of being canceled. Zelnick was clear in his response: “It’s going to come out,” he promised. “That I can say hand on heart, without question.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelnick sounds pretty confident, then. But it’s hard to get away from BioShock’s tumultuous — and lengthy — development. On this, Zelnick held his hands up, admitting BioShock 4 has had its troubles. But he also explained why it’s proving such a hard nut to crack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We don't talk about how long our development cycles are,” Zelnick began. “We have had some ups and downs along the way. That is accurate. And we have had changes in studio leadership. That said, we have very big shoes to fill on BioShock because of the legacy of Ken Levine, the legacy of what has gone before, which has been so successful. And we need to make sure that this experience is true to the BioShock DNA on the one hand, and a massive step forward on the other hand. That's always challenging. We think we're up to the challenge, but it has not been seamless.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier broke the news of BioShock 4’s overhaul</a>, and offered some insight into its troubles. “The game’s narrative was identified as an area that was particularly in need of improvement and will be revamped in the coming months,” Schreier reported.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In a recent all-hands meeting, Cloud Chamber staff were told that the company needs to become more agile and efficient, leading to worries that layoffs may follow,” Schreier continued.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">BioShock: The Collection Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There hasn’t been a new BioShock game since 2013’s BioShock Infinite (Ken Levine is still working under the 2K banner on Judas). But BioShock 4 is not alone in having a lengthy development cycle, and we’ve seen — very recently — some publishers cancel games that were in development for six, seven, or even eight years. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-concords-failure-and-marathons-delay-sony-admits-playstations-live-service-strategy-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly">Sony’s live service flop Concord</a>, for example, was in the works for years before its disastrous release. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox">Microsoft just canceled Rare’s Everwild</a>, which was revealed six years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is clear from the outside looking in that triple-A video game development is getting longer, which is something Zelnick not only agrees with, but offered an explanation for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it's a reflection of the fact that as entertainment businesses mature, consumers seek quality and everyone realizes that the consumer is highly demanding and properly so,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The strategy of this company has always been to make the best entertainment, not necessarily the most entertainment. Of course, sometimes we've fallen short, but frankly a precious few times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I think some of our competitors have realized maybe a little late in the day that consumers are not okay with okay. Good is the new bad, great is the new great. And our goal here is to make everything exceptional.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelnick added that he didn’t mean to be critical of other video game companies “because this is really hard stuff, and you don't want to criticize someone for sticking with their creative talent, supporting them and trying to get a great result.” But he did say that Take-Two “would like to fail fast if we're going to fail.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And we have made some hard decisions relatively early on. But we too have occasionally canceled titles well into their development. So it's hard. What we're all doing is hard.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2K Games issued the following statement to Bloomberg on BioShock 4:</p><blockquote>We are working hard to set BioShock up for the best possible future. Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, when might we see BioShock 4 actually come out?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

This includes folks who enjoy learning about and experiencing historical events from around the world.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This list highlights some titles that not only are fun to play, but also offer insights and a deeper look at various historical events. Even though these are all fun games, some of the subject matters they tackle may not be right for all gaming groups, so make sure ahead of time that all of your players are fine with the game first, to have the best time you can!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Above, you'll find a side-scrolling list of all the items on this list. But if you want more info about any of the games, keep on reading.</p><p id="watergate"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Watergate">Watergate</h2></p><div catalogid="c0d3b784-f26b-4365-8b66-8362a0bd07dc" id="226597"><div id="226597" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Watergate</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In Watergate, two players take on the roles of either the Press or the Nixon administration during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Watergate scandal</a> from 1972 to 1974. Players use their custom decks of cards to try and secure, or bury, enough evidence to either convict the president if you are on the side of the press, or to finish out your term if you are playing as the administration. Cards are adorned with actual historical photographs and events that took place during this period, with additional blurbs and details that give Watergate an intricate look at what transpired.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game itself is a fun tug-of-war that's also a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">quick-playing board game</a>, with average games only taking maybe a half hour or so. And thanks to its small box, it makes it easy to take with you to the coffee shop, brewery, or on vacation. As an added bonus, the back half of the rule book provides even more information about the people, places, and events that are represented on the cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information on the Watergate scandal, check out this paper from <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Watergate-Scandal" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Britannica</u></a> or this documentary from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV9JT4pZH_o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Timeline</u></a>.</p></div><p id="molly-house"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Molly House">Molly House</h2></p><div catalogid="c0d3b784-f26b-4365-8b66-8362a0bd07dc" id="226598"><div id="226598" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Molly House</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Set during the 18th century in London, Molly House is an exploration of the <a href="https://mollysteinsapir.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Molly community</a> of the era (think LGBTQ+) as they looked to spread joy throughout their community while navigating around the Society for the Reformation of Manners and police. Molly House has players maneuvering around a board, managing cards to grow their reputation, and throwing parties to score points. There is always a danger, however, of constables and rebels trying to tear it all down, so players will also have to work to prevent the various houses from being raided, shut down, and individuals from being indicted. Some players can even choose to secretly become an informer, working against the others and the Molly community, adding a "hidden motive" mechanic to mix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the game itself is a fun and complex game of strategy and bluffing, it's also a game whose subject matter and historical ramifications are worth considering. Molly House showcases actual people who lived and were prominent members of the Molly community at the time, with the rulebook's last few pages dedicated to further elaborating and giving context to the time and people involved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's also a game where "getting hanged" is one of the end-game outcomes, including imagery of a noose. Molly House is a game that highlights both the joy of that community (yay throwing parties), but also the dire situations that members could find themselves in and suffer through. Something to be aware if you are looking to introduce this game to your game night with fellow history buffs!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information on this period and topic, here are two articles from <a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/research/inclusive-heritage/lgbtq-heritage-project/meeting-and-socialising/cross-dressing-and-queer-socialising/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Historic England</u></a> and the <a href="https://blog.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/2020/06/19/18th-century-molly-houses-londons-gay-subculture/#:~:text=18th%20century%20London%20was%20home,they%20met%20up%20in%20secret." data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>British Newspaper Archive</u></a>.</p></div><p id="pax-pamir"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pax Pamir">Pax Pamir</h2></p><div catalogid="c0d3b784-f26b-4365-8b66-8362a0bd07dc" id="226599"><div id="226599" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pax Pamir</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Set during the period that Western historians refer to as “The Great Game,” Pax Pamir has players assume the roles of Afghan leaders after the fall of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durrani_Empire" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Durrani Empire</a> in the 19th century. One of the central aspects of this game is managing your relations with Russia and Britain, who at the time were gain a foothold in the Central Asian region, while also attempting to create your new state. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From a gameplay standpoint, Pax Pamir is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games"><u>strategy board game</u></a> that has you drawing and playing cards in order to perform actions, build your armies, and establish coalitions with groups in an effort to gain dominance in the region. It’s an intricate and surprisingly complex tableau builder of a game with a lot of moving parts that players have to keep their eyes on and work around, to secure a lead of at least four victory points to win.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Inside its box, the Pax Pamir 2nd Edition contains lavish components, including a cloth game board and detailed resin pieces. Perhaps most impressive are the 150+ cards, which all feature archival imagery. In typical Wherlegig style, the back of the rule book contains additional historical information for those who want to know more. The ramifications of the events presented in this game are still felt today, so make sure your players are comfortable with the setting before sitting at the table. </p></div><p id="john-company-second-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="John Company: Second Edition">John Company: Second Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="c0d3b784-f26b-4365-8b66-8362a0bd07dc" id="226600"><div id="226600" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>John Company: Second Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most complex game on this list, John Company 2nd Edition is a game about positioning your family within various roles and using the historically problematic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">British East India Company</a> for your own personal gain. Your characters will inhabit a variety of roles throughout, including the company’s Chairman, Director of Trade, or of Military Affairs, while you try to manage various crises and negotiations in the attempt to build this state-sponsored trade monopoly. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game has you guiding the company as opposed to letting you directly control it, as most games would. Turns consist of retiring family members, choosing how they will invest in the company, hiring for new positions, and accepting bonuses, and moer. The game is a lot, with a lot of moving parts, making John Company a title you probably would only want to introduce to a seasoned group that's comfortable with complex board games. Still, when you figure it out, it's a game whose web of systems results in a thought-provoking experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">John Company is also a game that doesn’t try to mask or hide the themes of imperialism, globalization, or colonization that the British East India Company took part in. Playing this game can stir conversations, but the subject matter may be heavy for some players around your table.</p></div><p id="memoir-44"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Memoir '44">Memoir '44</h2></p><div catalogid="c0d3b784-f26b-4365-8b66-8362a0bd07dc" id="226601"><div id="226601" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Memoir '44</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you and a friend enjoy World War II and find yourself with a couple of hours of free time, then Memoir ‘44 is a game to check out. This tactical grid-based <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war game</a> puts one player in the boots of allied forces and the other in the Axis, roughly recreating specific battles that took place during the war. Utilizing card-based movement and three regions of combat to assign orders to, Memoir is relatively easy to pick up and teach, but offers plenty of room for strategy. It also has numerous expansions to not only increase the number of players it allows but also the number of scenarios you can play out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned previously, the different battlefield scenarios you can set up and play are based around actual battles, and accompanying each setup guide are historical details of it. These include both the name and date it occurred, which is a neat inclusion, so if you are interested, you can look up additional details after playing.</p></div><p id="omert-the-five-families"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Omertà: The Five Families">Omertà: The Five Families</h2></p><div catalogid="c0d3b784-f26b-4365-8b66-8362a0bd07dc" id="226602"><div id="226602" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Omertà: The Five Families</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Omertà: The Five Families takes players back to 20th-century New York City as members of five of the most powerful mafia families of the time as they work to push out their competition and secure territory. Included in the box are nine scenarios that highlight various years from 1905 to 1985, including events such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Mafia_War" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Second Mafia War</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana_Conference" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Havana Conference</a>, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castellammarese_War" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Castellamerse War</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game itself is an area control title where each player moves their forces around Manhattan, Brooklyn, and New Jersey, playing cards to take actions, gain respect, and unfold the story. As you can expect, though, sometimes violence is required, so players can expect some fighting too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For fans of mafia history, or just the period of New York, Omertà provides you with a more historical approach, one that isn’t tied to a film or other series, and is more rooted in moments in history. The variety of scenarios also does a good job mixing things up, with different victory conditions and setup alterations, helping keep the game feeling fresh, longer.</p></div><p id="votes-for-women"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Votes for Women">Votes for Women</h2></p><div catalogid="c0d3b784-f26b-4365-8b66-8362a0bd07dc" id="226603"><div id="226603" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Votes for Women</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In this asymmetrical card-driven area control game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/votes-for-women-board-game-review">Votes for Women</a> puts one to four players in the roles of either the Suffragists or members of the Opposition in the campaign to pass the Nineteenth Amendment. Players will be playing cards and trying to win the support of enough states around the United States to secure a victory for their side. The suffragists need 36 states to ratify and win, while the opposition only needs 13 states to reject it to win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Votes for Women showcases artwork and imagery from the period and movement, including posters and other propaganda used during this contentious moment. As an extra bonus for fans of the period, Votes for Women also includes a number of document replicas, including stories from the August 19, 1920, issue of the New York Times and a supplementary designer notebook detailing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information about the suffrage movement, check out this article over at the <a href="https://www.theworldwar.org/learn/about-wwi/womens-suffrage" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>National WWI Museum and Memorial site</u></a> and this short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ERshnPxI8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>documentary from LucasFilm</u></a>.</p></div><p id="twilight-struggle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Twilight Struggle">Twilight Struggle</h2></p><div catalogid="c0d3b784-f26b-4365-8b66-8362a0bd07dc" id="226604"><div id="226604" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Twilight Struggle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Set during the events of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cold War</a> from 1945-1989, Twilight Struggle has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two players</a> facing off, playing cards and struggling to gain control of regions around the map, while reducing the influence of the other. Both sides draw and play cards that can be used either for a specific effect or for action points they can use to perform various actions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cool twist is that the cards (which are broken into Early War, Mid War, and Late War decks) can lean towards North America, the USSR, or neutral. And if you have to play a card that is geareed toward the other side, you may get the action points but your opponent gets the beneficial effect. Depending on the actions that players take and in what regions, it may lower the Defcon rating, pushing the world closer to Nuclear War and instantly losing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the Cold War buffs out there, the cards that you play – similar to those in Watergate earlier on this list – feature real photographs and mention of events that transpired during the war. For even more details, the back of the rulebook features more robust descriptions and breakdowns of the events the cards represent, which is a really neat touch.</p></div><p id="axis-allies"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Axis &amp; Allies"><strong>Axis &amp; Allies - Various Theater Games</strong></h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Axis &amp; Allies franchise has been around for more than four decades, letting wargame aficionados command the forces of the Allies and Axis powers during the World Wars. While the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/axis-allies-40th-anniversary-edition-board-game-review">mainline games</a> offer a fun representation of the wars themselves, for those looking for something more specific, the series also features a variety of games set around specific encounters in World War II. These games tend to have their own little tweaks to the traditional A&amp;A gameplay but still maintain the same rich strategy gameplay, just on a smaller, more intimate scale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some games are out of print, Renegade Games is doing a great job with the brand, not only creating new entries like A&amp;A North Africa but also reprinting previously out-of-print games like A&amp;A Battle of the Bulge, Guadalcanal, and Stalingrad. These are excellent options and may be of more interest for historical war buffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.
