Microsoft acquired ZeniMax Media for $8.1 billion in March 2021 and operates it under the Microsoft Gaming division.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúVideo games have been the revenue titan of the entire entertainment industry for years, and the workers who develop these games are too often exploited for their passion and creativity," said Jessee Leese, a member of the bargaining committee.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Organizing unions, bargaining for a contract, and speaking with one collective voice has allowed workers to take back the autonomy we all deserve. Our first contract is an invitation for video game professionals everywhere to take action. We‚Äôre the ones who make these games, and we‚Äôll be the ones to set new standards for fair treatment.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ZeniMax QA workers <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-zenimax-media-sees-300-qa-workers-unionize">first unionized in January of 2023</a>, following groups at Raven Software and Blizzard Albany, after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-will-recognize-raven-software-union">Microsoft made a public commitment to labor neutrality</a>. However, the road to a contract has been challenging. In November of last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-elder-scrolls-and-doom-workers-go-on-strike-in-protest-at-parent-company-microsoft">workers went on a one-day strike</a>, citing a lack of progress at the bargaining table over remote work protections and allegations that Microsoft was outsourcing QA work without bargaining with the union. Then, in April, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640423/zenimax-union-cwa-strike-authorization-vote" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">workers voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike</a>, again citing concerns over remote work and low compensation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tentative contract is contingent on ratification by the union members in a vote which is expected to be concluded by June 20.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Since then, we've heard very little until <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-remembers-splinter-cell-exists-by-adding-steam-achievements-to-a-12-year-old-game"><u>Ubisoft remembered Splinter Cell existed by adding Steam achievements to a 12-year-old game just a couple of weeks ago</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If we're honest, today's tease doesn't provide much more information ‚Äî we've got a close-up of Sam Fisher's face and a hashtag, Splinter Cell ‚Äî but interestingly, the alt description is a little more revealing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Close-up of Sam Fisher from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-chaos-theory">Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</a>, showing a stern expression with focused eyes, short dark hair, and a rugged beard, set against a blurred high-tech background," the description explains. "He's locked in."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr">üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SplinterCell?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#SplinterCell</a> <a href="https://t.co/Uh47DxdNQu" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Uh47DxdNQu</a></p>‚Äî Ubisoft (@Ubisoft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1928421132438224990?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's also interesting that Ubisoft specifies this screenshot is from Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, and not from the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-remake"><u>Splinter Cell Remake</u></a>, so make of that what you will.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Splinter Cell series is set to sneak back into action with a remake of the classic first game in the franchise, Splinter Cell Remake. We still don't know very much about it other than the new version will be built from the ground up using the advanced Snowdrop engine. Our last meaningful update came in 2022 when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splinter-cell-remake-we-finally-get-an-update-unlocked-571"><u>IGN met with Ubisoft Toronto developers to discuss their design philosophy behind the game</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚Äú20 years later, we can look back at the plot, the characters, the overall story of the game [and] make some improvements ‚Äî things that might not have aged particularly well,‚Äù said creative director Chris Auty at the time. ‚ÄúBut the core of the story, the core of the experience will remain as it was in the original game.‚Äù</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps Ubisoft is priming fans for a Summer Game Fest announcement, but without confirmation, it's hard to know for sure. On the plus side, we don't have too long to wait ‚Äî Summer Game Fest and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-2025-partners-announced"><u>IGN Live</u></a> are right around the corner. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-last-of-us-the-series"><u>The Last of US Season 2</u></a> will be at IGN Live, as well as Sonic Team, Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles 2, Norse: Oath of Blood, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
