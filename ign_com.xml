We are excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and what we can bring to Beat Saber fans who have been on this journey with us over the past [seven] years."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The update stressed that you will still be able to play Beat Saber and have access to all of your previously purchased content, and cross-buy "remains active" between the PS4 and PS5 base game. You can also still buy songs and music packs that were released on or before June 18 — just nothing added to the catalog from today (June 19) onwards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're grateful for the incredible support you've shown us over the years, and we're excited to share what the future holds for Beat Saber," the update concluded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For many players, this feels very much like the final nail in the coffin for PlayStation's VR aspirations, as Beat Saber is still one of PlayStation's biggest VR titles. Fans seem split between laying the blame with Sony and the lack of support its given to its VR headset, and Meta "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beatsaber/comments/1lefzjq/comment/mygk15e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wanting their game to be the best on Quest</a>." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Absolutely baffling decision," said one player on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beatsaber/comments/1lefzjq/comment/myftupw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subreddit</a>. "Beat Saber still regularly tops the sales charts on PSVR1 and 2, I think dropping support for PSVR1 is understandable but not supporting PSVR2 feels like an absolutely insane move given how popular the game is on that platform."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is a massively stupid f***ing decision," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beatsaber/comments/1lefzjq/comment/myg2baf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added</a> another.

In June last year, <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-no-longer-cares-about-the-psvr-2-and-you-shouldnt-either" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android Central</a> reported that Sony made "deep cuts to funding for VR," with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-cuts-investment-in-vr-development-only-two-first-party-vr-games-currently-in-development-report">only two first-party PSVR2 games allegedly in development</a>. Sony eventually gave PSVR2 a new lease on life by adding PC VR support, but mentions of the device have been few and far between since. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/does-the-new-playstation-vr2-deal-finally-make-it-worth-buying"><u>PSVR2 recently dropped to match its all-time low price</u></a> thanks to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-days-of-play-sale-2025-live"><u>PlayStation Days of Play sale</u></a>.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The PlayStation VR2 may seem pricey, given that it costs $150 more than the base PS5 Digital Edition console you’ll need to use it," we wrote when we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-vr2-review"><u>reviewed the PSVR2 on release</u></a>. "Even so, it’s such a quantum leap over the original PSVR in terms of ease of use, visual quality, and immersion that any PlayStation owner who loves VR should upgrade as soon as possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Its 4K HDR OLED screen and excellently tactile Sense controllers are the most obvious improvement, but plentiful quality-of-life changes and the raw horsepower of the PS5 set a new standard for how VR games should play and feel on console. The downside is that, like any new platform, its thin launch lineup makes its lack of backward compatibility with original PSVR games a significant problem, but one that will only improve as Sony and other developers roll out new games that take advantage of the PSVR2’s unique features."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
