The emergence of a playlist for 10v10 might be what has most frothing at the mouth, though, as it offers bigger lobbies across many of Black Ops 6’s Multiplayer maps. Included in the list of maps is Nuketown, a map that is already notoriously chaotic in 6v6 matches, so expect even more chaos when hopping in for 10v10. While the standard Nuketown 24/7 playlist option will remain, fans can also now enjoy a new Stakeout 24/7 playlist.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/ss-0d3fffebfd9343ff4233a87967a6f63cc81757a5-1920x1080-1730718138609.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 patch nerfs Recon and adds 10v10 playlist.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another highlight involves an additional nerf for Recon, which has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-nerf-a-perk-so-overpowered-some-call-it-a-wallhack"><u>a common complaint from players</u></a> for weeks. The Perk combo bonus gives players a few advantages in combat, including the ability to briefly see enemies through walls after spawning. The effect previously lasted for a whopping two seconds, with many drawing comparisons between it and unofficial cheats like wallhacks. It didn’t take long before Treyarch brought down that timer to only 1.5 seconds, and as promised, that’s now down to only one second with today’s patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Multiplayer regulars will notice that they are no longer able to exit the map in Lowtown, too, with other more general changes tackling stability and XP earn rates. Zombies received a number of tweaks as well, including fixes for a few glitches and a patch for a Tactical Raft exploit that was being used to make the vehicle airborne on Terminus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s Black Ops 6 patch is smaller than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-november-patch-notes-detail-spawn-logic-fixes-and-assault-rifle-balance-updates"><u>some of the others we’ve seen this past week</u></a>, but that’s only because Treyarch is on the verge of dropping <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-revealed-details-on-maps-weapons-and-more"><u>a gargantuan Season 1 update</u></a> next week. We learned more about the inaugural season of content just yesterday, with the team promising that more Multiplayer maps, Zombies additions, and a revamped Warzone will arrive next week. Even more goodies will come with a mid-season refresh in the future, too, with Ranked Play also set to drop later this month.</p><div id="black-ops-6-tier-list-best-guns-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Black Ops 6 Tier List: Best Guns Ranked</h3><h3>Black Ops 6 Tier List: Best Guns Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 got off to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record">a great start</a> when it launched for PC and consoles October 25, and we think its success is deserved.
