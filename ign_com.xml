            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Scarlet and Violet prices are taking off</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet and Violet base set prices have been anything but steady lately, with some Illustration Rares climbing fast while SIRs cool off just as quickly. I’ve been tracking a handful of cards that stood out this month, with some pulling in surprising gains and others dropping harder than expected. Here’s a quick look at which Pokémon TCG cards are crashing and climbing ahead of the final Scarlet and Violet sets release in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed">Black Bolt and White Flare</a>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/14/pixel-9-55-1752506840543.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been keeping an eye on Scarlet and Violet base set prices lately, and the Psychic-type Illustration Rares seem to be the ones pulling ahead. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXBEO?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ralts 211/198</a> has been quietly climbing. It's sitting around $38.99 now, which is up about 28% this month. For a Basic card with simple art and a single Psyshot attack, that's not something I saw coming. Same goes for <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yDxGw?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kirlia 212/198</a>. It's up to $27.99, mirroring Ralts's percentage jump. That evolution line seems to be gaining popularity as a set, more than just individual play value.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of evolutions, <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpW7v?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gardevoir ex 245/198</a> is definitely riding that same wave. It’s hit $54.99 recently, up from $41.19 just a month back. I don’t play Gardevoir myself, but the Psychic Embrace ability keeps showing up in deck lists, so the price hike makes sense when you look at both collector and competitive demand feeding into each other. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObrgE?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Miraidon ex 244/198</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3Gr1m?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Koraidon ex 247/198</a> are seeing their own upticks, both sitting around $23.99 now. Not massive jumps compared to Gardevoir, but steady enough to notice if you’ve been following these since launch. Miraidon especially, thanks to that Tandem Unit ability, looks like it’s still holding value in Lightning-heavy builds.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/14/pixel-9-53-1752506866583.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other end of things, some cards are definitely cooling off. <a href="https://zdcs.link/a03015?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fidough 213/198</a> took a 15% hit, now hovering around $13.74. Cute card, but it doesn’t exactly have a standout ability or attack, so this feels more like a natural correction. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXB57?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Armarouge 203/198</a> dipped too, though only about 11%. I could see it regaining some ground later if Fire decks make a comeback, but for now, it’s sliding. <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEg28J?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pachirisu 208/198</a>’s price drop caught my attention more, which is currently down 19%. I feel like that’s tied to Lightning deck meta shifting around; its no-Paralysis ability isn’t moving the needle price-wise anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/znxNBq?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dondozo 207/198</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpW8r?object_uuid=d86f9963-6cd6-4ec1-838c-a3a13ca74040&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Starly 221/198</a> both saw the sharpest drops, each now at $9.99. Dondozo lost 30% this month, and Starly even more at 37%. I never really saw much hype for either of these beyond early Scarlet and Violet excitement, so the fall-off doesn’t surprise me. It feels like folks are figuring out what’s actually playable or collectible long-term.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Mega Evolution Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is it, the beggining of a new expansion for Pokémon TCG.

There were discounts on quite a few popular games and many <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">popular jigsaw puzzle brands</a> had all-time low prices. But if you happened to have miss all of those deals, Woot is currently having a small sale of its own that gives you a second chance at savings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There aren't a ton of options in this sale, but there are enough to make it noteworthy. Some of the best deals available here are on 3D puzzles and some lesser known board games, so I'd suggest checking those out first. The popular<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-awesome-board-game-and-lego-mash-up-is-steeply-discounted-for-prime-day"> LEGO board game that was on sale during Prime Day</a> was also included, but has already sold out.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Puzzles and Board Games on Sale Today</h2><div catalogid="94d95da3-c3b8-4ab3-9937-c0c55f9b6dd3" id="225302"><div id="225302" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>See All Puzzle and Board Game Deals</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Woot has a landing page for all of the discounts currently offered in its sale, and I recommend you just peruse it yourself to see if there's anything of interest to you. Like I mentioned above, there aren't <em>that</em> many things available in this sale. The board game side of the discounts are especially lacking in some of our favorite options, but there are still some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family games</a> worth picking up in here. The overall best deals are on 3D puzzle builds that are collaborations with popular franchises like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Marvel, and Star Wars. These types of puzzles are excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-alternatives">LEGO alternatives</a> that were already fairly affordable before getting extra discounted here.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What is Woot?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you aren't familiar with Woot, the easiest way to learn more about it is through the <a href="https://www.woot.com/about" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about page on its website</a>. In a nutshell, Woot is a daily deals site that was founded back in 2004 and later purchased by Amazon. They offer deals on just about everything that many other retailers don't often have. The products themselves are always high-quality and backed by Amazon, so it's legit. Prime members even get free standard shipping on anything they buy on Woot, so you don't need to worry about hitting a minimum price or total shipping costs if you already have Prime.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 14, 2025 4:41 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/woot-is-having-a-post-prime-day-sale-on-puzzles-and-board-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you collect Pokémon cards or just like staying ahead of the curve, Best Buy just opened preorders for Pokémon TCG: Mega Evolutions. This set is shaping up to be a big one, bringing back classic mechanics with modern flair, and preorders tend to sell out quickly once word gets out. This also means that other big box retailers should be going live with their preorder allocations soon, so make sure to keep an eye on Target and Walmart below.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the Mega Evolutions preorders, today’s lineup has a few other bangin deals. Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered is down to $48.31 for the Day One Edition on Nintendo Switch, and The Lord of the Rings Illustrated Edition hardcover is sitting at just over $30. If you’ve been eyeing AirPods Pro 2, they’re holding steady at $199, offering great value with active noise cancellation and personalized spatial audio. Let's get into it:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World Tour Bundle for $498.95</h2><div catalogid="36a3b9f5-2ced-42c2-8fd0-f4fa3b4e7cdd" id="223120"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're still on the hunt for a Switch 2 console, here's an opportunity you might want to consider.

This console ships free from a local US warehouse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a genuine gaming console that has been imported from another country (usually Japan, Hong Kong, Canada, or Mexico). Region locking is determined by your account, not by console, so all of these systems will play in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here.

This mirrors earlier trends where less flashy cards gain traction as availability tightens.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Pricing Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a bit of a mixed back for Magic: The Gathering prices this week, so it's always worth double checking eBay before TCG Player and Amazon for a last minute bargain. Also, whoever thinks a Theros Beyond Death booster is worth north of $700 needs to have a word with themselves.</p><p id="yu-gi-oh-early-days-collection-swi"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection (Swi">Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225244"><div id="225244" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up the Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection for Switch and it’s been a solid throwback to the old Duel Monsters days. I grew up playing these games, so jumping back in with the ability to duel online and unlock classic cards feels pretty great. The save-anywhere feature makes it easy to squeeze in a match during a break and come back to it later. I also like that you can rewind or fast forward during duels which makes testing out new strategies a lot more flexible.</p></div><p id="superman-blu-ray-digital"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)">Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225245"><div id="225245" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I was hoping to grab the steelbook edition of Superman but it looks like that’s already sold out. The standard Blu-ray is still available though if you’re just looking to watch the movie without the collectible packaging. James Gunn delivers a Superman story that feels fresh while staying true to the character. There’s a solid balance of action, humor, and heart, and it sets a strong tone for what’s next in the DCU. If you’re into superhero movies that keep things grounded while still feeling big and cinematic, this one’s worth picking up.</p></div><p id="split-fiction-ps5"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Split Fiction (PS5)">Split Fiction (PS5)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225246"><div id="225246" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Split Fiction (PS5)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I grabbed Split Fiction on PS5 recently and it’s been a great pick for co-op sessions. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">We gave it a 9 out of 10</a> and after playing it I can see why. It focuses on split-screen teamwork where you and a partner have to sync your actions to clear each challenge. I really like how each level introduces new mechanics and switches between sci-fi and fantasy settings so it never feels repetitive. Mio and Zoe’s story adds some extra depth too since they do not get along at first but that dynamic makes the whole adventure feel more personal as things ramp up.</p></div><p id="apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-earbuds"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds">Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225247"><div id="225247" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">AirPods Pro 2 are one of those earbuds I keep noticing for their mix of sound quality and thoughtful features. At $199, they offer a strong balance of value and performance. The active noise cancellation blocks out a lot of background noise while adaptive audio automatically adjusts based on your surroundings. You get four sizes of silicone tips for a customizable fit, and once those are set they stay comfortable even through longer listening sessions. The personalized spatial audio and hearing aid features add extra depth, giving them more flexibility than just a standard pair of wireless earbuds.</p></div><p id="dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-switc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switc">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225248"><div id="225248" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake</a> caught my attention for how it brings that classic RPG feel into a modern format. At $34.99, it’s a pretty big discount compared to the usual price, which makes it an easy pick if you’ve been waiting to try it. The HD-2D visuals really stand out with that mix of pixel art and depth that makes the world feel fresh but still familiar. Battles stick to the traditional turn-based system but with small updates like adjustable speed and auto-battle, so it doesn’t feel stuck in the past. The soundtrack ties it all together with that same timeless vibe DRAGON QUEST fans already know.</p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-illustrated-t"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (T">The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (Tolkien Illustrated Editions)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225249"><div id="225249" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (Tolkien Illustrated Editions)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lord of the Rings Illustrated Edition feels like more than just a regular hardcover. At $30.07 it is a big drop from the usual $90 which makes it a sound deal. What really sets this edition apart are the illustrations with Tolkien’s own drawings maps and sketches included throughout. The full text is printed in red and black ink and there are details like sprayed edges and a ribbon bookmark that make it feel more like a collector’s item.</p></div><p id="suikoden-i-ii-hd-remastered-switc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered (Switc">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225250"><div id="225250" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered at $48.31 for the Day One Edition is an essential pickup for JRPG fans. The updated pixel art looks sharp without losing the original style and the new environmental sounds add a little more atmosphere as you move through towns and dungeons.  Fattle fast forward and auto-save features make revisiting these games more modern and easier to play in shorter sessions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
