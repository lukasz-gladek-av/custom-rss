            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Chapter 5 of the popular survival horror game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/poppy-playtime-chapter-5"><u>Poppy Playtime</u></a> just came out, but now fans of the game’s creepy monster dolls are closer to having a Huggy Wuggy of their very own. As part of IGN Fan Fest, McFarlane Toys is revealing some brand-new looks at its line of Poppy Playtime figures. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lineup, which includes 4.5-inch, 7-inch, and 12-inch models, features fan-favorite characters like Huggy Wuggy, Kissy Missy, Killy Willy, and Harley Sawyer. The 7-inch figures will be available for pre-order February 27. You can purchase the entire lineup in stores like Walmart, Target, and GameStop, as well as online at Amazon, BigBadToyStore, Entertainment Earth, and the McFarlane Toys Store this Spring. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I spoke exclusively with Todd McFarlane about his company’s collaboration with Mob Entertainment, producer of Poppy Playtime, and what makes the game the perfect target for collaboration. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/mcfarlane-toys-poppy-playtime-7in-groupshot-01-watermark-1771978500210.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">New Poppy Playtime figures from McFarlane Toys</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“They’re toys,” McFarlane says of the game’s characters. “My job is to just [see] how much accuracy can we get with what is already popular because you're going from a flat screen to something that's tangible in your hand. If you look at Disney, Pixar came up with this idea called Toy Story. We always lean into the strength [of the IP. With Poppy Playtime], you’ve got a popular game people like. They’re based on toys and they look toy-etic so you go, ‘Of course.’ Superman isn't a toy, so you go, ‘Well, let's make one of him.' Freddy Krueger isn't a toy, but you go, ‘Let's make one of him.’ But when you have something that is already in that vein, then you go, ‘Shoot, here we go.’"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McFarlane says that the team felt it was important to offer a variety of options for consumers with different budgets. With the core 7-inch Poppy Playtime figures, the crew at McFarlane implemented a hybrid design combining articulation points with bendable sections to accurately replicate the characters' curved movements from the game. Those figures will include swappable hands and heads, bases that interlink, packaging that can be used as backdrops, and other accessories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Along with the 7-inch figures, 4.5-inch bendy figures will be available that will retail for under $10. Larger 12-inch bendy figures will be sold as well for about $20, which McFarlane says represents the “best value” of the line. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Poppy Playtime Figures from McFarlane Toys</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">McFarlane says that when it came to working out a collaboration with Poppy Playtime, his company’s partnership with Mob Entertainment checked all the boxes. “The Mob guys are a group of people trying to do their passion project,” he says. “In this case, the passion project worked. I like hanging out with people who are a little bit fearless and are willing to take chances. And artistically, they’re cool to look at!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For their part, the team at Mob digs deep into community feedback to determine which characters should get a heavy push when it comes to merchandising. Tyler Sanchez, Senior Social and Growth Manager for Mob Entertainment, is at the center of those efforts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's part of my job really, going in and listening to the fans,” Sanchez says. “Not only when we launch a game, but whenever we put out a new YouTube video. I have entire dashboards of character popularity that I can lean into and then tell our licensing team, ‘Hey, people really really like CatNap! We should focus on making more merchandise for CatNap.' Leaning into what the community wants helps extend the lifetime of the game.”
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond merchandising, Sanchez says that Mob's attention to audience reaction actually can affect how future chapters of Poppy Playtime play out. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was watching a playthrough and they got to the Pianosaurus and saw him eating on the bottom and [the streamer] was just like, 'My boy, I'm so excited.' Pianosaurus turns around and runs and then Doey just takes him and slams him and basically murders him. And [the streamer] said, 'Was that it? Is that forever? Is he dead?' And it was just like this moment where [I thought], ‘Oh god, we're just going to break so many people's hearts by killing this character.’ And so because of that, I actually took it upon myself to write additional lore for Pianosaurus.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond games and a new line of toys, the Poppy Playtime universe is rapidly expanding. Back in 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/poppy-playtime-is-the-latest-horror-video-game-to-get-the-movie-treatment"><u>Legendary Entertainment announced that they were working on a movie adaptation</u></a> of the series. Details of the film are sparse at the moment, but the characters seem ripe for further adaptations. When I asked Sanchez if he could give any hints as to the future of the Poppy universe he demurred. “All I can say is: Stay tuned.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Peyton is the Senior Editorial Director of Events &amp; Entertainment at IGN, leading entertainment content and coverage of tentpole events including IGN Live, San Diego Comic Con, gamescom, and IGN Fan Fest.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s only been a few weeks since the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop"><u>Pokémon TCG’s</u></a> Ascended Heroes expansion made it into the Mega Evolution set, but ten cards in particular have been dominating the singles market more than others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using trading card platform <a href="https://zdcs.link/zE8V7M?object_uuid=d239a6d1-aef3-4d44-9768-77c44233df0e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGplayer</u></a>, we’ve not only been able to find out what the most valuable cards in Ascended Heroes are, but also what the most popular ones are, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although some have been absolute must-buys due to being sought after Illustration Rares with stunning artwork, others have just excelled in the charts due to being amazingly competitive in the current meta. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that, here are the cards that have been topping the early Ascended Heroes market within the Pokémon Trading Card Game, and why players and collectors alike are racing to pick them up.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>#10 – Budew (221/217, Illustration Rare)</strong></h2><div id="235728"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235728" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Budew - 221/217 - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first of the most popular Pokémon cards in Ascended Heroes, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YRder?object_uuid=d239a6d1-aef3-4d44-9768-77c44233df0e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Budew</u></a> proves that even the smallest little Grass-type can make a big impact. While the pastel, dreamlike Illustration Rare artwork by Yoko Hishida has certainly been a draw for collectors, its attack — Itchy Pollen — has almost definitely helped sales, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For no Energy, it deals light damage while preventing Item cards next turn; that makes it a very efficient disrupt that can stall opponent’s strategies even in the early game. It’s efficient, adorable, and well worth the nearly $28 market price Budew has earned for itself at the time of writing.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>#9 – Boss’s Orders [Corbeau] (256/217, Ultra Rare)</strong></h2></div><div id="235727"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235727" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Boss's Orders [Corbeau] - 256/217 - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">An undisputed fan favourite from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a"><u>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</u></a>, Corbeau controlled the Rust Syndicate with class, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/98Abg2?object_uuid=d239a6d1-aef3-4d44-9768-77c44233df0e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Boss’s Orders</u></a> allows him to take control of the board in a trading card match as well — letting you switch in one of your opponent’s bench Pokémon into the active spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a simple effect, but it can delay the flow of your opponent’s strategy enough for you to turn the tables and/or keep the pressure up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, nagismo’s artwork showing off sharp character art and confident pose elevates the presentation (and its rank in the Ascended Heroes sales charts even further), making Corbeau’s powerful stare and style oozing aura and meta competitiveness all the way from your binder.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>#8 – Lillie’s Clefairy ex (280/217, Special Illustration Rare)</strong></h2></div><div id="235726"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235726" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lillie's Clefairy ex - 280/217 - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Given another Lillie’s Clefairy ex topped the charts of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-most-expensive-cards"><u>most expensive Pokémon cards in the Journey Together expansion</u></a>, it’s no surprise the latest version in Ascended Heroes is the eighth most popular card of this new expansion. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only is this card’s illustration of Lillie embracing Clefairy simply delightful, but its ability and attack have some nice tactical weight, as well. Fairy Zone turns Dragon Weakness into Psychic, which can reshape certain matchups entirely, while Full Moon Rondo scales damage based on both players’ Benches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qb8nXo?object_uuid=d239a6d1-aef3-4d44-9768-77c44233df0e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lillie's Clefairy ex</a>, collectors shopping on TCGplayer seem to love the artistic appeal, the overall cuteness factor, and gameplay flexibility; what a winning combination.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>#7 – Mega Dragonite ex (271/217, Mega Attack Rare)</strong></h2></div><div id="235725"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235725" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Dragonite ex - 271/217 - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Essentially the mascot of Ascended Heroes, it’s definitely not a shocker that <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ8V6q?object_uuid=d239a6d1-aef3-4d44-9768-77c44233df0e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mega Dragonite ex</u></a> is another popular Pokémon card on this list. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although much cheaper than the other version below, this Mega Attack Rare’s artwork still stands out in its own right: with a bold and stylised illustration, complete with giant Japanese katakana writing, pops off like an anime episode of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/jojos-bizarre-adventure"><u>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its gameplay capabilities have surely kept it popular, too, as Sky Transport allows once-per-turn switching between Active and Benched Pokémon — enabling fluid positioning that many Stage 2 decks crave.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>#6 – Mega Dragonite ex (290/217, Special Illustration Rare)</strong></h2></div><div id="235724"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235724" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Dragonite ex - 290/217 - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For an extra $500 worth of market value, Pokémon TCG fans have been buying the Special Illustration Rare version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPxbWA?object_uuid=d239a6d1-aef3-4d44-9768-77c44233df0e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mega Dragonite ex</u></a>, which turns the Dragon Pokémon into a whimsical centrepiece. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, using the Ascended Heroes expansion’s love for soft pastel colours and sparkling effects, Dragonite looks transformed into a storybook fairytale creature rather than a Pocket Monster. What’s more, its Sky Transport Ability and Ryuno Glide attack still hit just as hard. Although, we’re assuming buyers are putting a valuable version like this into binders rather than their competitive deck boxes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>#5 – Mega Charizard Y ex (294/217, Mega Hyper Rare)</strong></h2></div><div id="235723"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235723" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Charizard Y ex - 294/217 - ME: Ascended Heroes</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Gems like the golden Mega Hyper Rare cards rarely struggle to find buyers, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/91wbl3?object_uuid=d239a6d1-aef3-4d44-9768-77c44233df0e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mega Charizard Y ex’s</u></a> is no exception. Along with the minimalist golden silhouette giving this card instant prestige, its Y Explosion attack delivers targeted 280 damage to any opposing Pokémon — albeit at the cost of discarding three Energy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of writing, according to its market price, this flashy and powerful card is $425 well spent to a lot of Ascended Heroes collectors among the Pokémon TCG fandom.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>#4 – Mega Gengar ex (269/217, Mega Attack Rare)</strong></h2></div><div id="235722"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235722" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Gengar ex - 269/217 - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like with Mega Dragonite ex’s Mega Attack Rare, this is the Gengar players can actually play without spending what would’ve been enough money to buy a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5"><u>PlayStation 5</u></a>. Mega Gengar ex’s own comic-inspired artwork pops with bold colours and the iconic Ghost-type’s cheeky attitude, giving the card a dynamic feel straight out of a manga panel, which many TCG fans have loved adding to their collections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay-wise, Shadowy Concealment makes <a href="https://zdcs.link/ae8pv1?object_uuid=d239a6d1-aef3-4d44-9768-77c44233df0e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mega Gengar ex</u></a> fun to play with, too, as it reduces the Prize cards opponents take when one of your Darkness Pokémon falls to a Pokémon ex — subtly altering prize trades. Meanwhile, Void Gale hits for 230 and redistributes Energy to the Bench for some tactical flexibility.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>#3 – Psyduck (226/217, Illustration Rare)</strong></h2></div><div id="235721"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235721" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Psyduck - 226/217 - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The third best-selling popular card in the Pokémon TCG’s Ascended Heroes expansion, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aX4d8Z?object_uuid=d239a6d1-aef3-4d44-9768-77c44233df0e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Psyduck’s</u></a> beachside artwork radiates absolute calm, which makes its disruptive effect slightly funny in an ironic way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While its Damp is quite niche, shutting down any Ability that requires a Pokémon to knock itself out, it can still work in certain matchups. Still, the reason TCGplayer customers have jumped on this card is far more likely for everyone’s favourite duck living its most peaceful life in an artificially quaint close-up.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>#2 – Poké Pad (198/217, Common)</strong></h2></div><div id="235720"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235720" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Poke Pad - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Not every bestseller needs to be flashy, with the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLpnRX?object_uuid=d239a6d1-aef3-4d44-9768-77c44233df0e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Poké Pad’s</u></a> ability —  to search your deck for a Pokémon without a Rule Box — being the lone reason it’s the second most popular Pokémon card in Ascended Heroes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s because not only does it give evolution-heavy strategies more consistency and speed, it also fits into so many deck archetypes; with a mere market price of $7.16 as of February 2026, it makes more than enough sense for buyers to snap up multiple copies at a time for different decks.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>#1 – Mega Gengar ex (284/217, Special Illustration Rare)</strong></h2></div><div id="235719"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235719" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Gengar ex - 284/217 - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking the top spot of the most popular card in the Pokémon TCG’s Ascended Heroes is the jaw-droppingly expensive <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yPwYn?object_uuid=d239a6d1-aef3-4d44-9768-77c44233df0e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mega Gengar ex</u></a> in its Special Illustration Rare form. The biggest contributor to it being such a big seller, even with an $800+ market price, is Taiga Kasai’s artwork that bursts with neon chaos — turning Gengar into a looming, mischievous force that dominates the card frame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It carries the same prize-manipulating Shadowy Concealment Ability and energy-shifting Void Gale attack as its alternate version, but the premium art is without a doubt what’s earned Gengar the Ascended Heroes crown in this case, and we expect the popularity to keep going for quite some time. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ascended Heroes - Where to Buy</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

            <guid>1447525</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Universal Fan Fest Nights is returning for its second year at Universal Studios Hollywood in 2026, and, for IGN Fan Fest, we were able to talk to senior director of entertainment production and executive producer Stephen Siercks all about why this night filled with Scooby-Doo Meets Universal Monsters, One Piece, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Harry Potter, colorful Yoshis, and much more is one fans won’t want to miss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tickets are now on sale for Universal Fan Fest Nights at Universal Studios Hollywood, and it will run for 12 nights only; April 23-25, May 1-3, May 7-9, and May 14-16. The after-hours event is separately ticketed, and, alongside the experiences you can read about below, there will be even more character interactions, cosplay and photo opportunities, curated food, beverage, and merch, and the chance to experience many of the attractions available elsewhere in the parks.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/universal-fan-fest-nights-event-key-art-1772117824926.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Universal Fan Fest Nights Returns For an Even More Exciting Second Year</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We began our chat by discussing what makes Universal Fan Fest Nights so special, and Siercks kicked things off by sharing a few words about the event as a whole and why he believes this second year will be even better than the first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the great things about being able to develop these events year to year is that we can innovate and iterate each time,” Siercks said. “What we found really resonated with our fans and guests last year that we're continuing to enhance this year is that level of interaction and engagement. Our guests really wanted a chance to meet their favorite characters, walk through their favorite worlds, and experience their favorite storylines from these different fandoms and genres. So, being able to see that in real time last year gave us a good sense of what we wanted to continue developing for this year's event.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year’s event features some returning favorites and brand-new experiences, and the most exciting one may just be Scooby-Doo Meets The Universal Monsters: Mystery on the Backlot. This will give guests a chance to live out an episode of Scooby-Doo (complete with Fred, Daphne, Velma, and Shaggy!) where Frankenstein, Dracula, Bride of Frankenstein, and Wolf Man are the villains.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/universal-fan-fest-nights-scooby-doo-x-universal-monsters-key-art-1772117842926.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes this experience even more special is that it partially takes place on Universal’s world-famous outdoor film sets, “from the cobblestone streets of Little Europe to the iconic Court of Miracles, the original filming locations for historic Universal horror films Frankenstein (1931) and The Wolf Man (1941).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Firstly, you've got two amazing brands that just were meant to be together,” Siercks said. “Being able to bring together the legacy of Universal Monsters with the nostalgia and playfulness of Scooby-doo was just one of those ideas we had early on and one we were able to bring to life in an exciting way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then you layer on top of that the uniquely Universal part of it, where we get to bring our guests to the backlot and the birthplace of the Universal Monsters <em>and</em> allow them to get off the tram and feel as though they're living a real life episode of Scooby-doo.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of being in an episode, Siercks told me that, as you head to the backlot, you’ll understand why you’re on this adventure and that something awful has happened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Someone has cursed the backlot and brought the Universal Monsters to life, and they are out and about throughout Little Europe,” Siercks teased. “Our job is to support the Mystery Inc. gang and solve this thing. We've got different clues that we have to solve for and interactions that we have to have with the characters - both Scooby-doo and friends and the Universal Monsters - to ultimately, at the end of the experience, go into a small moment where we get a chance, just like in the end of every Scooby-doo episode, to see if we got it right. And there's the iconic moment of the mask coming off the villain and revealing who the suspect was all along. So from start to finish, it truly is a really remarkable, unique aspect of the event.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like experiences like the Back to the Future one at Universal Hollywood’s first Fan Fest Nights, there will also be different things to discover each time you embark on this  mysterious adventure. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You really get to choose your own adventure,” Siercks said. “Each time you're down there, you'll get a different chance to follow a different character or have a different interaction. And we've got some surprises up our sleeves that'll make the actual experience different from night to night. So, you’ll want to come back and solve the mystery multiple times.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That won’t be the only mystery to solve during Fan Fest Nights, as guests will also be able to grab their wands and head to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter for another immersive adventure, but this time it’s set in the Forbidden Forest.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/universal-fan-fest-nights-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter-key-art-1772117896099.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“We're telling a brand-new story and creating a new experience where we're joined by a professor in search of a lost hippogriff,” Siercks said. “As we get deeper and deeper into the forest, we’ll meet different magical creatures and have different interactions that will ultimately result in the ability to find that hippogriff and solve this mission. There’s a level of intimacy there as we’ll be able to tell the story a little bit in more detail and let guests experience the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in a way never before experienced. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And yes, guests are encouraged to bring their wands and cast spells throughout the experience along with our professor as we make our way through the Forbidden Forest.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anime was a big part of the first Universal Fan Fest Nights, and it returns in 2026 in a grander way. In the first year, One Piece fans were able to celebrate their fandom via a fan zone, which took over a street with character meet and greets, scenic photo opportunities, and more. This year, One Piece is actually taking over the WaterWorld show venue with One Piece: Grand Pirate Show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One Piece: Grand Pirate Show is inspired by the one at Universal Studios Japan, but this is a unique and exclusive story and show that was developed specifically for Fan Fest Nights,” Siercks said. “We'll bring our guests that much deeper into the storytelling, be able to meet that many more characters, and have that ability to experience One Piece in a new and unique way.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Universal Fan Fest Nights 2026 - One Piece: Grand Pirate Show</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I asked Siercks where in the timeline this show takes place in, and he mentioned they have decided to pick one arc and focus on that as the core of One Piece: Grand Pirate Show. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've picked a storyline and an arc within One Piece that allows us to introduce those fans who are new to the franchise to the different characters and environments of storytelling, but also at the same time reward those fans who have been there for the long haul,” Siercks added. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After the show, guests are then encouraged to head to the One Piece: Grand Pirate Gathering fan zone to purchase Sanji’s Galley eats and themed drinks, plus photo ops with the Straw Hat Crew!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now it’s time to take a trip to Super Nintendo World, as multi-colored Yoshis will be taking over the beloved land and adding a nice pop to the area. Yoshi was part of the first Fan Fest Nights, but now there will be even more variations for guests to interact with!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This year, our green Yoshi is going to be joined by light blue, pink, yellow, and purple,” Siercks said. “It was a joy to develop this concept even further this year with all these different colored Yoshi's while still weaving through a fun, playful activity along the way that, if we solve the activity, we get an extra special surprise reward at the end of it that we know that guests are going to love as well.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/universal-fan-fest-nights-super-nintendo-world-key-art-1772117923519.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Guests will also receive a clue guide when they enter Super Nintendo World and they must solve the challenge to gain access to a secret location and that exclusive fan reward, which will actually be a Yoshi-themed hat to help celebrate the night. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Siercks also teased that, while this celebration is focused on Yoshi, we may see “special interactions throughout Super Nintendo World that allow us to celebrate some of the other iconic characters as well.” So, make sure to keep a lookout!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Secrets of Waterdeep will once again welcome guests into the beloved fantasy world for a walkthrough experience unlike any other. Secrets of Waterdeeps was one of the top fan favorites of the first Fan Fest Nights, so it was a no-brainer to bring it back for year two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It just made so much sense to be able to bring it back and allow guests who got a chance to see it last year to experience it again,” Siercks said. “And then for those guests who didn't get a chance to experience it, we’re so excited for them to come and take that journey with Evalina and Throckery as they find the Dragon Staff and meet Xanathar the Beholder, who was created by JIm Henson’s Creature Shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve also taken some opportunities to make this experience that much better this year for our guests while honoring the same storyline, the same characters, and the same environments that we're able to bring to life in the first year. We’ve made some minor tweaks and adjustments that fans of Dungeons and Dragons will love to pick out, but they’ll also improve the journey for new guests as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Veterans and rookies alike will also be able to celebrate their victory and enjoy a drink like an Eldritch Blast at Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The First Roll Tavern.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Universal Fan Fest Nights 2026 - Dungeons &amp; Dragons</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can tell, Universal Fan Fest Nights is all about letting fans step into these worlds they hold so close to their hearts. For Siercks, one of his favorite parts of this event is just seeing the joy of the guests as they experience these IPs in a more immersive way than ever before. Sure, these activations are all about being as impressive and entertaining as possible, but they are so much more than that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“My perfect Fan Fest Night is being able to both experience these different offerings throughout the night <em>and </em>finding those opportunities to celebrate the communities of these fandoms as well,” Siercks told me. “One of the most rewarding parts of this event is finding those interactions and moments of engagement between the experiences, where guests can feel they are a part of these worlds. We're bringing these worlds to life around our fans, and that also includes the celebratory moments that lets them celebrate the brands themselves in a way that’s meaningful to them.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a lot of ticket options for Universal Fan Fest Nights, including some that get you into the park during the day before the event. These include General Admission, Universal Express, Universal Express Unlimited, After 2PM Day/Night, After 2PM Day/Night, 2-Night General Admission, Ultimate Fandom Pass, Early Access Ticket, Universal Fan Fest Nights VIP Tour, and Pass Member Special Pricing.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">As our exclusive, all-February-long IGN First "cover story" on the upcoming black-and-white, hand-animated first-person shooter MOUSE: P.I. for Hire continues, we wanted to learn more about the origins of its unique 1930's rubberhose-animated style. And so we sat down with Fumi Studios CEO and Founder Mateusz Michalak as well as Art Director and Lead Animator Michal Rostek to go behind the scenes of this unique game. Read on for a lightly edited transcript of our conversation, or watch the video version below. And you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2416450/MOUSE_PI_For_Hire/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wishlist</a> MOUSE on Steam if you're interested. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: What came first here, the idea for the game itself or the desire and idea to use this 1930s Rubber Hose animation style?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mateusz</strong>: Yeah, I think this is the question more for Michal right now because he was one of the original creators and the guy who created the first art for the MOUSE.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Michal</strong>: I came from the animation industry and I'm really passionate of the animation and especially of history of animation. The MOUSE is like my little passion project that I started inside of my regular animation work. When we started to make video games, I came into the matter with the idea of the boomer shooter with the style of the 1930s Rubber Hose animations, and he loved that idea and give this idea opportunity to make it happen. We started with five people on the small team of this project. Our programmer put a video of making the game on TikTok then it goes viral and resonates all around the world. I remember that day when I was going to work and met my friend in the subway and he told me, "Hey, I read the article, the gaming website, that some guys make a game that looks like the game that you want to make." And I said, "Really?" "Yeah." Then he showed me the article and that was MOUSE.</p><p>"No one ever made an FPS cartoonish game in fully black and white."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mateusz</strong>: Yeah, I can add that from the beginning. It was passion project. We've done most of the work after hours. We started prototyping the game. The first prototype that Michal showed to me was really, really basic. Then we hired a coder/programmer, David, who joined the team and we started the first full small production and the game came out of this small teaser that he showed on TikTok.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: That's cool. So my next question, was it always going to be black and white or was color in this animation? Was that a debate at all amongst the team?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mateusz</strong>: It was never a debate among the team. It was debate in the community because when people first saw the art or the trailer, they thought, "Okay, it's quite original, but you need color." Because no one ever made an FPS cartoonish game in fully black and white. It was something unusual back then, but we sticked with our roots in our original design and we never wanted to add any color. It's challenging. It's really challenging, especially in player guidance, in patch finding because you can always add a yellow color if you have a color in game or any other color, and I think that we've done a pretty good job. It was really, really challenging. We learned a lot of new skills, managing only basically two basic colors, black and white.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Help me understand how much of this, of the animation of the art, was done by hand?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mateusz</strong>: I think all the animations that you can see in the game are done by hand. It's not easy process, but having computers right now, we can speed up some elements in the whole pipeline. Of course, we used techniques from the 1930s, 1940s Rubber Hose techniques. But having computers, we could speed up the whole process. It was much, much nicer and we could basically see our effects not instantly, but quite fast in the game. So if you would use the old techniques, so using paper, pens, scanners, and so on, the whole process would take not months, but years. And in the game development, they don't tend to wait for games, they want games right now. That's why the whole development process of games is shortening every year and we couldn't tell people that, "Okay, you saw teaser, then you need to wait at least 7, 8 years to see the final product." That's why we used computers. And I think Michal can say something more about the whole pipeline of the animation.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Michal</strong>: Yeah, so the animation pipeline is really similar to the pipeline that we use in the animation industry because game is based on animation. So it's really similar but not 100% the same. So for example, we started with the concept that we took from the design department. They're giving us a idea and we made our first concept arts for the character, for the NPC, for the weapons of the game. And then we came to the process that, in the film industry is like a storyboard process when we made a limited animation to put in the game and look how this work.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And if it's good, it comes to the animation process when we put the life on the animations, on the characters, on the weapons and all of the interactive elements in the game. Then to clean up process, when we clean all the outline to not look rough, but to look good, put the colors on it, and the last final step on making animation for the game that is different than making animation for the film is to render all of these things, put it in the engine and pack it and make the magic go on.</p><p>"When they think about MOUSE, they think about animation."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Michal, were the weapons the most fun thing to animate in the game because for me, what I've seen and experienced of the game so far, I mean it's all gorgeous, I just love the entire look, but the weapons, I just love how alive the weapons are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Michal</strong>: Definitely, it was a very fun thing to do, but for me, one of the most challenging things. And we couldn't make such a great design, such a great animations without our two animators and with our two artists, Abraham, who made the great concepts for the weapons on the game and Igor who animated all of the things. So it was also credits for our game design who put all the mechanics, all the specific timing for the weapons to look good because this is one of the things that we need to focus when we making animation for the video game is that it should fit the mechanic, it should fit the interactive aspect of the game and do it in the... right tempo because when you have a game hardly based on the animation, they should look good, but also be useful for the player and not be player shouldn't feel frustration when he uses an animated gun.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: How did the animation influence the tone of the game? It seems to lean a little more playful and I'm just sort of curious how you guys balance that of matching the animation to the tone of the game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mateusz</strong>: Animation, it's crucial for the whole game, so it's connecting also with the whole narrative element. It's like when they think about MOUSE, they think about animation, they think about art and it's a really great thing because we have a hook, we can hook them, interest them in the game. But beneath that, this art animation elements, there is a deep vibrating story and I believe that we'll surprise a lot of people when they will play the game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mouse: P.I. for Hire - Weapon Gifs</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: So you talked about the engine earlier. You guys are using the Unity engine here underneath the animation system. How much custom work had to go into Unity to get it to cooperate with the uniqueness of what you guys are doing with the animation?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mateusz</strong>: The first prototype, however, the first prototype was done in Godot, but the proper development is we are doing in Unity. The unity is really good in managing the 2D animation sprites, it's really good. But our game has thousands of thousands of animations and this was the most challenging part because still, you can put as much assets in the game, 2D assets, as you can, but your game can grow having 200 gigabytes, 300 gigabytes. So the most challenging part was the optimization process of the whole animations and we needed to develop a special tools that will compress 2D animations to have a better performance for the whole level because there is tons of animations, different kinds of animations through the whole level.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Can you talk about, on a similar note about if there were challenges of using 2D animations in a 3D game? We don't see that very often. I imagine that had to present some sort of challenge either in the animation itself and maybe the level design as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mateusz</strong>: I think it would be much easier to make everything in 3D. The most challenging part, managing 2D assets, especially enemies in 3D space is to animate all directions. So we need to animate front, front left, left side, back left, back. All the bosses, all the enemies, every skills, every objects, so not objects, every enemies, bosses and some interactive objects, they are animated in 9 or 8 directions. So it was challenging and really time-consuming. Also, having 3D animations, it's much easier to add every bit of animation to the game. Having 2D animations, we needed to think really carefully what we want to add because we don't want to spend weeks animating things and then we will just delete our work. We wanted to have the whole 2D animations into the foreground, not in the background. So we use flat colors as in the old Rubber Hose animation. So there are all flat colors and you can spot really easily every 2D animation, walking around the level. Either this is enemy or 2D animation objects, interactive objects, you can't really easily spot it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: I have to imagine that this project has been more difficult than maybe you initially thought. And I only say that because I mean making any video game is clearly not an easy thing, but nobody else does this. You guys are the only studio making a game in this way. So how much more difficult, how have you found the process over time? Have you really, I imagine you've learned a lot in the course of development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mateusz</strong>: We made a lot of mistakes, a lot of mistakes. And going back and forth, back and forth with numbers of things. I think that there are few FPS games that using sprites or using to the animations, but I think our project is unique that we are using a lot of frames, a lot of images in our animations to show that the Rubber Hose animation style is really unique and the whole animation is really unique. And I know that right now there is a debate if hand skills not be useful in the future or they will be replaced with some tools. I believe, and I think that we showed it, that having a great hand skills, having a great artist, it's only beneficial for your game and the project itself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: I'm curious as to maybe this might be a good one for Michal, your inspirations for this because Cuphead, I think of very quickly, for obvious reasons, the other really amazingly hand-drawn game, totally different kind of game of course than your boomer shooter, but I also, I get a little bit of Who Framed Roger Rabbit from this too. I'd be curious to hear your inspirations.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mouse: P.I. for Hire – Character GIFs</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Michal</strong>: I think the biggest over overall our inspiration, our biggest inspiration is the Rubber Hose art style as a whole. Our biggest inspiration is the animations from the Fleischer Studios, the people who create such a characters as Betty Boop, Popeye, Coco the Clown, or Bimbo the Dog. Fun fact, we probably watched every available Popeye episode during the pre-production, took the best inspirations for the environments for the characters. But also how they inspired by works of Ub Iwerks. He was a lead animator in Disney. He was animating for example, Steamboat Willie but then he became a solo animator and became a solo career and make characters such as Flip The Frog or Willie Whopper, but also other animation studios for that era. Like for example, Paul Terry, Charles Mintz, but also the old cartoons that were quite violent for that era. But it was a good inspiration for the combat and fight for our game. So we took a lot from them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Awesome. The last question I have for you guys, maybe for either or both of you, so now you're almost there. The game is nearly complete, it's almost out. Moving forward, do you guys want to stick with this animation style for your next project or was this a one-time fun experiment, fun project or is the Rubber Hose animation going to be the Fumi Studio signature moving forward?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mateusz</strong>: I think that the overall hand-drawn style will be our studio signature. I believe in the craftsmen of artists and I think that we will surprise people in the future with our next project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our semi-retired interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <guid>1447519</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> turned 40 years old this week — though Nintendo has sadly done little to mark the occaison. There are no new Zelda games on the horizon, no remakes or re-releases on Nintendo Switch Online, and no sniff of a trailer for next year's ambitious-looking live-action movie. It's a far cry from the array of announcements made for Mario's 40th birthday last year, or the anticipation for Pokémon's 30th celebrations which culminate tomorrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In order to mark the occaison ourselves, then, we tracked down the perfect person to talk about their own role in the Zelda series — the voice of Zelda herself, Patricia Summersett. You'll have heard her voice in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Breath of the Wild</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, plus their Hyrule Warriors spin-off games <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity">Age of Calamity</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Age of Imprisonment</a>. In total, her contributions to the franchise now stretch 10 years — meaning she has been the voice of its princess for a quarter of its life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A fan of the series before her work on it, Summersett previously made headlines when her thoughts on the nature of Link and Zelda's relationship blew up online — a situation she's now said she found angering, while disputing any suggestion that Nintendo itself asked her to intervene and set the record straight. Read on for more about that, her hopes for the franchise's future, Zelda's British accent, and how she originally also auditioned for the Deku Tree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You've spoken previously about initially auditioning for Princess Zelda without knowing the true identity of the role — but what were you told? What direction were you given?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Patricia Summersett:</strong> The best way to describe it was as a bleached script, which is when you have a certain amount of information about what the archetypes of the character are, the general world — for example, that it looks like an RPG fantasy — but you have no idea what the actual roles are going to be or what the game is. And there would've been no way of predicting that it was Zelda because she didn't have a voice before. I just would never have assumed that was the game that I was auditioning for. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was the description of her being a younger teenage princess, but wise beyond her years, having the weight of the world on her. And those were key things I'd gone into when I looked at the script, when I started to play around with my voice and decide what to do for that particular character. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I also auditioned for Zelda as well as some other roles — what ended up being Urbosa and I think probably the Deku Tree. There were a few. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Your portrayal of Zelda has a British accent, was that also a note from Nintendo?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> No, no, it was a really wide open spec. I schooled in London and so I thought something that sounds a little bit RP would make it heightened and put it into that kind of class system I was imagining for royalty. So I did that. I think in the game it's easier now, especially because it's evolved a bit over time and people's interpretations of the character and even the accent has evolved over time. It's a little more comfortable to say this is a Hylian accent versus just a particular version of a UK accent. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/gettyimages-695417050-1772122398636.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Patricia Summersett. Image credit: Randy Shropshire/Getty Images for Alienware.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Clearly it struck a chord with Nintendo — and now a British actress has been cast as Zelda for the franchise's live-action movie, too.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> That's a great point. I mean, I don't know how those casting decisions ultimately get made, and it's like, what does portray that character the best? Obviously Bo Bragason is going to kill it, she's going to be amazing. I'm happy to have contributed in any way, without knowing where it's all headed, other than the fact that it's now been 10 years. I'm just floored by the fact I've been involved in this franchise for a quarter of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You've played the same incarnation of Zelda now in four games, which may be a record for the franchise. But do you feel like there's still more story in her to tell?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> I was surprised when Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment came to be! I only learn about these things when something is offered back to me and I'm told 'okay, it's time to come back and do this role.' And I go, 'oh my gosh, I get to do it again, that's amazing.' I'm not part of that decision making, and I just wait to see what Nintendo is cooking up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>As a fan of the franchise, but also someone who has portrayed Zelda, what are your hopes for the live-action movie?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> I guess I'm just curious to see what that iteration is. Obviously it is going to be a large collaboration between people who are new to the series and those deeply schooled in the series. [I think]  you're going to see a strong Zelda. I'm sure you're going to see a powerful lead character in Zelda. And Link I have no idea, is he going to speak? They certainly haven't alluded to the fact that he does, yet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Speaking of Link and Zelda, you've previously discussed the relationship between the two characters and your own thoughts on what kind of relationship they have. You've also said yourself </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tears-of-the-kingdom-hints-that-link-and-zelda-are-finally-in-a-relationship"><strong>that your comments there got misconstrued</strong></a><strong> — I'd love to give you the space to lay out your thoughts on their relationship in full.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> I have to be so careful when I answer that question. Let me formulate this... I have all sorts of personal theories about what this might be, but I think there's something beautiful in the way that it's left ambiguous, it's left in a kind of — if there are romantic undertones, it's left in an unrequited state. There's obviously a deep friendship and a protectorship between the two of them. It's a gorgeous relationship and it continues to evolve and be left open in so many iterations of this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what that means for me, as somebody who represents the character at things like conventions, is that anybody can come up to me with their version of what they think Link and Zelda are. And a lot of it comes in the form of coupleship — people proposing to each other and getting engaged with Zelda as a theme, or they feel like it's something that they want to just celebrate with family or friends. It can mean kind of anything, and I love that it lives in that space. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Of course, Link and Zelda do appear to be cohabiting in Tears of the Kingdom, in a house with only one bed. Your thoughts on that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> [Laughs] Hopefully it's a very comfortable bed. That's my thought on that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And when you mentioned that it's left in an unrequited state, do you mean that there is something romantic there from one of the pair, but unreturned?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> I have to be careful with that word unrequited. That might be one interpretation of what their particular kind of relationship is — and relationship meaning that they could be friends, they could be warrior buddies, they could be a princess and a soldier, they could be a lovership, or people who are destined to be together even in a non-romantic way, but for their life they're going to have this lifelong friendship. It could be anything. And even for those who do put an obvious romantic tinge onto it, it would still be really on the nose to suddenly have Link and Zelda, because they have this deep relationship, having to get together in a romantic sense. Because that's not the way life works. I think that I prefer that it's not so on the nose as that, personally.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You've said previously that your comments on the subject were misconstrued, and I wondered at the time whether your clarification there came from a place of Nintendo itself saying, essentially, we need this to be a thing that remains ambiguous. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> No, nobody's ever said anything to me. I just needed to clarify what had happened with a particular article, where they'd isolated a sentence that I'd said, and highlighted it as 'Patricia has confirmed that Link and Zelda are in a relationship.' It's really tricky when you're trying to do these kinds of interviews and people take something completely out of context for the sake of clickbait. I was being used for clickbait and I'm like, 'this is precisely not what I said.' If you read the article further, I said that I liked that it's left open, that it's ambiguous. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Relationships come in all forms, and the fact that it was taken out of context and it was as if I was confirming that they were in a romantic relationship, I found that pretty angering to be honest. And I tried to deal with it as best I could, but it's hard when things blow up online. That's been an interesting thing to navigate in the last few years, just being a simple voice actor trying to stay in my lane and be open to anybody who might come to me to celebrate the series, representing a character but not representing the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You've represented Zelda in a few games now, but I'm keen to hear your favorites from the series. You can still say ones you're in though!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> I am partial to Breath of the Wild, but Ocarina of Time is really the ground zero of what the series means for me. And then maybe I'd say the original, though I was a child watching other people play that. And then I really liked Twilight Princess as well, just the art style of that one. So those are probably the top three.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Twilight Princess still has something of a mixed reception among fans, I feel like.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> I see a lot of cosplay from Twilight Princess at conventions, and I also write in Twilight Princess Hylian, so I feel a little more connected to that game when I'm writing that in notes to people. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sorry, you write in Twilight Princess Hylian?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett: </strong>It's something I did early on when I was recording [Breath of the Wild] and I was just starting to look through [series companion book] Hyrule Historia at the different versions of the languages from all the previous games. Obviously, Breath of the Wild wasn't out yet, so I didn't know what would be in that game. But I saw Twilight Princess Hylian and it's so beautiful. I thought I could probably learn those characters, which is essentially just the alphabet, and started practicing that over coffee. So now I can kind of write fluently and use it all the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And lastly, we've seen plenty of Zelda remakes already over the years, but do you have a particular game from the past you'd like to see return in a new form?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett: </strong>I'm trying to think through what I've played recently. A few years ago, I played the original Zelda again on the mini NES console... </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How about Ocarina of Time in the Breath of the Wild engine, with a fully-voiced Princess Zelda again?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> Oh! Can I say I would like that too? It's a great idea. Yeah. You'd have two of the most innovative games coming together with a wild sense of humor and a wonderful soundtrack. So what's not to love about that? </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Randy Shropshire/Getty Images for Alienware</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
