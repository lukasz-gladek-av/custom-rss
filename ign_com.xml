            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft's housing feature launched this week for everyone who purchased the upcoming Midnight expansion early. Though the feature is still in its early stages, players (including yours truly) are already losing hours upon hours creating elaborate homes with the decor available. But Horde players in particular are really struggling to contend with one major issue: their house exteriors are ugly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, that's a little mean. If you play an orc, or are into the orc aesthetics of spikes, flames, haphazard metal plates, and slapdash wooden boards nailed on, the Horde exteriors are fine. The issue is that a lot of the Horde - namely, everyone who doesn't play an orc - generally prefers a less...grungey aesthetic. Alliance players also only get one exterior housing option, but their homes are fairly standard, inoffensive cottages that most people will find tolerable at worst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately for anyone unhappy with what's on offer, until Midnight fully launches, this is it. You can customize your exterior in various ways by changing up roof colors and chimney styles, but it's all in your faction's default aesthetic. Blizzard has <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/blizzard-is-launching-their-own-dps-meters-and-improving-nameplates-in-midnight-378291" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promised that Night Elf and Blood Elf exteriors will arrive on Midnight's release</a>, with more options planned for later on. But for now you're stuck with either a cottage or a spike shack one way or another. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some players, like myself, are just trying to make the best of it with outdoor decorations. Here's my modest hut. You'd never know that inside is a cozy Shaman retreat, complete with a small magical library, a snug kitchen, and a stone altar dedicated in honor of the elements.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/wowscrnshot-120425-150753-1764885571991.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Home sweet orc shack.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But a lot of players are getting far, far more creative in their attempts to subvert the shabby exterior design. You see, Blizzard's decoration tools are very, very precise if you want them to be, and can ignore collision if you want them to. Which has led to Horde players trying to mask the orc-ness of their huts by covering them with...well, all sorts of other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, this person turned their house into a nice cave:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This person took a crack at a more Blood Elf-looking style:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This person made something simple yet effective:</p><div><blockquote data-embed-height="660" data-embed-theme="light">Posts from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1pdmsmr/i_reject_the_horde_mudhuts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wow</a><br> community on Reddit</blockquote></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this one is pretty cool:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, in doing this, one issue players are running up against is that there <em>is </em>a limit to how much decor you can put outside, and many of the objects people are using to cover up the orc turrets use up a significant portion of that limit. As a result, if you want to cover your house in rocks, you can't do much else with your yard. It seems like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1pe6ddu/blizz_please_increase_the_outdooor_decor_cap_ive/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everyone is begging Blizzard</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1pe0qfn/exterior_decor_limit_takes_away_a_lot_of_fun_out/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raise the exterior decor cap</a>, an issue they <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-asked-world-of-warcrafts-housing-team-about-couples-housing-more-neighborhoods-hidden-secrets-decorating-contests-and-more">told us they're well aware of and working on</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Realistically, this is not a massive issue at the moment: we knew going in that this was effectively an early access feature and some functionality would be limited. More than anything, it's funny to see the lengths players will go to in order to get creative with the tools they have available to them. Just imagine what they'll be capable of once they don't have to waste all their outdoor decor space on big wooden platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft: Midnight <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-expansion-release-date-confirmed">launches on March 2, 2026</a>. If you want to get your hands on housing before then, you've got to pre-order the expansion - any version of it will do. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-asked-world-of-warcrafts-housing-team-about-couples-housing-more-neighborhoods-hidden-secrets-decorating-contests-and-more">recently spoke with</a> Jesse Kurlancheek, housing lead and principal game designer, and Joanna Giannullis, senior UX designer, about the housing feature, including how its gone in the beta so far, and what to expect in Midnight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4</a> has confirmed the addition of something no video game has ever had before: a playable Primarch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Warhammer 40,000 lore, the Primarchs are genetically engineered, demigod-like warriors created by the Emperor of Mankind to lead the Space Marine Legions. They are immensely superior to other humans, possessing superhuman strength, speed, and intelligence, and each is designed to embody a specific trait or aspect of war, such as a master strategist or a stealth expert.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Primarchs have appeared in Warhammer 40,000 video games before (Roboute Guilliman, primarch of the Ultramarines, and Mortarion, Daemon Primarch of the Death Guard Chaos Space Marines, have popped up), none has ever been playable in all the years Warhammer 40,000 video games have been around — until now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dawn of War 4 developer King Art Games has confirmed Dark Angels Primarch Lion El'Jonson is playable at one point towards the end of the story campaign, co-written by Black Library author John French (Dropsite Massacre, Cypher: Lord of the Fallen). This also confirms the Dark Angels as a second playable chapter of Space Marines in the game alongside Dawn of War veterans the Blood Ravens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new story trailer shows the Dark Angels turn up to help the Blood Ravens in the fight against the Orks and Nercons on the war-torn world of Kronus. We get a glimpse of The Lion, with his helmet on, at the end of the trailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>The trailer opens with a look at how the Blood Ravens under Captain Cyrus and Chief Librarian Jonah Orion have arrived in orbit over Kronus at the start of the game. After an intense orbital fight with the Warboss Gorgutz and his Orks, both factions find themselves planetside where Guzcutta — the second Ork Commander — is already waiting.</blockquote><blockquote>Elsewhere on Kronus, Technoarcheologist Potentia Delta-9 surveys the planet for its lost knowledge as the Chronomancer Thothmek begins the Necron’s invasion, awakening Kronus’ dormant tombs in their own search for secrets.</blockquote><blockquote>The Imperium’s forces are beset on all sides, their last stand losing strength and the lines on the verge of collapse… until, at the crucial moment, it becomes clear they are not alone: the Dark Angels arrive.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 Dark Angels Trailer Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dark Angels are one of two factions of Space Marines in Dawn of War 4 and are a fully playable faction in all game modes. Here are the key points:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">● During the Space Marines campaign, players will undertake missions in command of both the Blood Ravens and the Dark Angels, and they can pick which missions they want to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">● The Dark Angels have their own, playable Commanders for the Space Marines campaign: Company Master Astoran and Chaplain Ezrael.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">● The Dark Angels have their own unique identity and history. As Space Marines, they share core strategies, tactics, wargear, and weaponry, while still maintaining the distinctive flavor and abilities of their Chapter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">● While the Blood Ravens are often engaged in smaller conflicts that require tactical finesse and sometimes involve stealth, the Dark Angels deploy their full might to the biggest battlefields. Precision strikes vs. all-out war.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">● As the story saga reaches its breaking point, Lion El’Jonson himself descends onto the battlefield, giving players, for the first time ever, the chance to wield the legendary might of a Space Marine Primarch in a climactic, unforgettable finale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of today’s announcement, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-didnt-really-care-about-balance-how-the-developers-of-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4-made-primarch-lion-eljonson-playable-in-game">IGN interviewed Dawn of War 4 director Jan Theysen to find out everything you need to know about Lion El'Jonson’s arrival</a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/hello-sunshine-is-survival-worth-sweating-for</link>
            <guid>1373809</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bask in the sun… and risk getting the meanest sunburn of your life. Hello Sunshine is an impressive step up from the usual post-apocalypse survival RPG formula, playing with some clever ideas around scorching sunlight, blissful shade, and the cycle of day and night.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I previewed a hands-off, pre-alpha slice of Hello Sunshine’s story-driven, single-player campaign with the developers at Red Thread Games, many of whom are veteran developers in the narrative gaming world (think Dreamfall, The Longest Journey, and The Secret World). </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hello Sunshine is looking extremely polished for something built by just seven people, and puts a cool twist on what “suspense” means in the genre. From the extreme, sizzling heat of day to uncovering lore during frigid nights – here is why I believe Hello Sunshine’s future is looking bright.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Coming in hot</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The team didn’t mention any sort of inspiration from the Fallout series, but right from the start screen there’s no denying the visual parallels – a skeleton in a folding camping chair, still clutching a drink as if the world ended mid-sip. Pressing the start button, the player character stumbles past, immediately launching you into this weird wasteland world. It wasn’t clear to me whether she was a preset character or customizable, but (in this preview, at least) she appeared to be the silent type.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The team didn’t mention any sort of inspiration from the Fallout series, but right from the start screen there’s no denying the visual parallels.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In this cruel and scorching desert, it’s clear that she is already suffering from the early symptoms of heatstroke, and she’s also very sad about finding a water bottle that turns out to be empty. This scene is the introduction to Hello Sunshine’s heat and thirst mechanics – a delicate balancing act of avoiding collapse from dehydration or slow-cooking in the harsh sunlight. Robots aside, the sun is essentially your biggest enemy (but with ray tracing).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ruined buildings yield water and other supplies that help you maintain a survivable body temperature, but shadows also play a huge role. If you’re roasting, resting in shade can keep your temperature down. And almost immediately, you’ll meet the most interesting shadow dynamic of all – Hello Sunshine’s other “main character,” who is a skyscraper-sized robot that seems to have a clearer idea of where it’s going than you do.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Chasing shadows</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This metallic gentle giant is, like you, wandering through these badlands. It kind of ignores you in the beginning, but you’ll be grateful for the enormous shadow it casts as it moves, shielding you from UV-based harm as you follow it along sand dunes and amongst rusted shipping containers. And no, it won’t wait patiently for you if you saunter off; you’ll need to keep up with its pace if you don’t want to end up dying humiliatingly of sunburn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is survival through solar instinct and (coining an ahem hot new term here) shade management, not health bars alone – creating an urgency that adds an unconventional form of suspense to your strange journey.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hello Sunshine Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The landscape, of course, hides precious resources – but you’ll need to strategize and carefully time your brief detours from the robot’s shadow. Spend too much time dilly-dallying and the robot may move too far ahead, meaning you won’t make it back before your heat meter runs out. The sun’s path, from afternoon to sunset, was particularly brilliant – with shadows lengthening or shrinking as the day progresses, you’ll need to adapt your decisions about how far you wander.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can expect that you’ll find more awesome loot the farther you stray, of course. No word yet on whether loot will be randomized each playthrough, but I’m hoping that will be the case. Whatever ingredients you’re able to grab could limit what you’re able to craft – and add further challenge, based on what gear you’re able to make and how that may limit your desired playstyle.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bringin’ on the heat</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not all sunbeams, however; Hello Sunshine does include combat, which you can shape according to your desired playstyle. Being noisy and aggressively guns-out (or, more accurately, bows-out), for instance, will probably attract even more enemies – and more scavengeable loot from their remains.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/hello-sunshine-robot-sunhi-2-1764881256232.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Or you can go for more defensive options, potentially even avoiding head-on conflict. I didn’t really get a sense of what a stealthier playthrough might look like, but I’m hoping the confrontational-to-avoidant spectrum is wide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your enemies, by the way, are more robots – definitely angrier than your giant friend – and they curiously seem to have taken on forms of the fleshy species that I assume were otherwise wiped out during the apocalypse. A little metal jackal will snap at your heels, for example, or a hulking robot crab may try to skewer you with its giant claw.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your character’s bow is one of the primary weapons. At first, it doesn’t look like much – kind of pitiful against giant armored bots, really – but you’ll be able to upgrade it throughout the game and craft better ammo for it, such as explosive arrows.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/hello-sunshine-footsteps-1764881256232.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Little events occur here and there to keep your journey interesting – like a distant airdrop of unspecified items, or a sandstorm that gives you brief respite from the sun but also reduces visibility, making it easier for you to lose your robot friend. Many of these events are procedural, hopefully unlocking varied experiences with subsequent playthroughs.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Befriending the sleeping giant</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Conveniently, your enormous robot companion has a circadian rhythm: once the sun sets, it will take a break to recharge. In the preview, this happened at the remains of a Sunshine service station – owned by the ominous corporation whose shareholders, presumably, voted to min-max the humanity-destruction budget.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The service station is basically your inexplicably cheerful crafting workshop, complete with happy tinkling music. You can take a breather here, check out your loot from the day, “recycle” unwanted items, and use the parts to 3D-print new gear – from health packs to flashlights or even new shoes. You can also mend the wear-and-tear wrought on your gear throughout the day. Did you rip up your pants sliding down dunes butt-first? Repair ‘em here.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/hello-sunshine-nomad-robot-meet-1764881256232.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sunshine building also acts as a robot maintenance site, allowing you to make repairs or upgrade the big guy. As I mentioned previously, it pretty much ignores you in the early stages – but if you impress it enough with your ongoing care, it may begin to care about you too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You won’t want to stray far at night, though, as it gets chilly. The preview didn’t demonstrate any “night runs,” but that’s apparently something you’ll be able to do, which could be a nice (or fraught) accompaniment to the day journeys – no word on how optional these runs may be, or whether they’ll offer different rewards (or even plot developments).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the story unfolds during these night sequences; start a campfire and strangers just may show up. The preview didn’t show interactions with any of these strangers, but they may or may not be very nice people. Regardless of whether they turn out to be friends or meanies, they will unveil parts of the Sunshine corporation’s mysterious origins.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">In short: shade wins</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/hello-sunshine-sitting-hand-1764881256232.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sunshine rest stop was where our preview ended – though we were told that the player would progress through different biomes over the following in-game days. Since I only saw the desert area, the wildly different weather conditions of various other environments may really transform what to expect in the lead-up to release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though I only saw part of the single-player campaign, there will also be co-op (split-screen and online); buddy up, and you will both experience a reframed version of the story. It’s recommended you do this after the main campaign so you can get the full story behind whatever the heck is going on in this world. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The wildly different weather conditions of various other environments may really transform what to expect in the lead-up to release.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hello Sunshine is the studio’s first foray into both the RPG and survival genres, so will their narrative pedigree see it through? I like their chances based on what I’ve seen so far. Everyone loves a good “evil corporation” story, and I honestly still can’t get over how cool those dawn-to-dusk shadow mechanics are (I can imagine other game designers thinking, “Damn, why didn’t I think of that?!”). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If your overall question about Hello Sunshine is “Does it look good?” then yes, it is very promising. And if it’s “Will I melt to death holding a handmade bow?” the answer is still yes – but enthusiastically.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/hello-sunshine-is-survival-worth-sweating-for]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, 1047 Games revealed that Splitgate 2 is relaunching as Splitgate: Arena Reloaded on December 17, 2025. It will be available as a free-to-play game across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes following the launch and "unlaunch" of Splitgate 2 earlier this year. Splitgate 2 released in June to middling reviews, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">controversy</a>, and a rapid drop-off of players as criticism of the game grew. In response, 1047 "unlaunched" Splitgate 2, announcing in July it would temporarily wind down support for it while the team worked on a new version of the game with "big, sweeping changes."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-will-go-back-to-beta-to-undergo-a-massive-rework-amid-more-layoffs-and-splitgate-1-shutdown">spoke to CEO Ian Proulx at the time</a>. During our conversation, he explained that Splitgate 2 as it was at launch was "not a finished product yet," and that fans were clamoring for a game that was closer to Splitgate 1. At the time, he assured the team would be focused on updating the game in accordance with player feedback, including adding "basic features" like a leaderboard and better progression, more portal walls, and adjustments to game modes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Proulx also said he wanted to make the season pass and monetization in general less confusing while keeping the game free-to-play. At the time, Proulx projected the update would take place in early 2026, so this December release is sooner than expected.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Splitgate: Arena Reloaded Relaunch Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what, then, is Splitgate: Arena Reloaded? According to a press release, it "reimagines everything from core combat to UI." Here's an overview provided by 1047 of the major updates:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>Removed Factions, Abilities, and select equipment to refocus on classic arena combat</em></li><li><em>Rebuilt progression from the ground up and overhauled the Ranked system</em></li><li><em>Introduced 5 new, and 6 fully-reworked maps, 3 new Primary Weapons and 1 new Power Weapon: the Railgun</em></li><li><em>New Arena modes, playlist selection, and a true Classic Arena mode with even starts and powerups</em></li><li><em>Reduced store prices, simplified the Battle Pass, and improved overall cosmetic quality</em></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">An accompanying video featuring former Rocket League game director and current 1047 design director Josh Watson also notes that Arena Reloaded includes the addition of player stats, leaderboards, and a career system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We initially <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-review">gave Splitgate 2 at launch a 7/10</a>, calling it "a decent successor to the original that expands on it, but never really surpasses it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It’s a hugely exciting prospect for fans of the setting, who have so far had to imagine what it would be like to play as a Primarch in a video game. Now, we’ll get to control The Lion himself, the reborn leader of the Dark Angels chapter of Space Marines, as he presumably swats away all before him with the Emperor’s Shield and Fealty. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how did developer King Art Games convince Games Workshop to let them do what no other developer has done before? And how did it approach making the seriously overpowered Lion El'Jonson work in Dawn of War 4? What does his inclusion mean for Dawn of War 4’s potential canon status within the setting? And will we get to see his face?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I sat down with director Jan Theysen to ask these questions and many more. We get into some serious detail about The Lion, the Dark Angels, and where we’re at in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, so sit down, relax, and trust in the Emperor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I think the first obvious question is why did you choose the Dark Angels as the second playable faction for the Space Marines?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> When we talked about, okay, what are the factions we want in the game, it's obvious that you need the Blood Ravens, right? It's a Dawn of War. And we talked about the other factions and then at some point it came up, okay, why just have the Blood Ravens? Maybe there is an option to also have another faction or another chapter. And basically Games Workshop said, ‘Hey, why not Dark Angels, could be a cool pick?’ And we said, ‘Oh, okay, of course, why not? Cool pick.’ And then they said, ‘Okay, what about… do you want Lion El'Jonson?’ And we were like, ‘Oh, okay, cool idea.’ That's basically it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So Games Workshop suggested Dark Angels to you guys? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> Yeah, basically they said, ‘Hey, just because it's a Dawn of War doesn't mean that it can be only Blood Ravens, right? There could be other Space Marines in there as well. And this was basically, okay then let's talk about it. What are the options and what could be a cool addition? And we took it from there.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: There'll be a system where you'll be able to choose between playing as the Blood Ravens and the Dark Angels and you pick the missions you want to play. How will that work?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> As you might know, we have four different campaigns in the game and for all of the campaigns we try to figure out something that gives the players some choices or some things they can do and influence in the campaign. And so for example, in the Ork campaign, you can literally pick, okay, do you want to play these Orks or these Orks and they're fighting each other. And so that's a very clear distinction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the Space Marines, of course that doesn’t make sense, right? They're not really different goals or anything, they're not fighting each other, but they're working on the same thing. And so we basically said, okay, what we can do is we can offer different gameplay experiences based on the factions, because story-wise, the Dark Angels, they have all the toys and all the power and they can basically do the big battles and the epic conflicts, while the Blood Ravens are… they have bigger problems and they need to rely on smaller operations, behind enemy lines, a little bit more covert operations maybe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so basically how this works is we have this Space Marine campaign story and there are different things happening at the same time. The Blood Ravens and the Dark Angels, sometimes they are at the same place at the same time and then you can play both of them. But other times it's like, okay, Dark Angels do this now, Blood Ravens do this now, who do we want to play? And then you can basically pick, hey, I want the big all out war battle or I want to play this more tactical thing maybe with the Blood Ravens. And then you can pick and then at some point they meet again, or the things converge again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So you don’t change the story outcome?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> The story remains the same, but the question is which parts of the story you encounter or you play with because the other stuff still happens, but then you only hear from it if you're not a part of it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Do the Dark Angels have different units at their disposal? Are the gameplay mechanics different? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> In general it's all Space Marines, right? The faction is Space Marines, but storywise in the campaign, the Blood Ravens don't have access to all the toys and to the big armies and so on. So their missions will be more infantry heavy and also a little bit smaller. And there is even here and there something that is more in the stealth or something that leads you to play a little bit more careful maybe, while the Dark Angles is more like okay, the big battles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But they have the same units in multiplayer. In multiplayer for example, if you play the Blood Ravens, you have all the same toys because that's a separate thing. Where they differ is with the heroes. So both of the factions have two playable heroes, except for Lion El'Jonson, who is in the campaign but not really like a playable hero. So they both have two. And that of course leads to different things you can do, but also a little bit different playstyles maybe. So depending on the hero you pick, if you really are into slow progress and powerful defensive units, then you might pick the Terminator captain. And if you are more about quick stealthy stuff, you might pick Cyrus. There they can differ a little bit in terms of gameplay. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/warhammer-40-000-dawn-of-war-iv-story-trailer-chief-librarian-jonah-orion-1764858391841.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Chief Librarian Jonah Orion.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Let's talk about The Lion. We've never had a playable Primarch in a Warhammer 40,000 video game before. Why are you allowed to do this when no other developer has been allowed to do this? How did this come about?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> When we talked about the Darker Angels we talked about options, what can we do? And this came up, and it was like, we were just basically asking is that an option or not? Just because let's make sure that we talked about everything. And they said, well yeah, maybe? Tell us what you would like to do with him and then we can tell you if this is an option or not. He's just so off the curve in terms of power level that of course you can't really have him as a normal unit in the game or something you can use in multiplayer or something like that. And so we basically said, okay, we don't want to make this all about The Lion and the whole campaign revolves around him or something, because he is again, so off the curve for that, it wouldn't really… I mean, how can we represent him in a correct way that doesn't mess up your whole game and balancing and everything? And so we basically said, okay, it would be really fun, it would be really cool to have him in the game, and it's a big honor to have him here, but let's just have it as a guest appearance. And so in the game there are two cutscenes and one mission where the Lion plays a role, and you can play him and he is fun and he is off the charts, but he is not available for the rest of the game because he’s just too powerful. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So you came up with a way this would work and convinced Games Workshop?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> I mean I don't think we really had to convince them in terms of, they didn't want to do it or something. It was more like, okay, it obviously would be a cool thing for players to have it in the game, but let's make sure we get it right. And so if we have the Lion in the game, okay, how would he play? What happens? Is he one-shotting everything and how is this interesting? And so we came up with this idea that — without spoiling anything — it's basically the Dark Angels and the Blood Ravens did everything they could to stop the bad thing from happening, and then at the very end there is just something they can't overcome. And that is a big entrance for the Lion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The power sets of the Primarchs are one of the most debated aspects of 40K lore. Fans love pitting the Primarchs against each other and speculating about who would win in a fight. Part of what you're doing here is unmasking a Primarch in a way, and revealing how that might work in a way that we've never seen before. We’re finally getting to see their power set in action.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> In an RTS you try to give all the units that are in the game a certain character that fits the description and that works in terms of lore. But on the other hand, it's also of course an RTS game and you have to make sure that it's balanced, and that the players can understand actually, for example, what is this unit good against? And that is of course a problem if all the units are good against everything. We dealt with that for the whole production to basically figure out how can we make sure that all the factions feel authentic and the units feel authentic and so on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For The Lion, it's a little bit of a special case because it's like the last mission in the game and it's more about, okay, let's have a cool cinematic thing going on here and then it's about having fun with a Primarch, and we didn't really care about if this is balanced or this is something that you can actually could theoretically do in multiplayer, something like that. Who cares, right? This is just to have fun. And if we would ever put Lion El'Jonson in any other mode, he could definitely not be the same unit that he is in the campaign.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/warhammer-40-000-dawn-of-war-iv-story-trailer-ezrael-1764858408388.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Dark Angels have their own playable Commanders for the Space Marines, including Chaplain Ezrael.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Did you think about keeping this under wraps so players could discover it for themselves at the end of the campaign? You are going out now before the game comes out and you're actually talking about it. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> I mean that's always the question, right? Do you want the big surprise for the game or, to be honest, want to use it in marketing? And I think that the point is that in today's landscape it's basically impossible to keep it under wraps. Maybe for a handful of players it would've been mind blowing and really cool and I get that. And of course if you could make sure that this is the case for a lot of players, then we probably would've done it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in reality it probably takes a couple of minutes and you have screenshots of that or a video on TikTok and then that was it. And so for us it was basically, okay, if we talk about the Dark Angels — because that is another thing. Theoretically, we could also maybe have tried to just keep the whole Dark Angels thing under wraps, but again, it's very hard to keep it secret. And then within minutes someone gets a post out and that was it. And so we basically said, okay, it's probably not worth it and let's make sure we all have fun with it early on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: And you sort of spoiled it yourselves. Did you see fans spotted a The Lion file name in a video? Was that intentional?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> It was not. We didn't check the file name.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I would love to talk to you about canon. So have you spoken with GW about if Dawn of War is canon? If The Lion is in the game, I'm assuming it's set after The Lion’s return because what we're seeing here, the model that I've seen in the trailer is the new model. So what have your discussions been like there? Space Marine 2 is canon, and Titus is obviously a massive part of the ongoing narrative. So how do you fit in?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> Actually, I don’t know if there's an official decision for that, and that’s probably something that Games Workshop has to decide in the end. But we know where it takes place in terms of location and time. It would fit into everything else. But I'm not sure if Games Workshop says, okay, this is canon now or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, picking Kronus as the planet the game takes place on. It was more like, okay, we need a planet. Do we invent something new? And basically the question was, well, we could also go back to Kronus and it might be fun to tell a little bit about what happened to the planet and who won the Dark Crusade and all of that. And so why not? And then basically we figured out, okay, where is Kronus? Which side of the Great Rift is it on? And so on. And so you slowly develop how could all of this fit together? But again, if it's now official canon or not, I think that is a question for Games Workshop.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/warhammer-40-000-dawn-of-war-iv-story-trailer-terminators-1764858453541.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dark Angels Terminators deep strike into Dawn of War 4.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So is Kronus in the Imperium Nihilus then? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> Yeah, it's on the other side of the Rift.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Which would explain why the Dark Angels and Lion El'Jonson are able to be there at this point in time.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> Well, it also explains maybe a little bit why the Blood Ravens are struggling, right? Because it's basically that chapter is kind of all over the place, but the guys we are dealing with, they found themselves in Nihilus as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Following that then, are we setting up some sort of relationship between the Dark Angels and the Blood Ravens here that fans will get a kick out of in terms of successor chapters? Or are people reading too much into the idea that they're working together? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> I think that's maybe a little bit too much. I mean obviously we make sure that we represent the chapters and they're both Space Marines, but that doesn't mean that they necessarily trust each other or that they are great friends. But at least for us, it's not a big future thing that now for example, Blood Ravens and Dark Angels are, I dunno… they won't be in a buddy movie anytime soon!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The Blood Ravens are canon, right? They were made part of the canon by Games Workshop. And obviously Dark Angels are. So I think questions like that will be inevitable from fans. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> It's true, but it's also, I mean especially when it comes to the Blood Ravens, it's a relatively small group that basically exists on this planet they use as a recruiting world. It's not like this is now the only thing. There might be other Blood Ravens out there, we don't know. And there are certainly other Dark Angels out there. So it's not like we are writing the history of these chapters now or something.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: If The Lion is in the game, are we talking about the Fallen here in terms of the Dark Angels?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> In general we don't really want story spoilers of course, but I think in this case it's not a part of the story really. There's an immediate threat and it's something that has to be dealt with quickly. And so we are really about that story and not too much about the backstory. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: We’ve seen the Lion wear his helmet. Does he have voice acting? Does he have lines of dialogue? Do we see his face?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> What you see in the trailer is part of the two cutscenes that we have with him, and he definitely starts out without the helmet, just to make sure that everybody understands who it is. And also of course he has lines, a little bit in the cutscenes, but also you can play him. And so obviously being an RTS, he acknowledges if he is supposed to kill someone, for example. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So we'll finally get to hear him speak! You know what modders are going to do when the game comes out, right? They're going to take The Lion and put him in multiplayer or skirmish or whatever it is. You must be predicting that. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> I mean officially I probably have to say that you can't mod anything, but I can see people doing that and also having fun with it, so why not? </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I'd love to get an insight into what it’s like working with Games Workshop when it comes to big lore stuff like this.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jan Theysen:</strong> Without going into the details, we have a group of people on the Games Workshop side working with us, and we use them as this encyclopedia of Warhammer knowledge. So whenever we need something, we kind of need an ability or a weapon that does kind of this, is there something? And then they go away and come back and give us options on what we could use. And that is the main thing, because it's so complex and there is so much stuff. And even if you have someone like John French writing the story, he knows a lot of stuff, but even he maybe doesn't know all the little details for all the different factions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If something is just not correct, then of course they also come back with feedback about that. But for us I think it's fine because in the end what we try to do is to be as authentic as possible. In the past, we all know that there were games that maybe some units and so on didn't feel like maybe they should feel and so on. And we basically said, okay, let's make sure we get this right. And Games Workshop was helping out with that a lot. Let's make sure we get it right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 is scheduled for release in 2026 on PC via Steam.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
