            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-assassins-creed-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-games-in-order">Assassin's Creed series</a> has had us globetrotting through history since its debut in 2007. From Renaissance Italy to Ancient Greece, Ubisoft's open world series has explored a wonderful variety of locations and settings, ensuring each conspiracy-packed game is a (semi) educational window into the past. Such an approach has made the series unique among its genre stablemates, which tend to whisk us away to fantasy lands or sprawling modern-day metropolises. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the bones of Assassin's Creed have mostly remained the same across its 14 mainline entries, the series has undergone a lot of changes over the years, including new takes on player progression and ever-expanding worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But which Assassin's Creed games are the best of the bunch? It's a tough question. After much deliberation (and only a handful of arguments), though, we’ve eventually agreed on the top 10 mainline entries in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, without further ado, here are our top 10 Assassin’s Creed games.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Assassin's Creed Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Playing the latest game in the series? Check out our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/assassins-creed-shadows"><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows guide</em></a><em>. </em></p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Assassin's Creed: Revelations</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2011/06/06/assassins-creed-revelations-20110606095314825-3464823.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-revelations">Assassin’s Creed: Revelations</a> wrapped up Altair Ibn-La-Ahad and Ezio Auditore’s stories, and, despite some unremarkable additions like the Den Defense mode, it was a memorable and thrilling send off. From flying down ziplines in Constantinople to hanging out with Leonardo Da Vinci, Revelations was packed full of fascinating adventures. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ezio and Altair’s final chapter was, in a way, both a sign of things to come and a celebration of what came before. Not only did we get one final fling with these two after seeing them grow and learn from lives full of adventure, but we had a chance to say goodbye to the first era of Assassin’s Creed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Assassin's Creed Syndicate</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/09/24/acssc63previewsasylumzipline1443101428jpg-9b2cc6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin’s Creed games are often as defined by their locations as they are their protagonists, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-syndicate">Assassin's Creed Syndicate</a>’s 19th Century Victorian London in the throes of industrialization may be the most memorable of the bunch. Sneaking around factories, racing horse-drawn carriages down the street, and even fighting Jack the Ripper all ground Syndicate in a setting that, while still fantastical, feels real.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Contributing to this sense of place is the string-heavy score from Journey composer Austin Wintory that doesn’t sound like anything else in the series before or after: dueling protagonists Jacob and Evie Fry even have their own soundtracks. It’s a small touch, but it’s one in a string of small touches that makes Syndicate’s world cohesive. Also, it’s hard to recall any game this side of Bloodborne that lets you fight this effectively with a cane.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Assassin's Creed Valhalla</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/12/01/assassinscreedvalhallafinalcontent-blog-1669914922538.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> didn’t reinvent the wheel like Origins did, but it did make some pretty substantial changes. Combat is weightier and more impactful than ever before; traditional side quests have been replaced by world events, making exploration and discovery much more organic; and the absurd amount of loot you’d have to organize and sift through was toned down substantially, making rewards feel much more valuable on the whole.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eivor might not be our favorite of the Assassin’s Creed protagonists, but her (or his) story is an engaging one, and is one of the best blendings of historical fantasy and mythology that the series has ever seen. Fans of Norse mythology are treated with a feast; not only do the sagas play a major role within the main campaign, but an entire game-length expansion set in the world of Thor and Odin practically turns Valhalla into a cousin of God of War. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/13/ss-c79ca0fa59bedea20c24e2ac0c2735e7ce2f3ae6-1920x1080-1739442669756.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-brotherhood">Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood</a> continues the story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, cementing him as a fan-favorite protagonist for the series. It trades the diverse locations of Assassin’s Creed 2 for an expanded version of Rome and its surrounding countryside and builds on the new mechanics introduced in Assassins Creed 2 – swimming, property management, firearms, and recruitable allies. This chapter of Ezio’s story is filled with charm, wit, and drama, and, thanks to its updated combat, we got to be the aggressive combat assassin we all wanted to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also the first game in the series to introduce multiplayer, allowing players to step into the shoes of the Templars to see who among their friends truly was the best assassin or hunter. It may not have advanced the formula as much as its predecessor, but it’s still cherished by many as one of the very best. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Assassin's Creed Origins</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/13/ss-1a0ab42e93e51c48ad9a6bda7f408958e09a43b0-1920x1080-1739443042212.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Origins marked a turning point in the series. It was the game that turned Assassin’s Creed from a stealth-focused action-adventure, into a straight-up open world RPG with a size and scope rivaled only by very few games. But even setting the historical significance of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin’s Creed Origins</a> aside, it’s important to note that it’s also just a damn good Assassin’s Creed game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its central story involving Bayek and Aya, who initially set out to find justice for their murdered son and ultimately wind up founding the order that would eventually become the Assassin’s Brotherhood, is extremely compelling; the world of ancient Egypt is a marvel to explore; and while many facets of its mechanics were improved in later games, the shift to loot-based progression and a more action <a href="https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-rpgs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPG</a> style of combat was just the kind of shot in the arm that the series needed to reinvigorate it in the eyes of fans.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Assassin's Creed Unity</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/06/09/acuscreencombatsworde31406094pmpst1402143761jpg-b685a9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After the tipsy sway of Black Flag’s pirate protagonist Edward Kenway, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin’s Creed Unity</a> was a return to the tone of original Assassin’s Creed. As the first AC game to be exclusively released on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 (alongside PC of course), Assassin’s Creed Unity was a graphical powerhouse for its time, boasting enormous crowds of NPCs walking through the streets of a near 1:1 accurate recreation of Paris. Even today, it’s still remarkably handsome to look at.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, Unity’s launch was a bit of a bumpy ride. A cavalcade of bugs, glitches, and an intensely overburdened map meant it was quickly written off by many. However, in the years since it has (thanks to several patches) blossomed into a firm favourite among Assassin’s Creed fans. Its enhanced movement system resulted in arguably the most fluid and elegant parkour the series has ever seen, which in turn allowed for excellent hit-and-run tactics. Its main assassination missions are also a series highpoint, offering a multitude of ways to infiltrate locations and bury your blade deep in a target’s neck. And frankly, seeing Notre Dame in all its glory makes AC Unity well worth the price of admission.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Assassin's Creed Shadows</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/19/acs-1742375176700.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Feudal Japan is the most-requested setting for an Assassin’s Creed game of all time, and so Ubisoft faced towering expectations when it finally decided to visit the Sengoku period. Thankfully, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> was exactly what the series needed; it brings the focus back to assassinations, putting increased emphasis on stealth and infiltration. And while still expansive, the open world and RPG elements are more restrained than those in Odyssey and Valhalla, resulting in a tighter, more balanced experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the first time since Syndicate, Shadows features two playable protagonists. Naoe’s toolkit is rooted in stealth, while Yasuke is a brutal fighter who captures the period’s samurai fantasy. While Shadows is best experienced from a mix of both perspectives, taking control of Naoe and making use of her grappling hook and climbing abilities allows you the full freedom to explore what is undoubtedly the series’ most astonishing world, complete with landscapes that dynamically change with the shifting of the seasons. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Assassin's Creed Odyssey</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/13/ss-16fc551879ac299dca68839da90f89d9e624db48-1920x1080-1739442948351.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassins’ Creed Odyssey</a> takes Origins’ combat style and new-found focus on role-playing, adds some extra ingredients to the mix, then sets it all against the sprawling backdrop of Ancient Greece, aflame with the war between Athens and Sparta. It’s an enormous, vibrant game, with some of the most stunning vistas we’ve seen in the series; both at land and sea (naval warfare returns here, and it’s wonderful). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new spin on Assassin’s Creed’s notoriety system sees you hunted across these environments, in a series of cat-and-mouse chases that are the most tense in any Assassin’s Creed to date, while the nation struggle system sees you fighting large scale battles in the name of Athens or Sparta. It’s also got a relatively compelling story for a game that can take 60-odd hours to beat, with some eccentric sidequests, fronted by a genuinely charismatic protagonist - whether you play as a male or female. Even after you finish Odyssey, there’s still so much to plunder and discover, and it’s a delight to simply exist in its world.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Assassin's Creed 2</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/13/ss-d3967a58038cc5e59332bb0043ab1ca343112bc6-1920x1080-1739442866992.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In many ways, we have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-ii">Assassin’s Creed 2</a> to thank for not only proving the formula works but for also giving us the defining analogy of a video game sequel fulfilling the promise of its underwhelming original. Though later entries would add even more depth, ACII made assassination missions more dynamic, with increased flexibility in how you approached objectives, more options for hiding or causing distractions, better combat, and better mobility with the ability to actually swim. New catacomb missions let players put their parkour skills to the test, the upgradeable homebase villa gave players a reason to keep investing in picking up collectibles and coins, and new weapons and gear from everyone’s favorite video game character, Leonardo da Vinci, kept gameplay fresh. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these changes were also connected to a beautifully realized Italian Renaissance era that introduced an all-time protagonist, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, and meaningful additions to the current-day story that brought the two time periods together in the wildest way possible. I mean, you fistfight the pope only to have an otherworldly deity speak through Ezio to Desmond in the present day. It was an unforgettable ending to an entry that proved how incredible Assassin’s Creed could be. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2013/12/10/ac4bfdlc12500x1400jpg-885d49.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After a long run of assassin protagonists, Black Flag tried something different, introducing us to a main character who was a pirate first, and an assassin second - and the ensuing adventure thrived because of it. It introduced a massively entertaining sandbox playground in the Caribbean, featuring a plethora of islands teeming with treasure and activities to embark upon - and an upgrade system that made the idea of hunting wild animals and harpooning something other than a chore. Instead of relegating the idea of sailing as means to an end, it built upon the framework of Assassin’s Creed 3’s naval combat to make nautical adventures the shining point of Black Flag. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it was hunting hapless merchant ships or bracing against some of the toughest buccaneers ever to sail the seas, attacking other ships cemented itself as something too good to pass up any time one floated by on screen. Aided by its impressive seamless transition from land to sea, it allowed the freedom of choice for players to either sail circles around enemy ships while blasting them to pieces, or ramming head on to leap onto the enemy ship, before unloading a brace of pistols like a whirling dervish. Not only did <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-black-flag">Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag</a> cement itself as one of the greatest in the series, it has easily become one of the greatest pirate games to immerse yourself in as well.</p><div id="every-assassins-creed-game-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Assassin's Creed Game Tier List</h3><h3>Every Assassin's Creed Game Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>You may also like: The </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-games-like-assassins-creed"><em>Best Games Like Assassin's Creed</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there you have it!

Honestly, I was betting on summer at best, but here we are with actual product showing up on Amazon and not behind some sketchy paywalled Discord server. While the internet’s currently losing its mind over Prismatic Evolutions and burning money chasing stock alerts for Rival Destinies, the smart play is scooping up the older sets that just hit Amazon Global. We’re talking Scarlet and Violet era stuff, Sword and Shield throwbacks, and boxes that were basically extinct six months ago.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article"> Amazon International Solves Pokémon TCG Shortage With Massive Restocks</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the kind of flood the TCG community needed. Not just for collectors trying to complete sets, but for anyone who’s tired of battling bots for ETBs like it’s the Hunger Games. There’s a real mix available right now: Booster Bundles, Premium Collections, tins with actual storage value. And yes, even a few deals that make it feel like Amazon’s trying to keep the vibe positive. If you’re chasing big pulls like Greninja SIR or Pikachu ex SIR, or just need to stock up on sleeves and dice, this is the best stock refreshes we’ve seen in a while.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Sony WH-1000XM5 Noise Cancelling Headphones for $225</h2><div catalogid="36a3b9f5-2ced-42c2-8fd0-f4fa3b4e7cdd" id="215541"><p data-cy="paragraph">AliExpress is currently offering the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoXdnv?object_uuid=4bfe7cc4-dd34-49ec-8fe7-cc48f6258d51&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphones</a> for only $225.18 after coupon code: <strong>IFP7FJZ </strong>is applied during checkout.

At $63.34, this one comes with four booster packs and a pre-release promo card, which makes it a solid pickup for collectors looking to flesh out their Sword and Shield era sets.

It supports cross-platform play, customizable settings, and chaotic emergency meetings that usually end with the wrong person getting ejected. If you’ve somehow missed the social deduction chaos, now’s the perfect time to catch up and take three crewmates down with you.</p></div><p id="pokemon-tcg-hisuian-electrode-v-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG: Hisuian Electrode V Box">Pokemon TCG: Hisuian Electrode V Box</h2></p><div catalogid="5af74e62-4a2a-42ce-908f-201f35801727" id="217166"><div id="217166" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG: Hisuian Electrode V Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <em>Hisuian Electrode V Box</em> is back in stock at Amazon for $42.45, which is a win considering how sporadically these pop up. It's one of those V boxes that slipped under the radar when it first launched, but now that Sword and Shield-era product is drying up it’s worth grabbing. You get a foil Hisuian Electrode V promo, a regular Electrode foil, an oversized version (because why not), and four booster packs to rip through.</p></div><p id="ign-x-assassins-creed-shadows-snack"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="IGN x Assassin’s Creed Shadows Snack">IGN x Assassin’s Creed Shadows Snack Box</h2></p><div catalogid="a1764be7-7576-4ba9-b44e-c6dd9cb0f16c" id="217180"><div id="217180" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>IGN x Assassin’s Creed Shadows Snack Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This limited-edition snack box is a flavor-packed tribute to <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, blending premium Japanese treats with collectible game merch in a way that feels like an edible side quest.

If you missed the chaos of launch day or couldn’t snag a bundle without battling bots, this is your chance to catch up.</p></div><p id="samsung-49-inch-odyssey-g9-g95sd"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="SAMSUNG 49-Inch Odyssey G9 (G95SD)">Samsung 49-Inch Odyssey G9 (G95SD)</h2></p><div catalogid="a1764be7-7576-4ba9-b44e-c6dd9cb0f16c" id="217056"><div id="217056" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>SAMSUNG 49-Inch Odyssey G9 (G95SD)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.</p></div><p id="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-cell-phone"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Cell Phone ">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Cell Phone 256GB</h2></p><div catalogid="a1764be7-7576-4ba9-b44e-c6dd9cb0f16c" id="217059"><div id="217059" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Cell Phone 256GB</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.</p></div><p id="samsung-electronics-870-evo-2tb-25"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Samsung Electronics 870 EVO 2TB 2.5 ">Samsung Electronics 870 EVO 2TB 2.5 Inch SATA III Internal SSD</h2></p><div catalogid="a1764be7-7576-4ba9-b44e-c6dd9cb0f16c" id="217060"><div id="217060" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Samsung Electronics 870 EVO 2TB 2.5 Inch SATA III Internal SSD</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I can’t think of a reason <em>not</em> to buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it.

The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.</p></div><p id="samsung-t7-shield-2tb-portable-ssd"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" SAMSUNG T7 Shield 2TB, Portable SSD"> SAMSUNG T7 Shield 2TB, Portable SSD</h2></p><div catalogid="a1764be7-7576-4ba9-b44e-c6dd9cb0f16c" id="217061"><div id="217061" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> SAMSUNG T7 Shield 2TB, Portable SSD</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferring <em>way too many</em> photos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.</p></div><p id="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-ai-cell-phon"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phon">SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB </h2></p><div catalogid="a1764be7-7576-4ba9-b44e-c6dd9cb0f16c" id="217058"><div id="217058" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB </h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.</p></div><p id="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-5g-124-256"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab S10+ 5G 12.4” 256">SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab S10+ 5G 12.4” 256GB</h2></p><div catalogid="a1764be7-7576-4ba9-b44e-c6dd9cb0f16c" id="217057"><div id="217057" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab S10+ 5G 12.4” 256GB</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.</p></div><p id="apple-airpods-pro-2-anc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods Pro 2 ANC">Apple AirPods Pro 2 ANC</h2></p><div catalogid="a1764be7-7576-4ba9-b44e-c6dd9cb0f16c" id="216986"><div id="216986" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro 2 ANC</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Apple’s best earbuds are now $50 off.
