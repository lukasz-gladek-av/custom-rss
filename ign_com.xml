            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ready to feel old? Today marks the 25th(!) anniversary of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-ix"><u>Final Fantasy 9</u></a>, and Square Enix is going all out byâ€¦ uh, launching a fan art project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If that falls a little short of your remake-shaped expectations, you're not alone. There was a lot of excitement about the much-discussed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-ix"><u>Final Fantasy 9 remake</u></a> after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/official-final-fantasy-9-25th-anniversary-website-set-tongues-wagging-on-potential-switch-2-nintendo-direct-remake-reveal"><u>Square Enix launched an official Final Fantasy 9 25th Anniversary website earlier this year</u></a>, and while the publisher has at least acknowledged Final Fantasy 9's special day with an "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFDDlEaUXxw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>anniversary special movie</u></a>" and a request to collect special memories from fans, that's pretty much it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Celebrating 25 years of Final Fantasy 9 today," said a tweet posted to the game's official X/Twitter account yesterday, July 6. "When a theatre troupe set out for a royal kidnapping, Zidane and Princess Garnet are thrown into an emotional adventure that's never left the hearts of those who've played it. What does FFIX mean to you?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, in a follow-up message posted today (July 7), Square Enix <a href="https://support.na.square-enix.com/ceform.php?id=441&amp;la=1&amp;h=cbf426fd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>invited players aged 13 and up in selected countries</u></a> to submit their FF9 fan art between now and the end of October. If selected, it will then be used on the Final Fantasy portal site, as well as official social network accounts.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">â€” FINAL FANTASY (@FinalFantasy) <a href="https://twitter.com/FinalFantasy/status/1942056235010073084?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The X/Twitter account of passion project Final Fantasy 9: Memoria Project further stoked speculation earlier today by quote-tweeting Square's post, adding: "When are we going to tell them, Square Enix?"</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">When are we going to tell them, <a href="https://twitter.com/SquareEnix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@SquareEnix</a>? <a href="https://t.co/yLt8EQuWOD" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/yLt8EQuWOD</a></p>â€” Final Fantasy IX: Memoria Project (@MemoriaProject) <a href="https://twitter.com/MemoriaProject/status/1942104895882141808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's a far cry from what some fans had hoped for, not least because last year, Final Fantasy 14 producer Naoki 'Yoshi-P' Yoshida <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yoshi-p-thinks-a-final-fantasy-9-remake-would-take-more-than-one-game"><u>talked a bit about what a Final Fantasy 9 remake might look like</u></a>, warning it may not all fit in one game and so go in the direction of Final Fantasy 7 Remake. Earlier in 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-9-remake-rumors-fuelled-by-final-fantasy-14-director-yoshi-p"><u>Yoshi-P also announced Final Fantasy 9-themed extras</u></a> for the Collectorâ€™s Edition and Digital Collectorâ€™s Edition of Final Fantasy 14 expansion <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-dawntrail"><u>Dawntrail</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, the game's social media and Reddit communities have been full of shocked players commenting on the lack of news. "This CANNOT be it bro," <a href="https://x.com/ThePrinceMagus/status/1942069129847988416" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a> one. "The remake. Announce the remake," while another <a href="https://x.com/Chelseapaul23/status/1942060055550931434" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>: "At least confirm or deny the remake rumors plz."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The 25th anniversary is a big milestone and announcing it would be the best right now.

How are you doing given the so far disappointment of no announcement?", one fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyIX/comments/1ltnqlv/comment/n1rqoo6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>: "At this point I've played myself more than I've played the actual game.

The list, confirmed legit by Nvidia but potentially outdated, includes a number of Square Enix games the company has either announced or released since, such as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/chrono-cross-the-radical-dreamers-edition"><u>Chrono Cross remaster</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iv"><u>Kingdom Hearts 4</u></a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-long-rumored-remake-is-real-after-all-includes-voice-acting-and-classic-original-version">Final Fantasy Tactics remake</a>, and of course the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake"><u>Final Fantasy 7 remake</u></a> for PC. However, Final Fantasy 9 remake has yet to materialize. Just a few months before the Nvidia leak, in June 2021, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/final-fantasy-ix-the-animated-series"><u>Final Fantasy 9 animated series was reported to be in development</u></a>, although we havenâ€™t heard anything about it in the years since, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Both are versions of the classic PokÃ©mon Donphan â€” and now fans are debating how Paradox PokÃ©mon will debut. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In PokÃ©mon Scarlet and Violet, players can encounter Paradox PokÃ©mon in the wild â€” though in PokÃ©mon Go, there's an expectation that these powerful creatures will likely pop up in raids, similar to how the Ultra Beasts from PokÃ©mon Sun and Moon debuted. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paradox PokÃ©mon originally being spotted in Scarlet/Violet's "Area Zero" crater has meanwhile led some fans to suggest the species would be a good fit for this year's PokÃ©mon Go Wild Area event, which is designed to feel like something of a safari. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">22 Paradox PokÃ©mon species exist, with a selection of more common and Legendary PokÃ©mon remixed. Jigglypuff gets a billion-year-old variant named Scream Tail, for example, while the Legendary Terrakion gets a new variant, Iron Boulder, that looks like an anime robot. Regardless of how some of the Paradox species are introduced, these new versions of Legendary creatures seem most likely to be found in raids.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/07/xxwyyaad4cbf1-1751879193869.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">PokÃ©mon Go's 9th Anniversary artwork.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One note of caution about PokÃ©mon Go's anniversary artwork is that the game has, on occasion, not always followed through with what these images have set up. Fans have been quick to point to past teases for Mega Mewtwo and fan-favorite Ghost critter Mimikyu in previous annual artworks, only to not materialise. But PokÃ©mon Go's developer has seemingly become wiser to these expectations â€” and indeed Paradox PokÃ©mon are the logical choice for the next big selection of creatures to join the game, after the recent debut of Gigantamax creatures, the fully-launched Ultra Beasts and almost all Mega PokÃ©mon now being available. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other teases in this year's artwork include Gigantamax Butterfree, which fans expect to debut soon, Mega Metagross, one of the game's last remaining Mega species yet to turn up, and a player avatar receiving a virtual thumbs up (which some fans are taking as a sign that remote communication or even remote trading might be arriving). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there's Zygarde, star of the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">PokÃ©mon Legends Z-A</a> for Switch and Switch 2. While already in PokÃ©mon Go, fans are currently limited to having just one of the creature. Could we see more become available, and potentially through Mega Raids, if Zygarde does get a Mega in Z-A? As with the temporally-divergent Paradox PokÃ©mon themselves, time will tell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, PokÃ©mon Go's developer said it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-developer-acknowledges-golden-pokstop-issue-ruining-games-big-9th-anniversary-event-now-investigating-fix">investigating an issue with Golden PokÃ©Stops that intefered with in-game 9th anniversary celebrations</a>. Last month, IGN sat down with PokÃ©mon Go director Michael Steranka to discuss the game's future, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-developer-addresses-pay-to-win-fears-as-it-introduces-unprecedented-20-premium-pass-with-gold-bottle-cap-that-boosts-a-pokmons-stats-to-100">its recent introduction of a $20 Golden Bottle Cap item to boost a creature's stats for the first time</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-director-talks-new-ownership-says-saudi-backing-wont-see-demands-such-as-cristiano-ronaldo-added-to-the-game-yeah-thats-a-little-bit-not-our-vibe">why the game's new Saudi-backed ownership at Scopely would not negatively impact PokÃ©mon Go</a> â€” or result in Cristiano Ronaldo being added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
