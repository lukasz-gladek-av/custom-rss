Nintendo did not share an updated kick-off date, but did promise that the June 5, 2025 release date of the Switch 2 itself remains intact.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo issued IGN the following statement:</p><blockquote>Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has confirmed the pre-order delay is specific to the U.S. In the UK, for example, Nintendo's pre-order delay remains unchanged.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-price-confirmed">Nintendo announced the Switch 2 at $449.99</a>, with a Mario Kart World bundle priced $499.99. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-costs-80-30-cheaper-if-you-buy-it-bundled-with-the-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World itself is priced $79.99</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch 2 comes with the following:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nintendo Switch 2 console</li><li>Joy-Con 2 controllers (L+R)</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Grip</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Straps</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Dock</li><li>Ultra High-Speed HDMI Cable</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter</li><li>USB-C Charging Cable</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s statement issued today raises the prospect that it could hike the price of the Switch 2 and its games further amid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-nintendo-pr-managers-say-switch-2-and-mario-kart-world-price-backlash-a-true-crisis-moment-for-nintendo">what is already an angry backlash to its next-gen pricing strategy</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking in <a href="https://youtu.be/jMibVyYvSYU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a video on their YouTube channel</a>, former Nintendo of America PR managers Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang criticized Nintendo for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-price-confirmed">the way it revealed the $449.99 price of the Switch 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-costs-80-30-cheaper-if-you-buy-it-bundled-with-the-nintendo-switch-2">the $79.99 price of Mario Kart World</a> following this week's Nintendo Direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t want to blow things out of proportion, but this does feel like a true crisis moment for Nintendo,” Ellis said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">U.S. markets tumbled today after China hit back against Donald Trump's raft of tariffs. China, which faces a 54% import tax, has retaliated with an additional 34% tax on U.S. goods from next week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moments before the U.S. markets opened, Trump said "China played it wrong, they panicked," and insisted his policies would "never change."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The world is now left facing economic uncertainty, with some mainstream news media declaring the era of cheap goods now over for the American consumer as higher tariffs are automatically passed through to inflation and higher prices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tariffs are essentially taxes placed on the cost of importing certain goods. While it's possible for companies in the supply chain to simply eat these costs, more often than not these taxes are passed onto consumers. And unfortunately for gamers, rising prices are very likely to impact tech and gaming goods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-take-on-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad had warned</a> that Trump's surprise tariffs on countries such as Vietnam, where Nintendo had shifted some of its Switch 2 manufacturing in anticipation of U.S. tariffs on China, might have caused a rethink.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset U.S. tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the Switch 2 showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world," Ahmad said. "The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced"><u>everything announced at the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive"><u>what the experts have to say about the Switch 2 price and Mario Kart World’s $80 price tag</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
