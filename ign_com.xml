            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-x-terraria-coming-in-2025-december-update-set-to-add-huge-new-island<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair has teased a major update for the game coming in December as well as a crossover with Terraria.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking to the Palworld Discord, Pocketpair said the December update adds the “largest, harshest, and most mysterious” island yet to Palworld. This new island is about six times bigger than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Sakurajima:_New_Pals_and_How_to_Access">Sakurajima</a>, which hit Palworld in June.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Don't miss it!” Pocketpair teased alongisde the screenshots, below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld December 2024 Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Pocketpair teased a surprise crossover with indie smash hit Terraria. There are no details yet, but artwork, below, shows characters from both games clasping hands. Expect whatever this is to arrive in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this comes, of course, as Pocketpair works to defend itself in a high-profile patent lawsuit filed by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. After Palworld’s huge launch earlier this year on PC and Xbox, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have gone down the patent route. They want 5 million yen (approx $32,846) each plus late payment damages, as well as an injunction against Palworld that would block its release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-reveals-patents-at-the-heart-of-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-lawsuit-and-how-much-money-its-being-sued-for"><u>Pocketpair confirmed the three Japan-based patents</u></a>, which revolve around catching Pokémon in a virtual field, that it's being sued over. Palworld <em>does</em> include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, similar to the mechanic seen in the 2022 Nintendo Switch exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus"><u>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</u></a>. One of the three patents in question is about riding on top of Pokémon (Palworld also lets players ride Pals).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One patent expert has suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-may-end-up-getting-help-from-an-unlikely-source-in-its-nintendo-patent-lawsuit-an-8-year-old-gta-5-pokmon-mod">a GTA 5 mod dating back to 2016 may be recognized as a precedent by the court</a> because it included the catching Pokémon mechanic long before Pokémon Legends: Arceus. If that happens, it could work in Palworld’s favor.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/28/gduzmzzaoamf-7t-1732804325873.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Palworld gets a Terraria crossover at some point in 2025. Image credit Pocketpair.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC earlier this year, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, signing a deal with Sony to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patent experts have said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-lawsuit-shows-just-how-seriously-nintendo-views-the-threat-of-palworld-patent-expert-says"><u>Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s lawsuit against Pocketpair is evidence of the threat posed by Palworld</u></a>, which has since gone on to launch on PS5. Pocketpair has vowed to take on Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in court, saying: “We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Did we mention the included 5-inch BFG replica? It has LED lights and a stand. Imagine looking at it and then at your TV as you chainsaw an IMP in two? Sweet, sweet nightmare fuel.</p><div catalogid="67ded308-eac3-4b1d-8d45-e9ba0d61ce40" id="212218"><div id="212218" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Doom Anthology</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Available for PS4, PS5 and Nintendo Switch</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6bVYd?object_uuid=d310af44-70ae-42ca-b8ab-dac23030feb2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Doom Anthology</a> covers the entire history of Doom, from the beginning and right up to Doom Eternal. That's six iconic games with an exclusive steel book, but let's address the elephant in the room. Yep, all the games are download codes, which, for the price tag, isn't the biggest issue in all honesty. Let's break down what's included in the Doom Anthology:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li><strong>BFG Replica</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>A <strong>5-inch model of the iconic Big F</strong>*ing Gun**, complete with LED lights and a display stand.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Exclusive SteelBook Case</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Premium artwork celebrating Doom's legacy, making this a stunning addition to any collection.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Six Games</strong></li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">Games Breakdown</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>DOOM (1993)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>The FPS classic that revolutionized gaming. Known for its fast-paced action and revolutionary 3D graphics (even though they weren't true 3D!), DOOM popularized multiplayer deathmatches. Did you see the game's chainsaw weapon was inspired by a real chainsaw the developers kept in their office?</li></ul></li><li><strong>DOOM II (1994)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>The sequel expanded on its predecessor with new enemies (like the deadly Arch-Vile), weapons (double-barreled shotgun, anyone?), and larger levels. It also introduced modding tools that made DOOM II one of the most modified games of all time.</li></ul></li><li><strong>DOOM 64 (1997)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>A Nintendo 64 exclusive for years, this cult hit features darker graphics and a haunting soundtrack compared to earlier entries. Fun fact: DOOM 64 introduced the "Unmaker," a demonic laser weapon not seen in any other game until DOOM Eternal.</li></ul></li><li><strong>DOOM 3 (2004)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>This reboot brought horror to the forefront with its dark corridors, jump scares, and a flashlight you couldn't use simultaneously with weapons (a controversial design choice). DOOM 3 also marked id Software's first foray into true 3D rendering.</li></ul></li><li><strong>DOOM (2016)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>This fan-favorite reboot resurrected the franchise with fast, brutal gameplay that ditched cover mechanics for relentless forward momentum. The "Glory Kill" mechanic was a game-changer, encouraging players to get up close and personal with enemies.</li></ul></li><li><strong>DOOM Eternal Deluxe Edition (2020)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>The most recent entry cranked up the chaos with more vertical movement, new weapons, and a deeper storyline. The Deluxe Edition includes DLC expansions like <em>The Ancient Gods,</em> adding hours of gameplay and even tougher challenges.</li></ul></li></ul></div><p id="doom-anthology"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Doom Anthology">Best Nintendo Switch Black Friday Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-black-friday-digital-video-game-sale-live">Nintendo Switch digital game deals</a> to consider, especially if you're <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-oled-black-friday-bundle-2024-live">picking up a console</a> too.
