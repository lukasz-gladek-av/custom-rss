Reasons for canceled games range from fast-shifting market dynamics and corporate restructuring to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/major-publishers-report-aaa-franchises-can-cost-over-a-billion-to-make"><u>ballooning development costs</u></a> and other creative challenges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2025, 17 games have been confirmed or reliably reported to be canceled so far. Each of these games is listed below, ordered chronologically by the official announcement, or a report, of its cancellation.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Transformers: Reactivate</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On January 8, 2025, it was announced that Transformers: Reactivate, an online action game in development at the Tencent-owned studio Splash Damage (Gears Tactics), was canceled. A statement shared on the studio's <a href="https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X account</a> did not provide a reason for the cancellation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This decision did not come lightly, and it is a difficult time for the studio and our people," Splash Damage said at the time. "We want to take a moment to thank the team who worked on Transformers for their dedication and passion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Transformers: Reactivate was first announced in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/transformers-reactivate-is-an-online-action-game-developed-by-splash-damage"><u>December 2022</u></a> at the Game Awards.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Two Unannounced PlayStation Live-service Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On January 16, 2025, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczNzA2ODk1MywiZXhwIjoxNzM3NjczNzUzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUTdFWjJUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.OtpjLAX_fLRPjeIhmdZSXLhsiFNDef1RlL6IxoCIQes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> reported Sony had canceled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>two unannounced PlayStation games</u></a>: a live-service project in development at Bend Studio (Days Gone) and a live-service God of War game in development at Bluepoint Games (Demon’s Souls remake).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony confirmed in a separate statement that despite the cancellations, neither Bend Studio nor Bluepoint Games would be shut down, and that Sony would work with the studios to determine their "next projects." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While reasons for the cancellations weren’t reported, the decisions may have been related to Sony’s previous efforts to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-commits-to-launch-just-six-of-playstations-12-live-service-games-by-march-2026"><u>downsize its live-service plans</u></a>.

In the aftermath of the dispute, the team evaluated the state of Earthblade and decided it wasn’t “as far along as one would expect after such a protracted development process.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio said it's now "prototyping again and exploring at our own pace, and trying to rediscover game development in a manner closer to how we approached it at Celeste's or TowerFall's inception."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Football Manager 25</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/football-manager-25-canceled-dev-apologizes-for-letting-fans-down"><u>Football Manager 25 was canceled</u></a> on February 6, 2025. It's the first time the annual sports sim has skipped a release in its 21-year history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Football Manager 25 had been delayed twice prior to the official cancellation, and the decision to end development ultimately came when developer Sports Interactive concluded it “would not achieve the standard required [to release the game], even with the adjusted timeline.” The studio specifically cited issues with “the overarching player experience and interface.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sports Interactive is expected to resume the series with the release of Football Manager 26 later this year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Wonder Woman</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In February 2025 it was announced that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-cancels-wonder-woman-game-closes-three-studios"><u>Wonder Woman game was canceled</u></a> and the developers, Monolith Productions, would be shut down. Wonder Woman would have been the studio's follow-up to its acclaimed Middle-earth seires, and was expected to utilize its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wb-games-nemesis-system-patent-was-approved-this-week-after-multiple-attempts">patented Nemesis system</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The decision came from parent company/publisher Warner Bros. amidst a corporate restructuring. In a statement, a Warner Bros. spokesperson said, “Our hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following Wonder Woman's cancellation, comic writer Gail Simone, who worked on the project, said the now-canceled game was "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/canceled-wonder-woman-was-gorgeous-and-expansive-comic-book-writer-who-consulted-on-the-game-says">gorgeous and expansive</a>," adding, "[Monolith] made sure it had WW and DC lore on every aspect of the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wonder Woman was first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-monolith-wb">announced</a> at the 2021 Game Awards.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Respawn Multiplayer FPS</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">An <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawn-has-quietly-canceled-a-multiplayer-fps-incubation-project"><u>unannounced, multiplayer first-person shooter</u></a> from Apex Legends developer Respawn Entertainment was canceled in early March 2025.

Of the 300 employees affected by the layoffs, 100 came from Respawn Entertainment, where this Titanfall project and the aforementioned multiplayer shooter were in development. No further details about the project were reported. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Titanfall is a fan-favorite FPS series that launched as a tentpole console exclusive for Microsoft’s Xbox One in 2014.

The planned mobile game was set to be an action-RPG that told a brand-new Kingdom Hearts story and would utilize Pokemon GO-like GPS mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement from Square Enix, Missing-Link was canceled once it was “determined that it would be difficult to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-and-kingdom-hearts-missing-link-announced-at-the-series-20th-anniversary-event"><u>announced</u></a> alongside Kingdom Hearts 4 in April 2022.

The cancellation, announced on May 28, 2025, came alongside the closure of Cliffhanger Games, which was developing Black Panther as its first project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to the cancellation and accompanying layoffs, EA said the decision was made to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Panther was planned as a single-player, open-world game and was led by Kevin Stephens, former studio head of the now-shuttered Monolith Productions. Cliffhanger was also comprised of veteran game developers who previously worked on titles like Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, Halo Infinite, God of War, and Call of Duty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Panther was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-announces-black-panther-game-from-some-of-the-developers-behind-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor"><u>announced</u></a> in July 2023 and was in development as part of EA's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-and-ea-sign-three-game-deal-starting-with-iron-man"><u>multi-game deal with Marvel</u></a>.

Perfect Dark was also being co-developed by Tomb Raider studio Crystal Dynamics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty confirmed the cancellation in an internal email obtained by IGN. “We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio,” it read. “As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Initiative was built from the ground-up by Xbox to be a first-party studio that set out to make "AAAA" games for Microsoft.

Rare <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/14/new-rare-game-everwild-announced"><u>announced</u></a> Everwild in November 2019, and the game was reportedly a third-person adventure set in “a natural and magical world,” though official details were never revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the cancellation, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a> reported 35-year Rare veteran Gergg Mayles would be leaving the studio.

Prior to Nintendo, Takahashi worked at Sega and Square Enix on franchises such as Sonic and Final Fantasy. Motokura, meanwhile, directed Super Mario 3D World and Super Mario Odyssey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-finally-confirmed-by-nintendo-sparking-questions-over-when-switch-2s-3d-mario-will-arrive">confirmed to IGN last month</a> that Bananza was being worked on by the team behind Super Mario Odyssey, without detailing exactly who. But now we know who the game's top developers are — and we even know <em>why </em>the game exists, as IGN was told the idea came from Odyssey producer and Nintendo legend Yoshiaki Koizumi.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And here's the part that now has fans wondering.

Now, fans believe Koizumi's absence is a sign he's being saved up for something else: the next big 3D Mario.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/cjwxadk-1752228835804.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nintendo veteran Yoshiaki Koizumi.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The fact that Koizumi (produced Galaxy 2, 3D Land, 3D World, and Odyssey) isn’t working on Bananza is proof enough that there’s a separate 3D Mario in development and that Bananza isn’t supposed to take Mario’s spot," wrote fan BiggieNephew in a <a href="https://x.com/BiggieNephew/status/1943321530487771474" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on X / Twitter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Do you think then Yoshiaki Koizumi is producing the next 3D Mario?" another fan said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"YOSHIAKI KOIZUMI ISN'T THE PRODUCER NOR THE DIRECTOR OF BANANZA!" wrote a third fan, all in caps. "NEW 3D MARIO GAME FOR SWITCH 2 IS SAVED FOR NEXT YEAR, WAHOO! WE BOTH MARIO AND DK FANS CAN COEXIST TOGETHER HAPPILY AT THE START OF THIS NEW ERA OF NINTENDO! (I Hope...)" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the arrival of another 3D Mario game at some point is assured, and none of this speculation appears to be taking away from the fact that Donkey Kong Bananza looks set to be Nintendo's next big and very promising-looking new 3D platformer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the absence of a new 3D Mario around the Switch 2's launch, and an increasingly lengthy wait for a new 3D Mario — since Odyssey's launch back in 2017 — has inevitably sparked speculation, and a hope that, alongside the upcoming delights of Donkey Kong Bananza, Nintendo's next Mario outing is still not too far away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other Donkey Kong Bananza details revealed by IGN this week include the fact <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-was-originally-a-nintendo-switch-1-game">the game started life on Nintendo Switch 1</a>, as well as fresh chatter from Nintendo on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-leads-say-the-reason-pauline-is-13-years-old-specifically-is-for-the-player-to-puzzle-out">how Bananza fits into Donkey Kong canon</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

You'll then head out onto survival missions against familiar Resident Evil foes, with Aniplex promising a "global multiplayer experience." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can watch the full showcase video just below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, it looks like the game's real-time defense battles will be single-player, but Aniplex says you'll also be able to "connect and compete in real time across the globe" with other fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Survival Unit's story begins with your player character shaking off the effects of being an Umbrella Corporation test subject, then recruiting a team of Resident Evil stars to fight back. Over time, you'll upgrade these characters by purchasing items from the Resident Evil Merchant, to take on progressively tougher threats.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/unnamed-1-1752226346639.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Leon may not (yet) be announced for Resident Evil Requiem, but he's included here.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/unnamed-1752226346640.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">How will the game be monetised? Developer Aniplex hasn't said.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Recurring Resident Evil characters such as Leon S Kennedy, Jill Valentine, Claire Redfield, and fan-favourite Resi 1 character Barry Burton are all included, alongside some deeper cuts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With her daughter set for a starring role in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, it's interesting to see the return here of Resident Evil Outbreak's Alyssa Ashcroft. Becca Woolett makes a return from Resident Evil: Resistance, while Resident Evil 2's fallen hero cop Marvin Branagh is also included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just don't expect any of the new story here to be reflected in Requiem when it arrives next year. For all Survival Unit leans on the main Resident Evil franchise, this announcement makes clear that it will be a non-canon entry to the series — meaning <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">there's no clues as to Leon's mysterious current status</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
