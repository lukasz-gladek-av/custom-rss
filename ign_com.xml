            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">DICE has outlined what it's learned — and what it's changing — following the open beta test for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With "tens of thousands connecting on Discord to play together, over 600,000 hours streamed, and over 30 million hours watched," the Battlefield team said it would "like to take a moment to look back at the recent Open Beta to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwddm7/battlefield_6_community_update_open_beta_debrief/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">share our key learnings</a> and in-game changes we’re making based on your feedback and in-game data," including tweaks to weapons, movement, maps, modes, player counts, and playlist options.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps one of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwdur5/movement_will_be_changed_for_the_final_release/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>biggest complaints from players</u></a> was around movement mechanics, particularly the speed of movement, and moving out of a slide into a jump. DICE says it's now "adjusting" this "to create a more balanced and traditional Battlefield experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Momentum, especially horizontal speed, carried from a slide into a jump has been reduced," the team wrote. "There is now a greater penalty for consecutive jumps, which lowers jump height when jumps are spammed. Firing while jumping or sliding will result in increased inaccuracy. These changes are designed to make sliding and jumping more situational, so they are no longer ideal options for engaging in gunfights, and will contribute to a gameplay pace that rewards skillful movement without becoming too fast or unpredictable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Parachute physics have also been re-tuned, with reduced initial acceleration when opening the parachute for more controlled aerial movement."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team was also keen for you to know that it heard your "strong feedback" about larger-scale maps, and says that while the Open Beta intentionally featured smaller, more fast-paced maps, "larger-scale maps are already part of our package, delivering action-packed gameplay and memorable, unique moments for every player." As Battlefield Labs continues — that's the closed test available to select players who sign an NDA — it'll introduce two new multiplayer maps: one set in Mirak Valley, the other a remake of the fan-favorite from Battlefield 3, Operation Firestorm. These two maps "include the full complement of vehicles, like Liberation Peak, along with a more vast combat space." Details about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/much-bigger-battlefield-6-maps-leak-online-following-datamine"><u>Mirak, you may remember, leaked earlier this week</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And of course, the studio is looking at feedback on modes, too. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-knows-you-dont-like-rush-mode-and-has-already-cut-mcom-timers-by-33"><u>DICE recently made changes to Rush mode after a negative response from fans</u></a>, noting "the conversation we observed wasn’t just about player count, but also about how maps play, and the tactical experience they offer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who aren't aware, Rush was initially known as Gold Rush in Bad Company, where matches typically ranged from 12v12 to 16v16 players. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’ve experimented with larger player counts over the years, such as 64- and even 128-player versions. While these matches created intense, fast-paced moments, they also led to issues: Overwhelming defenses, stalled frontlines, and too many games ending in the first sector," DICE explained. "Rush is especially sensitive to higher player counts due to its tactical and strategic requirements; when a player tries to arm the M-COM while more than 20 opponents are defending, the intended gameplay becomes less tangible. Based on feedback throughout recent titles, we’re lowering the default player count for Rush to improve the flow of combat and restore the tactical, methodical experience that defines the mode."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who enjoy a "large-scale" Rush, however, will still be able to "experiment" with different player counts via the Portal from launch. "Finding the right balance is an ongoing process as everyone gets familiar with map size, lanes, and combat spaces," the team added. "For now, we’ve found that 8v8 provides a solid starting point for small-scale, fast-paced modes like Team Death Match, Squad Death Match, Domination, and KOTH."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With the insights gathered during the Open Beta play sessions, we will be introducing in-game adjustments in upcoming Battlefield Labs events. Stay tuned for progress updates and future opportunities to get involved," the team concluded. "Lastly, thanks again for joining the Battlefield 6 Open Beta. Your feedback and participation made it an incredible experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're having a great time with what we've played so far, writing in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer"><u>Battlefield 6 review-in-progress</u></a>: "We are still in the beta period, but I’m already having an absolute blast with Battlefield 6’s multiplayer. The action is sublime, with a cinematic quality to the constantly raining debris that is enhanced by how legitimately effective it is to take strategic advantage of that destruction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Right now, even in beta form, Battlefield 6 might be the most fun shooter I’ve played this year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't forget that from now until October 7 — Battlefield 6's launch day — EA has a "wave of content" planned for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-2042"><u>Battlefield 2042</u></a>, including a free new pass "celebrating the legacy of Battlefield," new hardware, and a reimagining of the fan favorite Iwo Jima map. As you progress through the 'Road to Battlefield 6' pass, you can expect 50 "exclusive cross-rewards," including 20 for Battlefield 6 that will be ready for you on launch day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Whether recruit, normal, hardened, or veteran, long-term COD players know their level. But this year’s entry, Black Ops 7, won’t let you pick.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 7 has a campaign that can be played solo or in co-op for up to four players. As part of that, the difficulty scales based on how many are playing, and cannot be adjusted in the settings.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“For the difficulty, it's baked in," associate creative director Miles Leslie told IGN in a recent interview. “We've built it for solo or four-player squads as well. You cannot pick a difficulty like past games. We've baked it in because you have to approach a co-op campaign differently, and we wanted to make sure the missions felt right for solo players — we're not forgetting about you, we love you — but also because it is a social experience we want to make sure it's fun, but the right amount of challenging for two, three, and four players as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, no more veteran-level runs for single-player fans in this year's Call of Duty. Are you someone who enjoys testing yourself with the toughest challenges COD campaigns have to offer? Are you disappointed by the fact that Black Ops 7 won’t have this option at launch? </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Opening Night Live 2025 Reveal Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, you can check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-isnt-lazy-its-the-series-biggest-swing-in-years"><u>my full preview of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</u></a> For more from the devs, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-responds-to-lazy-claims-theres-always-going-to-be-people-that-try-to-knock-you-down"><u>their thoughts on Call of Duty being called "lazy</u></a>," the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-paying-attention-to-community-feedback-on-goofy-skins"><u>proliferation of “goofy skins,”</u></a> and<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-responds-to-generative-ai-backlash-not-replace-but-streamline"> <u>how generative AI is being used in Black Ops</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.
