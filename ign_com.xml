There's something so satisfying about holding a guitar controller and feeling like I'm actually playing songs that I would never dream of playing on a real guitar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While my own Rock Band days ended a long time ago, the music goes on with the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/05/rock-band-4-review">Rock Band 4</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-festival-review">Fortnite Festival</a>. And if you want to keep playing those games or get back into them, PDP released a new wireless guitar controller just last year that can help you do that. It's pretty expensive, but Amazon has just dropped the price to a new low with a 20% discount.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PDP Riffmaster Wireless Guitar Controller Sale</h2><div catalogid="1620c457-409e-42b8-91af-d7f30570614f" id="214952"><div id="214952" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PDP Riffmaster Wireless Guitar Controller</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When this controller first came out back in May 2024, it sold out very quickly. This is largely because there just aren't really any new guitar controller options available outside of this one. The compatibility with Rock Band 4 and Fortnite Festival allow new and old players to experience an upgrade that feels more in line with modern controllers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it is normally priced at $129.99, the discount Amazon is running right now drops that down to $104. This is the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CWS8WKS5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest-ever price we've seen on Amazon</a> for the PlayStation compatible version of this controller, and likely the lowest one we'll see until sales events later in the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is a fairly unique controller, it's the overall <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-controller">best PS5 controller</a> you can buy if you're looking to play Rock Band 4 or Fortnite Festival on your PS5 or PS4.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-players-share-love-and-fear-for-its-new-flagship-monster-arkveld<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">You've been thunderstruck.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Monster Hunter Wilds beta is back, and it's got a few new fights in tow. Beta players are already grappling with its big challenge, a fearsome new foe called Arkveld, and its eliciting both excitement and dread.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arkveld is the new flagship monster for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. This means the beast is the cover star for the game, and stands to play a significant role in the course of players' journeys through Wilds. As part of the new beta test, courageous hunters can try to tackle a hunt for the Chained Arkveld, with a 20-minute time limit and five "faint" limit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As ambitious players are discovering, this new monster packs a punch. Arkveld is a massive winged beast, with electric chains stretching out from each of its arms. It can swing them around and make the air crackle with its thunderous attacks, and it's surprisingly fast, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Experienced hunters <a href="https://x.com/KeithMontalbo/status/1887717556322279689" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>are still finding themselves sent back in a cart</u></a> by its powerful moves. It's an impressive display of the new technology, as Arkveld uses its whips to move around, throw out long-reaching attacks, and generally be a menace. One attack in particular has Monster Hunter players in the beta thunderstruck, as it grabs the hunter and roars at them before slamming them down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arkveld is even causing some mild unexpected havoc. I really <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1ijrpqw/arkveld_is_having_none_of_that/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>enjoyed this video one player on the r/MHWilds subreddit captured</u></a>, of Arkveld interrupting their meal. The wilds are no place to go for lunch, it seems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a visually impressive fight and an incredibly dangerous monster. While the difficulty might be worrisome for some, the Monster Hunter faithful seem spurred on by it. Taking down big, dangerous monsters is the name of the game after all, and seeing Wilds' flagship monster be so fearsome and iconic in equal measure is a reaffirming notion. Additionally, the "Chained" note — plus Arkveld's flagship status — has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1ijmvau/comment/mbfj5yn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some players considering</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1ijmvau/comment/mbfh1n4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whether there could be</a> an even more terrifying "Unchained" version down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/obt/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test 2</u></a> runs February 6 through 9, and then returns February 13 through 16. Both Arkveld and returning monster Gypceros are available to hunt, and there are some other added features, like a Training Area and Private Lobbies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds will be out on February 28, 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.
