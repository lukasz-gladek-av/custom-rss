In that small sliver of footage, fans saw signs that the much-sought-after return of Lagiacrus could be happening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right at the end of the Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase, over the Title Update 2 text, we hear some aquatic sounds, followed by a telltale clawed foot and scales. The signs feel fairly obvious that this is going to be Lagiacrus, a monster that hunters have been eager to fight again for quite some time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Introduced in Monster Hunter 3, a.k.a. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-3-tri">Monster Hunter Tri</a>, Lagi was the "flagship monster" for the game, which meant it appeared on the box art. Alongside being the posterboy for Tri, the monster was fairly unique for one key reason: it incorporated underwater fighting. Submerged bouts were a big thing for Monster Hunter Tri, and Lagi was the prime example of that. Later versions in Monster Hunter Generations moved the fight back onto land, and the monster has been largely unseen since.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At one point, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190910120310/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/lagiacrus-was-prototyped-for-monster-hunter-world" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capcom confirmed it had prototyped a new Lagiacrus fight</a> for Monster Hunter: World, even showing <a href="https://x.com/johntv/status/976962161116196864" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some visual confirmation of it</a> during a GDC 2018 panel. It was ultimately pulled, though some of its tech was incorporated in another monster, Jyuratodus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the time spent apart has not dulled players' love for Lagiacrus. For some, Monster Hunter Tri was a big entrance into the series. And this fight, with its fairly unique look and mechanics, the possibilities for a Lagiacrus fight are simply exciting. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/13gt78b/why_does_everyone_seem_to_be_obsessed_with/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one user pointed out</a> several years ago in a thread asking why people are so excited for Lagi, "People who wish for Lagiacrus to return generally mean for underwater combat to return also, it's sort of a package deal."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unique mechanics aside, Lagiacrus has remained popular in its own right. The leviathan came in third in a <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/20th/en/vote-monster/result/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popularity poll for Monster Hunter's 20th anniversary</a>, beaten out only by No. 2 Nergigante and No. 1 Zinogre. One of its variants, Abyssal Lagiacrus, also came in 12th, beating out Monter Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1 addition Mizutsune at 14th.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-26-1742912521189.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lagiacrus looks like it's on the way to Monster Hunter Wilds.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2022, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-lagiacrus-not-in-game-why-explained">speaking to IGN</a>, Monster Hunter producer explained why Lagiacrus wouldn't see a return in the current game at the time, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak. Though the producer acknowledged the "desire is definitely there," the technical implementation is difficult.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Unfortunately Lagiacrus is just a very technological…difficult monster to implement. It's very snake-like, its parts are all kind of touching the ground at different moments,” Tsujimoto explained at the time. “So it's very like a writhing sort of ground-based monster.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet now, Capcom has elected to bring the writhing monster back. Whether this is a solely land affair, a new variant, or we see some sort of implementation of water mechanics all remains to be seen. Fans, however, are certainly enthused. Refrains of Lagiacrus being "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1jjkbni/comment/mjno4nj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peak</a>" and patient fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1jjkbni/comment/mjnswza/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrating their apparently successful manifestations</a> litter the comments sections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll get more details as we move past Title Update 1 and on towards the summer window for Title Update 2. But yes, it looks like Lagiacrus is going to lead the summer festivities in Monster Hunter Wilds, and that's some very exciting news for hunters new and old.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-everything-announced-for-title-update-1<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom hosted a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> Showcase today, spotlighting everything coming to its latest entry in the Monster Hunter series. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-has-a-release-date-and-loads-more-details-title-update-2-set-for-summer-2025">Alongside a look at Title Update 1</a>, we also got news about more cosmetic DLC, some surprise additions, and the next Title Update on the way too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Title Update 1 arrives on April 4, 2025, as a free update for all owners of Monster Hunter Wilds. In tandem with the launch, several pieces of free and paid DLC will be going live as well. A new hub will expand the hang-out potential for hunters, new armor and cosmetic pieces shake up the fashion game, and more fearsome monsters await on the horizon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've now got a date, details, and more for the next big update in Monster Hunter Wilds. What part of the update are you most looking forward to? Let us know down below!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">A New Hub For Hunters</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-14-1742912741311.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The showcase started with a look at the new endgame hub for hunting parties. Dubbed the Grand Hub, there are plenty of new things to do in the area. Feast together, arm wrestle, or listen to the Diva sing at night. There's also a Barrel Bowling mini-game, which you can obtain vouchers for through various activities, and more rewards to be earned through it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Grand Hub can be unlocked once you're Hunter Rank 16 by talking to Tetsuzan in Suja, the Peaks of Accord.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mizutsune Arrives</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-15-1742912686820.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As confirmed, the big addition for Title Update 1 is the bubbly monster Mizutsune. It's got swift tail strikes, water jets, and many other moves ready to burst your bubble when it arrives in Title Update 1. Once you've reached HR 21 or above, head to the Scarlet Forest and talk to Kanya for the quest. And of course, there's some new gear to make from the hunt.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Additional Hunts on the Way</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A new Event Quest will bring Arch-tempered Rey Dau to Monster Hunter Wilds. Arch-tempered is a scale above the usual Tempered fight, making this a potentially challenging bout. You'll have to be HR 50 or above to challenge it, and new armor awaits those who can clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zoh Shia is also getting its own fight. Previously, you'd only fight Zoh Shia once, as part of the main story. With the new update, you'll be able to re-fight Zoh Shia through new quests after reaching HR 50, and craft new armor from it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arena Quests</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Speedrunners get their own challenge to tackle in Arena Quests, which will allow hunters to compete for the fastest clear times. Both Challenge Quests and Free Challenge Quests will be available, with pendants given out for participation and achievement alike. You can access them through the counter in the new Grand Hub.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Change Alma's Outfit</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the hardest-working handlers around is finally getting some cosmetic options. You'll be able to change Alma's attire through an appearance menu in camp, and one new outfit is being given out for free. After completing a certain side mission, you can also change out Alma's glasses.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-21-1742913507424.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">More DLC is on the way</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A mix of free and paid DLC is arriving in tandem with Title Update 1. Some additions, like some classic gestures from Monster Hunters prior, will be made freely available for hunters in the store. Others, like those in the Cosmetic DLC Pack 1, are available through the store, or for those who picked up the Cosmetic DLC Pass or Premium Deluxe Edition. New stickers, looks for Alma, and even more are on the way.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-23-1742912586790.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">More Event Quests and Seasonal Events</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even more Event Quests are on the way, alongside Seasonal Events. The latter are special windows of time where the Grand Hub will change appearance, and available meals will also change. LImited equipment, gestures, decorations, and more are available during these Seasonal Events.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Seasonal Events kick off with the Festival of Accord: Blossomdance on April 23, adding pink cherry blossoms and some new decor to the game. Capcom confirmed that most previously available events and Event Quests should return in the future, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Roadmap Ahead</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-24-1742912549128.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's how Title Update 1 and its related content will roll out over the coming months. Title Update 1 arrives on April 3 for U.S. players, with the Blossomdance starting on April 22. On April 29, the challenging new Arch-tempered Rey Dau arrives, and by end of May, some other features and a Capcom collaboration will debut.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-march-2025-26-1742912521189.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To end the show, we also got a tease of the upcoming Title Update 2, due to arrive this summer. No firm date has been announced just yet, but we did get a brief image that teases the possible return of a long-awaited monster: Lagiacrus, the underwater leviathan, who looks to be causing some chaos on the surface.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest in Capcom's long-running monster-fighting series <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-surpasses-8-million-units-sold-in-3-days-and-is-the-fastest-capcom-game-to-do-so">brought in some big numbers with its launch</a>, and with Title Update 1, the company will be setting the cadence for how it moves forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help get your Monster Hunter Wilds adventure started, take a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Things_Monster_Hunter_Wilds_Doesn%27t_Tell_You_-_Tips">what Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t tell you</a>, and a guide to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Weapons">all 14 weapon types</a> in the game.
