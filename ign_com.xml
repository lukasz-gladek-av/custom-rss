The only way to beat geniuses is to give yourself up entirely to what you wanna accomplish."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/03/sh2-blogroll-1727928592088.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Pyramid Head creator Masahiro Ito was too busy for a girlfriend when developing Silent Hill.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Ito didn't say he regrets his time working on the series, which is currently enjoying a resurgence thanks to the criticially and commercially acclaimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Ito has been blunt about the series in the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/someone-bought-silenthillcom-to-troll-konami">"I wish I hadn't designed f**kin Pyramid Head,"</a> he said in a 2022 post. This comes alongside criticism of publisher Konami too. "To use [Pyramid Head] in so many titles makes [Pyramid Head] cheaper," Ito said in a now deleted post.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami partnered with developer Bloober Team to recreate the game where Pyramid Head debuted. It arrived October 8 to glowing critical reception <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-1-million-copies-in-less-than-a-week">and strong sales too</a>, leaving many fans of the previously dormant horror franchise eager for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review">In our 8/10 review</a>, IGN said: "Silent Hill 2 is a great way to visit – or revisit – one of the most dread-inducing destinations in the history of survival horror."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
