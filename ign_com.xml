            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/survival-rpg-enshrouded-gets-big-new-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The survival action RPG Enshrouded just launched a new update called Souls of the Frozen Frontier, and it adds lots of new content. There’s a new region with new loot and quests, a higher level cap, new crafting tier, new dynamic weather changes, and lots more. It’s the biggest update since the game launched in early access.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For the uninitiated, Enshrouded is a third-person survival game that takes place in Embervale, a massive open world that up to 16 players can explore at once. The game world is entirely made out of voxels, and you can terraform the world around you to build a base, castle, or even a village block by block. There are tons of options to build your ideal home. Want an underground lair? You can build that. How about a base inside a mountain cave? You can do that too. Or maybe you’d prefer a treehouse. You guessed it, you can do that too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not as concerned with all that and would prefer to build something quickly, then no worries. There are pre-made elements like building blocks and furniture you can use to easily get a base up and running. Regardless of how you go about creating your base, you can then bring friendly NPCs back to it to help you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you first start a new game, you’ll have nothing but the clothes on your back. You’ll need to gather materials to craft new gear, or you can find valuable loot in the Shroud, a dangerous area full of monsters and covered in fog that will kill you if you stay in it too long. So you need to get in, gather loot, and get out before falling victim to the monsters or fog.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/30/en-wild-cyclops-logo-1730321591648.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s action RPG combat, so you’ll choose from a variety of weapons and make use of dodges and parries to avoid damage and take down enemies. As you progress, you’ll unlock the ability to specialize in one of three classes: Trickster, Battlemage, or Survivor, each with its own sub-classes for further specialization. In addition to dealing with monsters and the harsh environment, you’ll also need to stay fed and hydrated to be at your best. It’s a survival game at heart, after all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enshrouded launched in early access on PC in January, and Souls of the Frozen Frontier marks the most significant update to the game since. The biggest addition is a large new explorable region called the Albaneve Summits, which brings with it new environments, building materials, quests, lore, collectibles, and wildlife.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The region is designed to challenge even the strongest and best-equipped players. There are lots of new enemies with new attacks and tactics to keep you on your toes. And the new environments include ice and deep snow, which will require you to use caution while you explore. The ice is slippery, and you can get stuck in the deep snow.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/30/en-new-playable-area-2-logo-1730314076632.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not just the new environments you’ll need to contend with. The update also added dynamic weather changes, like rain and extreme cold, that can be dangerous for the unprepared. There are new crafting recipes, so you’ll need to make some gear to protect yourself from the cold.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/30/en-armor1-logo-1730314118231.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of crafting, the update added a new crafting tier with recipes that use new materials introduced with the Albaneve Summits. You can also now craft new fitting gear for the game’s various classes and sub-classes. The overall level cap has also been raised to 35, which adds new levels for spells, new skills, and new types of perks that can be unlocked during character progression.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve always been able to craft and then equip different gliders on your back that let you travel through the air at high speeds. But the Albaneve Summits add a new traversal mechanic: updrafts on mountainsides, which let you gain height while gliding so you can stay airborne longer. It’s great for traveling across large sections of the area quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Souls of the Frozen Frontier also brings some changes to your base. If you’ve played Enshrouded and wanted your base to feel more lively, then we have some good news. There are new NPCs across Embervale you can bring back to your base, and as you add more people, you’ll get new stories, quests, and dialogue. There are also new assistants you can add to your secondary bases who will provide access to all the recipes of the original crafting NPCs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More interested in filling your base with animals? Well, you can do that too. There’s new wildlife to tame and bring home to your farm, and there are some previously existing non-aggressive animals that can be tamed and added to your base for the first time. If the animals you bring home are fed and comfortable, they can settle down and start a family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also new pets — including cats and dogs — you can find across Embervale who can call your base home if you build up enough trust with them. And in case you’re curious — yes, you can pet your farm animals and pets.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/30/en-pet-cat-logo-1730314198508.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Enshrouded is available in early access now <a href="https://connect.enshrouded.com/IGN_Update4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Steam</a>, and the Souls of the Frozen Frontier update comes included at no additional cost.
