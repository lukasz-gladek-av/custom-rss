            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The card-based, narrative-driven RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3117820/_/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Sultan’s Game</u></a> just dropped its latest update alongside new DLC. There’s new story content, a downloadable soundtrack, new cards, and the base game is on sale for 15% as part of the Steam Summer Sale right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who aren’t familiar with Sultan’s Game, the story begins with a tyrannical sultan who has experienced every vice and pleasure life has to offer, and he’s grown bored. But then a mysterious sorceress arrives with a card game meant only for the realm’s most powerful people. Each round of the game assigns you a Sultan Card and tasks you with destroying it, but each card has different requirements to defeat it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cards come in four different types with four different tiers within those types. The four card types are Carnality, Bloodshed, Conquest, and Extravagance. You sate Carnality cards with nights of passion, feed the hunger of Bloodshed cards with living sacrifices, fulfill Conquest cards by capturing locations, and satisfy Extravagance cards with wealth and treasure.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/stone-carnality-card-description-1751305123213.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Each card also comes in one of four tiers of increasing value: stone, bronze, silver, and gold. To defeat a Sultan Card, you must use a card of equal or higher value. So, for instance, if you need to destroy a silver Bloodshed card, then you must kill a character card that’s either silver or gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the game is played with cards, in-world those cards represent real people, so sacrificing cards means killing actual subjects. As you might expect, this is just the kind of game a tyrannical ruler would love. But you don’t play as the sultan — at least, not after the tutorial. You are one of his courtiers who had the courage to call out the game for its cruelty and depravity. Your punishment? The sultan puts you in charge of playing the game and having to make life-or-death decisions to defeat each Sultan Card. If you fail, he’ll execute you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The beginning of each round will see you draw a new Sultan Card, and you’ll have seven days to figure out how to destroy it. There are activities available each day, and you can choose which activities to send cards in your deck to do. But you’ll need to be strategic about which activities you do each day and which cards you assign to them. Seven days can go by quickly, and there are limited resources at your disposal.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/overworld-map-1751305170813.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of those activities require dice rolls to determine if your chosen cards are successful. When you end the day, text-based scenes will play out based on who did what, whether they were successful, and your rewards. The primary rewards are gold coins (which can be used to gain access to other activities) or information cards (which can be used for a variety of things), but as the game progresses, more events get added with more varied results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, the story will be shaped by how you decide to approach each task and how moral or immoral you choose to be. Will you willingly go along with the sultan or secretly plot behind his back? Will you stay loyal to your wife or spend your free time at the local brothel? How will you treat the strangers that cross your path?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/story-choice-1751305201280.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter what decisions you make, butterfly effects will follow in their wake, some of which won’t show themselves until long after you’ve made the initial choice. Some decisions might seem innocuous at first, but the story branches they open can continue branching from there and end up with wildly different outcomes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of these decisions will test your morality. That starts as soon as the game begins, when you choose the background of your main character and his wife. Are you kind and charming or strong and intimidating? Are you a slave owner (this is a sultan’s court, after all) or a more enlightened friend of the nobility? Your starting deck and stats will be determined by the choices you make during this setup, but the moral decisions only get more complicated from there.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/personal-background-1751304762377.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We won’t give any spoilers here, but we will say that there are some truly dark and extreme choices you can make, and they can dramatically alter the course of the story and the things you experience in your playthrough. You’ll have to grapple with questions like, “Who am I willing to kill?” and “What makes one person’s life more valuable than another?” Some moments might elicit excitement, others fear, and others maybe even disgust. A single playthrough takes about 10 hours, but seeing every ending can easily run you to 150+ hours, so there are lots of different paths to take.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story has an extensive script, and the latest update refined that script. It also added new Steam badges, community items, and 10 new cards crowdsourced from the community (pictured below). But the biggest new additions come in the form of two DLCs: a downloadable soundtrack and prequel story.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/items-being-added-1751304688733.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The OST features 15 original tracks by Zeta and international artists, and it’s a fusion of Uyghur Muqam, guzheng, and Western orchestration that’s meant to represent the cross-cultural atmosphere of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The prequel DLC is a digital novella called A Game for the Sultan, which will let fans read the original story that inspired development of the game. Written by the game’s lead writer, it takes place in the sultan’s court, tells a standalone story, and delves into the origin of the dreaded Sultan Cards and how they first corrupted a sultan’s court.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/novel-capsule-1751304712045.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Sultan’s Game and its DLCs are currently exclusive to PC and are available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3117820/_/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Steam</u></a>. The base game sold more than 600,000 units within its first month of release and is now approaching 1 million sales during the Steam Summer Sale. It’s also reviewed well on Steam, currently sitting at “very positive” with more than 16,000 reviews and “overwhelmingly positive” with 1,600 recent reviews. You can stay up to date on the latest info by following developer <a href="https://x.com/Doublecross_X" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Double Cross Studio on Twitter</u></a>.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/card-based-rpg-sultans-game-releases-new-update-and-dlcs]]></content:encoded>

"But at the same time, there was also a loneliness in thinking, 'I won’t be able to work with these people anymore…' That said, with only a few years left until retirement anyway, and since game development often takes many years, I felt a stronger desire to move forward at my own pace, doing more freely creative things."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While reading that may come as a surprise, it seems that sentiment is shared by many former Nintendo employees.
