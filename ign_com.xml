And once again, the griefing concerns Ornithopters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Funcom launched Dune: Awakening's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-dev-funcom-is-already-testing-a-radical-change-to-the-pvp-deep-desert-experience"><u>Public Test Client </u></a>and then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-patch-11017-makes-big-changes-to-improve-deep-desert-endgame-experiences-for-all-players"><u>extended the PvE zone of the Deep Desert from about 10% of the map to 50%</u></a>. It followed an AMA in which the studio told players frustrated by the endgame experience that it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-developer-is-formulating-a-plan-to-improve-pvp-and-toxic-deep-desert-experiences"><u>"formulating a plan" to improve PvP in the Deep Desert</u></a>. Previously, players branded the endgame as "toxic" due to griefing even after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-patches-out-orni-squishing-in-pvp-by-completely-removing-the-ability-to-damage-players-and-npcs-with-vehicles-and-not-all-fans-are-happy-about-it"><u>the ability for players to squish each other with their Ornithopter</u></a> was supposedly patched out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But despite Funcom's mitigations, unscrupulous players have discovered <em>another</em> way to grief players by landing their Ornis on top of unsuspecting players — this time to prevent them from farming. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"All the griefers are now coming into Hagga to farm spice. They're doing the same thumper and land on thopter technique they perfected in [Deep Desert]. But now they're using it to farm all the minor nodes in Hagga," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lnop0k/griefing_is_now_in_hagga/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a> one aggrieved fan over the weekend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This game has some massive issues ahead. Griefers are in an all-out war against everyone else on their server, and yet there's zero way for solos to band together to stop it. And as a Dune fan, I don't think planting a thumper and then having four thopters land on you is part of the mythology."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">u/RandoFinder then edited their post to add: "I kept my Thopter at 730 km for 30 minutes until a spice blow, and as soon as I moved, four thopters were chasing me. JFC, y'all are pathetic. This was in Hagga. I had players tonight telling each other to doxx me when I stood up to them in Hagga chat. I've been in WoW general and other horrible chats, but Dune general is the most toxic chat that I've ever seen."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think it goes without saying that PVP is PVP, and killing other players in a PVP zone is totally legitimate and expected," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lnop0k/comment/n0guz4x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>responded</u></a> another player. "Entrapping someone by abusing game mechanics intended to prevent grief of a similar kind, ala pinning people with ornithopters that otherwise can't be destroyed or escaped in a PVE zone, is griefing. Griefing should be explicitly and implicitly disallowed. If you're in a PVE zone, you should not have to worry about players killing you through an abuse of mechanics."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dune: Awakening Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of writing, there has been no public response from Funcom about the issue. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dune: Awakening has enjoyed a superb launch, with a 'very positive' user review rating on Steam.
