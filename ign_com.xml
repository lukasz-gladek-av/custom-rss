            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/why-a-new-domain-discovery-is-getting-persona-4-fans-excited-for-a-possible-remake<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After the success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, it's easy to see why fans would hope for Atlus to move ahead to its next entry in the Persona series. Now, with the discovery of a domain registration, hopes that we'll see a Persona 4 remake are that much higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/ScrambledFaz/status/1902715312379752726" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber Faz</a>, a domain for "p4re.jp" was recently registered. While normally not something to get excited about, Faz noted that several years ago, "p3re.jp" was registered a few months before the official reveal of Persona 3 Reload.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>p4re. jp was registered a few hours ago.</p><p>2 years ago, p3re. jp was registered. 3 months later Persona 3 Reload was revealed <a href="https://t.co/FjuhAkr76q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/FjuhAkr76q</a></p></div>— Faz (@ScrambledFaz) <a href="https://twitter.com/ScrambledFaz/status/1902715312379752726?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Rumors of a Persona 4 remake have <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/persona-4-remake-reportedly-in-development-reliable-sega-leaker-wait-a-while/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swirled around the gaming sphere</a> for a while, but a domain does lend a bit more credence to the idea. Though it's not the only older game in the Persona series that could use a refresh — the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/24/persona-2-innocent-sin-review">Persona 2 duology</a>, in particular would be nice to see — Persona 4 and the enhanced Vita port <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-4-golden">Persona 4 Golden</a> do hold a special place in many RPG players' hearts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona 3 Reload <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review">successfully brought the PlayStation 2 classic to new audiences</a>, becoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-becomes-fastest-selling-game-in-atlus-history-with-1-million-sales">one of the fastest-selling games in Atlus history</a>. Add on the eminent popularity of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5 and its Royal edition</a>, and a Persona 4 remake would make a lot of sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, nothing's been confirmed or even teased yet on Atlus' side. While a domain registration certainly feels like it could be the canary in the Persona mines, we'll have to see if this pans out or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
