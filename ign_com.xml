Amazon UK has launched invite-only requests for the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgdRp?object_uuid=5d359ff3-18ec-4f4b-b484-0448d2997517&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box</u></a>, along with making it available for just £44.99 — 50% down from its current market price of £89.99.</p><div catalogid="0c4f0870-5ff8-4d3d-93d5-141ee6241ec6" id="222294"><div id="222294" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This follows Amazon UK’s ongoing effort to level the playing field for Pokémon fans. Previously, invite systems were introduced for sets like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-amazon-invite-requests-151-and-prismatic-evolutions-sets-uk"><u>151 and Prismatic Evolutions</u></a>, helping to sidestep the scalper-fueled frenzy that’s made collecting these cards increasingly difficult. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The invite system doesn’t guarantee a purchase, but it does mean you don’t have to constantly refresh pages or pay inflated third-party prices just to get a fair shot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box is packed with value that makes the effort worthwhile. Inside, you’ll find nine booster packs from the expansion, each containing 10 game cards and a Basic Energy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A full-art foil promo card featuring Team Rocket’s Wobbuffet headlines the exclusive contents, tapping into the expansion’s narrative focus on the return of Team Rocket. Alongside the boosters, you’ll get 65 themed card sleeves, 45 Energy cards, a set of damage-counter dice, two plastic condition markers, and a competition-legal coin-flip die.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The set also includes a collector’s box designed to keep your growing stash of cards organised. It also comes with four internal dividers, a player’s guide to help you navigate the Destined Rivals expansion, and a code card for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-live"><u>Pokemon TCG Live</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between the gameplay tools, promo card, and themed design, this Trainer Box follows the appeal of those from past sets to offer both style and substance. So, it’s ideal for seasoned battlers and collectors alike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To request an invite, simply visit the product page on Amazon UK and click the “Request Invite” button. If selected, Amazon will email you a link that’s valid for 72 hours, giving you a private window to make your purchase. Once your invite is submitted, it remains active for up to 12 months and will still apply for any future restocks. There’s no need to re-request.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon’s Pokemon TCG invites don’t stop with the Elite Trainer Box, either. Other items currently available via request include extra products in the Destined Rivals set and beyond — including the<a href="https://zdcs.link/aebB4w?object_uuid=5d359ff3-18ec-4f4b-b484-0448d2997517&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u> Prismatic Evolutions Accessory Pouch Special Collection (£29.99)</u></a>, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8b0M?object_uuid=5d359ff3-18ec-4f4b-b484-0448d2997517&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Kanghaskhan-featured Destined Rivals 3-Pack Blister (£12.99)</u></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yDLxP?object_uuid=5d359ff3-18ec-4f4b-b484-0448d2997517&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Destined Rivals Booster Bundle (£23.94)</u></a>, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3Gdr2?object_uuid=5d359ff3-18ec-4f4b-b484-0448d2997517&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>151 Booster Bundle (£17.96)</u></a>, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRe3x?object_uuid=5d359ff3-18ec-4f4b-b484-0448d2997517&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Prismatic Evolutions Super-Premium Collection (£89.99)</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As stock shortages persist across the TCG space, Amazon’s lottery-style system may not be perfect, but it’s a better alternative than bots scooping up inventory in seconds. For those chasing Destined Rivals or building out their Team Rocket-themed decks, this invite could be your best shot at a fair-priced, fully loaded box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-owner-sony-files-opposition-to-naughty-cat-trademark-application-says-dog-and-cat-are-highly-similar<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Are the words “dog” and “cat” similar enough to cause confusion? Naughty Dog owner Sony thinks they are, and has used that as the basis of an official opposition to a trademark application for ‘Naughty Cat.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony Interactive Entertainment has filed a Notice of Opposition with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) against the “Naughty Cat” trademark application filed by a company called Naughty Cat Co., Limited.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Hong Kong-based company has two apps listed on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/naughty-cat-co-limited/id1628955285" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>, both gambling “games” that promise to reward users with real cash. That’s a world away from the likes of The Last of Us and Uncharted, but that hasn’t stopped Sony’s lawyers from baring their teeth and barking angrily at their feline competitor.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/05/blog-header-copy-1749129008183.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Naughty Dog trademark has been in use for years. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In documents reviewed by IGN, Sony’s lawyers argue that the Naughty Cat trademark is “confusingly similar” to the Naughty Dog trademark it owns “in overall commercial impression and connotation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The first, dominant element of the two marks, NAUGHTY, is identical,” Sony said. “The second elements, DOG and CAT, are highly similar in that both refer to house pets and are likely to mislead consumers into believing, mistakenly, that Naughty Cat is affiliated with SIE and/or Naughty Dog or that its goods are licensed or approved by SIE and/or Naughty Dog.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The opposition note goes on to insist that any registration of the Naughty Cat trademark is “likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake or to deceive the public as to the source of Applicant’s goods offered under Applicant’s Mark, to the harm and damage of SIE and the public.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Registration of Applicant’s Mark will lead the public to conclude, incorrectly, that Applicant is or has been affiliated or connected with SIE, and/or that Applicant’s goods provided under Applicant’s Mark are or have been authorized, sponsored, endorsed, or licensed by SIE. Issuance of any registration to Applicant for the proposed mark will result in damage to SIE and the public.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of this, the Naughty Cat application claims a first use date of December 25, 2023. The Naughty Dog trademark was of course in use many years beforehand.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/05/gettyimages-2193205407-1749128826313.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Here's a picture of a cat and a dog actually getting along.

Naughty Cat Co., Limited has until July 12 to answer Sony’s opposition. If it fails to do that, the USPTO may mark the application as abandoned and Sony will have their victory. If not, the dispute may go to trial in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems unlikely any of the developers at Naughty Dog will have much of anything to do with this trademark business. Neil Druckmann and co are busy working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-developer-naughty-dog-working-on-a-second-unannounced-game-other-than-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-neil-druckmann-confirms">a second, secret, unannounced project</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don’t know anything about it yet. Perhaps it’s about cats?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
