The superhero team are sitting in the Fantasticar, and we also see the Baxter Building in the background.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/02/mr-1735838364222.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Fantastic Four's design for Marvel Rivals.

One early question fans have is whether H.E.R.B.I.E. is playable alongside the main Fantastic Four members. We'll find out soon enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that the Fantastic Four image also includes what look like bats flying across a sky lit by a blood-red moon. Could this vampiric tease suggest Blade is coming in Season 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals is a smash hit for NetEase, securing 10 million players in just three days and 20 million in two weeks. The free-to-play superhero team-based PvP shooter launched on December 6 across PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, and while Sony and Microsoft do not make player numbers public, Steam makes Valve stats available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, Marvel Rivals peaked over its launch weekend with 480,990 concurrent players, which was enough to put it in the top five most-played games on Valve's platform. It’s the 20th highest concurrent player number ever seen on Steam, ahead of the likes of Helldivers 2, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Destiny 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals launched with Season 0, with Season 1 set for January 9, according to the in-game battle pass countdown timer. It seems likely Fantastic Four will be made available with the release of Season 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review"><u>Marvel Rivals Review</u></a> to find out what we think.
