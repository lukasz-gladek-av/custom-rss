            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> developer Embark Studios released update 1.4.0 this week, and in the patch notes teased a “very hot fix for the locked room exploits.” It turns out they weren’t kidding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the release of the patch, players — as they often do — jumped into the hugely successful extraction shooter to give this fix a proper test. They’ve been able to cheat their way into locked rooms as before, but what they now find inside… well, Embark called it a “very hot fix” for a reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1p7ytbc/locked_rooms_now_turn_you_into_a_fireball_if_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forward_Problem_7550 discovered</a>, locked rooms now turn you into a fireball if you glitch inside. The clip below shows the trap in action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction to the change is positive, with most players getting a kick out of what Embark has done here. “Best part of this is the clowns doing the glitch lose all their stuff to someone who legitimately opens the door with a key. CLASSIC!” enthused A_Tortured_Crab. “It's genuinely a really good fix,” added vedomedo. “Hopefully this is the mindset they keep going forward. Punish the exploiters and reward legit players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, some players are saying they’re more inclined to use their keys to enter locked rooms legitimately in the hope of finding “some dingus who hasn't read the patch notes.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Technically this isn’t a fix, as players can still use the exploit to enter locked rooms. But it is an eye-catching workaround, and will surely put off players from trying to cheat their way inside a room after they’ve been cooked once.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Would’ve been better if they just didn’t say anything and rolled this out,” suggested Maverixk_. “Imagine all the door glitches finding this out and losing all of their s**t before word of mouth spread. Would’ve been hilarious.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not all the update did. It’s also patched the gun quick swap exploit. Full patch notes are below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arc Raiders Patch Notes 1.4.0:</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">Content and Bug Fixes</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Exploit mitigation mechanisms have been added for all locked rooms across all maps.</li><li>Fixed the gun exploit that allowed you to shoot quicker than intended by swapping to a quick use item and back.</li><li>The exterior access to Spaceport's Control Tower locked room has been blocked off.</li><li>Fixed the issue that sometimes caused low resolution textures in the Main Menu.</li><li>Fixed players being able to push each other by jumping on each other’s backs.</li><li>Fixed lighting artifacts that would sometimes occur upon entering maps.</li><li>Raider Voice now correctly respects the selected voice option after restarting the game.</li></ul><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">What if you exploit the doors now: 😂 <a href="https://t.co/JndqMjMpUn" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/JndqMjMpUn</a> <a href="https://t.co/81aFPE0ucD" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/81aFPE0ucD</a></p>— Scrappy (@TheRooster) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRooster/status/1993997509971292249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.

All cards involved are reprints of existing cards with Monster Hunter themes, nothing mechanically unique or new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say fans reacted negatively to the announcement, and based on <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/back-to-the-drawing-board-with-secret-lair-x-monster-hunter" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wizards of the Coast’s statement on the matter</a>, that backlash went right to the top.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Let's cut to the chase: the Secret Lair x Monster Hunter Superdrop we revealed last week fell short of expectations,” the company said. “We heard loud and clear that you were disappointed, and we believe we can do better. So, we're going to postpone this release and rework this Superdrop entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Like many of you, we're big fans of Monster Hunter. It's why we put this Superdrop together. But in our excitement, we missed the mark on elements like card selection and faithfully integrating the world and mechanics of Monster Hunter. As a result, the overall construction of this Superdrop is not up to the standard you have come to expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Pulling Superdrops back isn't something we're going to do very often, but we're committed to doing better. Capcom is on board for us to take another swing at this Superdrop as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, we're going to pull this one back and will share new details and an updated release date in a few months.

Well, I certainly think so. It's a great game! While IGN's reviewer and loot shooter aficionado, Travis Northup, felt the open world wasn’t quite as open as it could be, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-review"><u>he still gave the game a recommendable 8 out of 10</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Borderlands 4 gives the series the massive kick in the pants it has needed, with a fantastic open world and greatly improved combat, even if bugs and invisible walls can sometimes throw off that groove.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game also recently got a<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-patch-makes-big-balance-changes-with-all-vault-hunters-getting-buffs"><u> big balance patch,</u></a> which had very positive ramifications for my chosen Vault Hunter, Amon, and the PS5 version in this deal <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-gets-fov-slider-on-console-performance-improvements-and-vault-hunter-buffs-in-big-new-update"><u>now has an FOV slider and improved performance</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect Borderlands 4 to be around for a while, too. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/while-battling-performance-problems-on-pc-xbox-and-playstation-gearbox-delays-borderlands-4-on-nintendo-switch-2-just-a-week-before-launch-and-cancels-all-digital-pre-orders"><u>While the Switch 2 port has been delayed indefinitely</u></a>, the game’s <a href="https://in.ign.com/borderlands-4/240492/news/borderlands-4-gearbox-software-reveals-post-launch-roadmap-of-the-game-featuring-story-packs-vault-h" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>post-launch roadmap is stacked</u></a> - and will include a new Vault Hunter, C4SH, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/borderlands-4-official-c4sh-character-teaser"><u>who was revealed recently</u></a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Should You Wait for Black Friday on Nov. 28?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Wait? Not for a deal like this. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-sale-2025-early-deals">Black Friday</a> proper might throw a few curveballs on November 28, but <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWE0gN?object_uuid=f6b514ba-9d01-42f0-a0c3-3c4f9a957a66&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Borderlands 4 at $35</a> is already sitting firmly in Black Friday-deal territory, and it’s absolutely worth grabbing before the stock gets lost to the shadow realm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Only Amazon and GameStop have it right now, so if the price gets nuked, that’s you staring down a fresh dose of Black Friday FOMO. Hopefully Walmart and Best Buy wake up and match it soon. If it’s been sitting on your wishlist, this is the best price you’re going to see, and it wipes the floor with pretty much anything else in the mix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also goes head to head with what I’d been calling the best PS5 game deal so far, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater at $30. And if you’ve been lurking around my bargain roundups, you’ve already seen the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-best-games-under-20-dollars-2025">$20 or less list stuffed</a> with heavy hitters, plus the under <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-best-games-under-30-dollars-2025">$30 guide</a> where MGS was the star of the show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like BF6, those are going to disappear fast.
