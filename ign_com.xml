This particular model boasts a massive 25,000mAh battery capacity, 165W of total charging output, and two built-in USB Type-C cables in case you forget to bring your own. It's also attractively priced at under $100, and there's even a deal today that drops the price by another $10 to $89.99. This is a great complement to your power-hungry gaming handheld PC like the Steam Deck, Asus Rog Ally, or Lenovo Legion Go.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New Release: Anker 25,000mAh 165W Power Bank</h2><div catalogid="8479891f-e34a-4cd8-951d-5230aeb5aeed" id="215024"><div id="215024" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker 25,000mAh 165W Power Bank with Two Built-In USB Type-C Cables</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Anker power bank features a 25,000mAh battery capacity, which is the second largest capacity we've seen from Anker in a compact form factor. So how much juice will that offer to today's gaming handheld PCs? A 25,000mAh battery equates to a 95Whr capacity. An 80% power efficiency rating (which is standard for power banks) means you get about 76Whr of usable charge. That means this power bank will charge a Steam Deck or ROG Ally (40Whr) from empty to completely full <strong>2 times</strong>, an Asus ROG Ally X (80Whr) <strong>1 time</strong>, and a Nintendo Switch (16Whr) about <strong>4.75 times</strong>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Anker power bank has one USB Type-C port and one USB Type-A port. In addition, there are two built-in USB Type-C cables. One is a retractable cable that can extend up to 2.3 feet. The other is a fixed 1-foot cable that doubles up as a lanyard when not in use. Each USB Type-C port is capable of up to 100W of Power Delivery with a total 165W maximum output. That means all three USB outputs are capable of charging any gaming handheld PC at its fastest rate, including the Asus ROG Ally X, which supports up to 100W of fast charging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another feature common to Anker's other premium power banks is the digital LCD readout. It displays a wealth of information like remaining battery capacity, current charging rate, input/output wattage, battery temperature, battery health, charge cycle count, and more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TSA-Approved</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">TSA states that power banks must be under 100Whr in capacity for carry-on (check-in is not allowed under any circumstances). This Anker power bank is rated at 95Whr. You might get checked simply because this is a relatively hefty power bank, but you shouldn't have any problems getting it cleared.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">See more power banks we've recommended</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
