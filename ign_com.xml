"We knew exclusivity was the name of the game in a lot of fields, like Sky TV with sports. Just as Christmas was approaching when Xbox would launch, a few of us went out to our favourite third-party publishers and developers, and we asked them, 'How would you like a special deal if you keep your next-generation game on PlayStation exclusive for a two-year period?' And one of the deals we made was with Take-Two for the next three Grand Theft Auto games. At the time, it wasn't clear that Grand Theft Auto 3 was going to be as huge as it was, because it used to be a top-down game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was very lucky for us. And actually lucky for them, because they got a discount on the royalty they paid. Those deals aren't uncommon in industries with platforms. Including today with things like social media."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Grand Theft Auto Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result of this deal, Grand Theft Auto 3 released in October 2001 as a PS2 exclusive, a month before the original Xbox came out. The game released in May 2002 on PC, and then, two years after the PlayStation launch and after this exclusivity deal ended, in November 2003 for the Xbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Deering mentioned, Sony’s Grand Theft Auto exclusivity deal was for three games, so included Vice City, which came out in October 2002 for the PS2 first, and San Andreas, which released in October 2004 for the PS2 first. Grand Theft Auto 3 and Vice City hit Xbox together as a pack late 2003, with San Andreas launching in June 2005.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The deal worked out perfectly for both Sony and Rockstar parent company Take-Two, as Deering suggests. Indeed, San Andreas ended up the best-selling PS2 game of all time, Vice City the third best, and Grand Theft Auto 3 the fifth best. Only Gran Turismo came close the the sales the Grand Theft Auto games posted on PS2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The exclusivity deal also helped cement Grand Theft Auto as a PlayStation-first series, and while Grand Theft Auto 4 and Grand Theft Auto 5 launched on PlayStation and Xbox at the same time, Rockstar’s open-world crime epic is still strongly associated with Sony’s consoles, even now. In fact, a number of Grand Theft Auto games made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-100-best-playstation-games-of-all-time">IGN’s Top 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time list</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>? It’s due out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S at the same time in the fall of 2025, but marketing deals with either Sony or Microsoft have yet to be announced, if they exist at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-launches-to-huge-steam-concurrents<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals enjoyed an immediate huge launch, with over 440,000 concurrent players on Steam alone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase’s free-to-play Marvel-themed hero shooter saw a peak concurrent player count of 444,286 on Valve’s platform. But the true concurrent figure will be much higher given Marvel Rivals launched on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S also (Sony and Microsoft do not make player numbers public).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems to be going down well on Steam, too, with a ‘mostly positive’ user review rating from over 5,700 reviews (76% of the reviews are positive). Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review">Marvel Rivals Review in Progress</a> to find out what we think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For NetEase, it will be hoping not only to keep Marvel Rivals’ player count as high as possible for as long as possible (something that’s proved particularly tricky for live service games of late), but to make enough money from players to meet the company’s internal revenue projections. To that end, Marvel Rivals sells a battle pass and premium skins. But is it paying off? The game is currently third in Steam’s top-sellers list, which is sorted by revenue, behind only the pricey Steam Deck and Grinding Gear Games’ Path of Exile 2. This suggests Marvel Rivals is already convincing players to open their wallets.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/06/unnamed-11-1733478165414.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Marvel Rivals Twitch Drops Season 0. Image credit: NetEase Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals launched alongside Season 0, dubbed Dooms’ Rise. This month-long kick-off season starts with a total of 33 heroes, all available to play for free, eight maps for Quick Match and Competitive modes, a Conquest map, and a Practice Range. Dooms' Rise serves as the opening chapter “for the chaos caused by each of Doctor Dooms’ time experiments colliding and unleashing the Timestream Entanglement,” NetEase said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a Twitch Drops event for Season 0, as you’d expect from a live service game of this type, an 'Entangled Moments' seasonal event to unlock spray rewards, gallery card rewards, and stories for completing tasks, and a global launch gift: a special code for a free Iron Man costume.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
