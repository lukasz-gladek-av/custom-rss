            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> bundle is still live at Best Buy for $499.99, and it’s a smart pickup if you’re planning to get both anyway. You save $20 off the digital copy of the game, and with Switch 2 stock being all over the place, locking one in now isn’t a bad move.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokemon TCG</a> side, both the Black Bolt and White Flare Elite Trainer Boxes have dipped below Amazon pricing on TCGPlayer, now sitting at $91.50 and $90.98, respectively. That’s some of the best pricing we’ve seen outside of limited restocks, and probably your best shot at avoiding inflated third-party listings (although it's still way over MSRP).</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in today’s deals, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is $799.99 at Best Buy, which is $500 off its usual price and a great buy for an unlocked flagship. ROG Ally is also down to $499.99 with the Z1 Extreme chip and 512GB storage, which makes it one of the better portable gaming options if you want full Windows access. Soundcore P20i earbuds are just $19.98, the Anker 332 Power Strip is $15.99, and the upgraded 100W Anker Nano Charging Station is $35.99. All three are practical, everyday gear at their lowest prices in weeks.</p><p id="switch-2-pokmon-legends-z-a-bund"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A Bund">Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225666"><div id="225666" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Launching the same time as Pokémon Legends: Z-A, this bundle knocks a cool $20 off the digital price tag of the game (digital code included). We're not at the custom limited edition console point of the Switch 2's life cycle yet, but this is a smart way to secure the system and save some money whilst doing it. Just preorder quickly - I'm amazed Best Buy still has it live.</p></div><p id="pokmon-legends-z-a"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A">Pokémon Legends: Z-A (Switch 2)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225675"><div id="225675" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This $69.99 version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the Switch 1 game with the Switch 2 upgrade included. From what we've seen so far, we're talking 4K resolutions running at a buttery smooth 60 frames per second. Real-time battles, a fully explorable Lumiose City, and nighttime Z-A Royale events all benefit from the sharper visuals and faster load times. If you're already going in on a Switch 2, this is the version to get. It looks like the most technically ambitious Pokémon game yet, and Switch 2 seems to be the only way to experience it at its best.</p></div><p id="pokmon-legends-z-a"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A">Pokémon Legends: Z-A (Switch 1)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225676"><div id="225676" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not ready to upgrade to a Nintendo Switch 2 yet, the Switch 1 version still has an upgrade path so you have options down the line. Legends Z-A switches things up with real-time battles, an urban setting in Lumiose City, and the full return of Mega Evolutions, including 27 new forms like Mega Dragonite. The starter picks are a nice throwback, but what really caught my attention is the Z-A Royale system and Alpha Pokémon lurking across the city at night. Add in deep trainer customization and the Switch 2 upgrade option, and it’s clear the developers are trying to evolve more than just the Pokémon this time. If it plays as good as it sounds, this could be the next real shift for the series.</p></div><p id="black-bolt-elite-trainer-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box">Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225517"><div id="225517" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The fluxuations on this Elite Trainer Box has been crazy this week, but TCG Player finally has listings cheaper than Amazon starting at $91.50, around $20 cheaper than the big box giant. This is likely the cheapest you'll find it outside of a flash sale and pot luck restocks.</p></div><p id="pokemon-tcg-white-flare-elite-traine"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG White Flare Elite Traine">Pokemon TCG White Flare Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225580"><div id="225580" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG White Flare Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the same situation with the White Flare Elite Trainer Box, slightly cheaper than Black Bolt and around $13 worth of savings based on Amazon pricing. Again, it's a good time to buy.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">The Most Expensive Black Bolt White Flare Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're seeing some of the highest valued cards in the Scarlet and Violet era in Black Bolt White Flare.

It's above MSRP, but good luck finding a better price during Pokémania 2025.</p></div><p id="prismatic-evolutions-booster-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundle">Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225654"><div id="225654" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is currently $10 cheaper than TCG Player with Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundles, but it's still way over MSRP. Like all other sealed TCG products at the moment though, they're hard to find for shelf price.</p></div><p id="pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violetjourne"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journe">Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journey Together Booster Build &amp; Battle Box</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225584"><div id="225584" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Journey Together Build &amp; Battle Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only is Amazon over a dollar cheaper, you're saving on postage too compared to TCG Player.

Not only is the Black Bolt ETB vastly undercutting the secondary market, Paradox Rift ETB is even cheaper (and an overlooked set in my opinion, stock up now). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's other great deals on ex boxes too, which are also near MSRP and around the same or just under listings on TCG Player. The sealed market is becoming more competitive, so it's more important than ever to give eBay a quick check before hitting buy.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Nintendo Switch 2 Stock Updates</h2></p><div catalogid="e7c6732a-ef4d-47d3-8a5e-d382139346bf" id="225579"><div id="225579" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 - Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In a shocking move, Target is selling both Nintendo Switch 2 SKUs without preorders, waiting lists or raffles, so snap them up quickly. As predicted, Nintendo Switch 2's launch window is seeing stock shortages in the US. If you didn't preorder at launch, you've probably been waiting for stock drops since launch.</p></div><div catalogid="e7c6732a-ef4d-47d3-8a5e-d382139346bf" id="225578"><div id="225578" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon currently has its invitation system in place for both the standard console SKU and the Mario Kart world bundle, so it's always worth getting on the waiting list whilst you wait.

You’re getting a 200 megapixel camera, a sharp 6.8 inch OLED display, and enough power to handle anything. It works with nearly every carrier and still includes a built-in stylus, which is rare and actually useful.</p></div><p id="rog-ally-amd-ryzen-z1-extreme-512gb"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="ROG Ally AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme 512GB">ROG Ally AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme 512GB</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225763"><div id="225763" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>ROG Ally AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme 512GB</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At $499.99, this is the lowest I’ve seen the ROG Ally go with the Z1 Extreme chip and 512GB of storage. It runs Windows, so I can launch anything I already own on Steam or Game Pass without workarounds. The 120Hz screen is sharp and responsive, and I like that I can dock it or plug in a mouse and keyboard without needing extra gear.</p></div><p id="soundcore-wireless-earbuds"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Soundcore Wireless Earbuds">Soundcore Wireless Earbuds</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225764"><div id="225764" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Soundcore Wireless Earbuds</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At $19.98, these are about as cheap as I’ve seen for wireless earbuds that aren’t complete junk. You get 10 hours on single a charge, decent sound with actual bass, and the app gives you EQ control if you want to tweak things. Call quality is fine with two mics, and they’re small enough to carry around without thinking about it. For under twenty bucks, they do what they’re supposed to without falling apart.</p></div><p id="anker-332-usb-c-power-strip-surge-pr"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Anker 332 USB C Power Strip Surge Pr">Anker 332 USB C Power Strip Surge Protector</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225765"><div id="225765" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker 332 USB C Power Strip Surge Protector</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For $15.99, this is cheaper than most basic surge protectors and does way more. You get six outlets, USB-C charging with 20W power delivery, and a compact design that actually fits in tighter spots. It’s not going to blow you away, but it’s soound for a desk or nightstand setup, and the surge protection is better than the usual bargain bin stuff. At this price, I’d grab one just to stop moving my charger between rooms.</p></div><p id="anker-nano-charging-station"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Anker Nano Charging Station">Anker Nano Charging Station</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225766"><div id="225766" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker Nano Charging Station</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At $35.99, this is one of the few charging stations that can handle a laptop and still have room for everything else. Two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and three AC outlets is more than enough for a desk setup, and the 100W output means it actually charges a MacBook Pro properly. It keeps cables out of the way and cuts down on the need for multiple bricks. It’s compact, works well, and replaces at least two chargers and a power strip in one go.</p></div><p id="portable-neck-fan-with-led-display"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Portable Neck Fan With LED Display">Portable Neck Fan With LED Display</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225669"><div id="225669" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Portable Neck Fan With LED Display</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At $17.99, this neck fan is cheaper than a cumbersome handheld fan and way more useful. It's lightweight, quiet, and actually hands-free, which makes it easy to wear while working, traveling, or just trying to survive another summer heatwave. The LED display is a nice bonus since you don’t have to guess how much battery life is left, and the bladeless design means no hair tangles. Five speed settings and up to 15 hours of runtime for under twenty bucks? That’s a win.</p></div><p id="fourth-wing-wing-and-claw-collectio"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fourth Wing (Wing and Claw Collectio">Fourth Wing (Wing and Claw Collection) (The Empyrean, 1)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225670"><div id="225670" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fourth Wing (Wing and Claw Collection) (The Empyrean, 1)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're collecting The Empyrean series, this new edition of Fourth Wing is worth a look. It’s down to $23.09 right now, and the updated hardcover comes with stenciled edges to match Iron Flame and Onyx Storm, which should appeal to anyone trying to keep their shelf setup clean and consistent. This is a limited first print run for the U.S. and Canada, so it’s a good chance to own a unique version of your future favorite book series for a steal. </p></div><p id="iron-flame-standard-edition-the"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Iron Flame (Standard Edition) (The "> Iron Flame (Standard Edition) (The Empyrean, 2)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225672"><div id="225672" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Iron Flame (Standard Edition) (The Empyrean, 2)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're already deep into Fourth Wing, grabbing Iron Flame for $13.92 is a no-brainer, especially with the list price pushing $30. The narration from Rebecca Soler adds a solid layer to the story, and this sequel dives straight into the brutality and politics of Basgiath without slowing down. Things are darker, the stakes are higher, and Violet’s got even more to lose. It’s long, intense, and exactly what fans of the first book are probably hoping for.</p></div><p id="anker-laptop-power-bank-25000mah"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Anker Laptop Power Bank, 25,000mAh">Anker Laptop Power Bank, 25,000mAh</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225671"><div id="225671" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker Laptop Power Bank, 25,000mAh</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The 25,000mAh capacity on this bad boy is enough to charge a laptop and a few other devices on the go, with the triple 100W USB-C ports make it way more versatile than your average power bank.

You’re getting all three Dark Knight films in 4K with HDR, plus Blu-rays and digital copies, all packed in exclusive Steelbook cases that are made for collectors. Nolan’s trilogy still holds up as some of the best superhero filmmaking, and if you're going to own it this is the version to get.</p></div><p id="funko-pop-plus-the-lord-of-the-rin"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Funko Pop!

It’s the glow-in-the-dark version, and Funkos usually hold up well over time on a shelf or desk (especially boxed). For the price, it’s a low-effort way to round out a collection or grab a gift that doesn’t feel like a cop out.</p></div><p id="bookoo-jump-starter-2000a"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="BOOKOO Jump Starter 2000A">BOOKOO Jump Starter 2000A</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225677"><div id="225677" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>BOOKOO Jump Starter 2000A</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>For Car/Boat/Lawnmower(8.0L Gas/6.5L Diesel Engine) </p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For under $35, this jump starter is a solid backup to keep in the car, especially with how often batteries can die without warning.

The new line of KRK Kreate studio monitors aren't just for recording music (Although they'd do an amazing job), they're a versatile sound option for content creation, editing, gaming, watching TV and movies and more. Buyers can even teather to them via Bluetooth for no fuss connections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been using the 8-inch speaker models for a couple of weeks now, and they destroy my soundbar and subwoofer combo that costs nearly double the price. There's precision adjustments knobs on the back, which I keep mostly in neutral with volume up by half for a crisp flat sound with the right amount of bass. Although that can be cranked up when needed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I use an audio splitter so my Krate 8s can handle my Nano QuadCortex guitar amp moddler, my TV audio and gaming PC audio for the best experience. For me, going from a 3-inch to 8-inch speaker option is night and day. The clarity difference and range is top-tier, not to mention the jack, XLR and aux outputs available on each monitor that fits in perfectly in everyone's setup. You're getting top-of-the-range brand quality without the "gaming" brand tax, it's a win-win.</p><p id="apple-airpods-pro-2"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods Pro 2">Apple AirPods Pro 2</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225530"><div id="225530" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">AirPods Pro 2 are one of those earbuds I appreciate for their mix of sound quality and thoughtful features.

You get four sizes of silicone tips for a customizable fit, and once those are set they stay comfortable even through longer listening sessions.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here come the Fares followers, and this one could be mighty special.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Josef Fares-directed co-op games from Hazelight have been so good – and crucially, also so commercially successful – that it’s about time we started seeing some other developers trying to get in on that artistically beautiful, mandatory two-player action. And Out of Words, from poet Morten Søndergaard and co-developers WiredFly and Kong Orange, not only fits the mold cast by Fares, but has the potential to be as good as anything the former filmmaker has made so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s purely coincidental that Out of Words has so much in common with Hazelight’s games, but it’s an interesting coincidence nonetheless. Søndergaard, like Fares, is a European artist who came from outside of the games industry. And Out of Words promises an emotional two-player coming-of-age physics-based puzzle platforming journey for its pair of handcrafted protagonists, Kurt and Karla. Those parallels aside, though, Out of Words very clearly looks set to stand tall on its own two feet. First of all, it’s absolutely gorgeous, and completely handmade. Literally. Each character and set piece was made in real life and painstakingly animated frame by frame. In motion it looks – and sounds – absolutely gorgeous. I got to play it for a quick 20 minutes, but if the entire game is anything like my brief hands-on, then this could be up there with anything Hazelight has made so far.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Søndergaard jumped me around to a few different parts of the story, but I got to see a bit of the beginning, when Kurt and Karla find themselves transported to Vokabulantis just as they are each trying to find the words to say that they have feelings for each other. They awaken to find that they have no mouths – kinda like that part in The Matrix, but less disturbing – and must find new ways to communicate. This translates in game terms to co-op puzzles, usually physics-based. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>They awaken to find that they have no mouths – kinda like that part in The Matrix, but less disturbing.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, in one section I played, whichever one of you held Aleph, a pet creature that is a literal symbol of your friendship, would have their gravity reversed and float up to the ceiling, while the other stayed on the ground. Navigating through various vertically oriented sections required careful timing of both jumping and tossing Aleph to the other person, lest one of you fall into the abyss. In another area, Kurt and Karla came to an area under Vokabulantis, where books are stacked everywhere and the doubt about their feelings for each other is represented by literal darkness. And in yet another spot, you both become a ball of primordial clay with each of you controlling an arm that can jut out from the body of the clay ball to grab onto the environment. You must work together to successfully work your way through all of the obstacles in your path. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Out of Words - SGF 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I mentioned music earlier for good reason. During a serene early moment, as the two of you run across a puddle-strewn grassy field, a subtle-but-powerful musical note hits every time either of you jumps and lands back on the ground. Hopefully there are more moments like that throughout Out of Words’s run, as it added a poignant punch to what promises to be a very emotional game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, if all of this sounds…<em>weird</em>, I get it. It’s definitely weird. But when you and a friend sit down to play it, via cross-play online co-op or together on a couch in same-screen, it’ll all start to make sense. I can’t say I’ve played a game quite like Out of Words. Sure, it has a lot in common with Hazelight’s body of work, but it’s also very much its own unique expression of art and story. The art I can already definitively vouch for, and the story? Well, let’s see what kind of metaphors, morals, and moments the poet Søndergaard can deliver when Out of Words ships for PC (via Epic Games Store), PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026. I can’t wait.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.
