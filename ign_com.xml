            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake"><u>Silent Hill 2 Remake</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn"><u>Cronos: The New Dawn</u></a> developer Bloober Team is working on a number of new projects, including a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2"><u>Nintendo Switch 2</u></a> version of its disorientating horror <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/layers-of-fear-2023"><u>Layers of Fear</u></a>, Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition, and a number of smaller games from its subsidiary, Broken Mirror Games, which include a mysterious Switch exclusive, codenamed Project M.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don't quite know exactly when The Masterpiece Edition will land — it's still labelled as coming in 2025 despite the fact we're running down the clock of what's left of the year — but as reported in the firm's <a href="https://ir.blooberteam.com/2025/10/09/bloober-team-ujawnia-aktualny-kalendarz-wydawniczy-swoich-projektow/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent investor briefing</a>, it's described as a "complete edition," presumably bundling the base game with subsequent content and the refreshed visuals we saw in 2023's Layers of Fears. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Broken Mirror's offering? Here, we can expect isometric horror <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/i-hate-this-place"><u>I Hate This Place</u></a> based on the 80s comic of the same name that's still listed as releasing next month, but has been delayed to January 29, 2026. But there are also two codenamed games in development, too: Project M and Project F.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We know next to nothing about Project F, but Project M is thought to release next year. While the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIYTTFIZS0c" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>live-action teaser we saw earlier this year</u></a> gives away very little — other than the M could stand for "Marionette", perhaps?! — Bloober confirms it will be available exclusively on both Switch 2 and the OG console.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And of course, after the phenomenal success of Silent Hill 2 Remake, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-remake"><u>Bloober is also remaking the first game in the franchise</u></a>. There's not much to go on, unfortunately, but we did get <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-1-remake-officially-in-development-at-bloober-team-konami-has-announced">a brief tease during June's Konami Press Start Live showcase</a> that included the Silent Hill logo and its iconic music. No release date was mentioned, unfortunately, but it followed news in February that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-developer-bloober-signs-deal-for-another-game-for-konami-could-it-be-more-silent-hill"><u>Bloober Team had signed a deal with Konami</u></a> to make a new game based on the Japanese company’s IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/layers-of-fear-2023-review"><u>We thought 2023's Layers of Fear remake was 'Okay,' awarding it 6/10</u></a>, writing: "Layers of Fear is an atmospheric tour through the shattered psyches of some seriously tortured artists, but predictable shock tactics fail to provide more than a handful of genuine scares, let alone layers of them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

There’s always a chance we’ll get fresh printings since the Final Fantasy set will be standard legal for a while, but the option is there if you’re particularly keen to lock down the cards and have cash to burn. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to want for restocks to buy at MSRP, I respect that as well. I recommend following the <a href="https://x.com/IGNDeals" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGNDeals team on Twitter/X</a>, and they will be sure to update you whenever there are stock updates in the coming months.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Limit Break Game Edition Commander Deck</h2><div catalogid="73100320-bb0a-4140-b302-a29270875eda" id="229401"><div id="229401" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Limit Break Commander Deck - Game Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">First up, a new version of the Limit Break Commander Deck offers the same 100-card deck you can find already, but with a download code for the original Final Fantasy 7 on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aeKpP5?object_uuid=9e7f1239-d981-4da7-9504-b3463d2b2aaf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Is that worth paying upwards of $180 for</a>?

From the outside, it looks like a standard booster bundle, but it’s a little different because it includes some Chocobo foil lands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Inside, you’ll find ten Play Boosters from the Final Fantasy set, a Chocobo click wheel (it’s green and yellow, it seems), 32 Final Fantasy landmark lands (16 foil, 16 non-foil), a Universes Beyond promo card of Birds of Paradise as Paradise Chocobo and two borderless Chocobo track cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve just written the word ‘Chocobo’ so many times it’s fried my brain a tad, but here’s one more - the Chocobo bundle includes an extra non-foil card that you can also find in the Scene Boxes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bundle is currently sitting at around $365 market value on TCGPlayer, but expect it to drop. <strong>Note: Be aware that this is $255 more than the list price of $109.99 at Amazon, and an 232% markup.</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2">Final Fantasy Scene Boxes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While I appreciate they aren’t for everyone, I love the idea of Scene Boxes, having picked up Lord of the Rings and Spider-Man ones so far. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a great way to show off some of the awesome Magic artwork, you get six art cards that slot into a cardboard frame, as well as versions with the text on to actually, you know, play Magic with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This time around, Wizards is doing four Scene Boxes, with each based on a different Final Fantasy game, while avoiding doubling up on any games that got a Commander Deck. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You're looking at around $100-$110 for one of these at a trusted resale site like TCGPlayer, 138% markup and around $60-70 more than the $41.99 list price.
