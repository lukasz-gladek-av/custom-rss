Dave the Diver was originally only available on PC at its 2023 launch, followed by a Nintendo Switch version in 2024 and PlayStation releases in 2024. A Nintendo Switch 2 dedicated version just released earlier this month.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dave the Diver follows Dave, who by day dives into the Blue Hole to catch fish with his harpoon gun in a survival adventure setting, and by night runs a sushi restaurant where he serves up his catching to hungry diners in a management sim. The game received wide acclaim at launch: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dave-the-diver-review">we gave it a 9/10</a>, saying it's "wholesome, wonderfully complex, and delightfully hard to put down."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the trailer, we also got a brief tease of some upcoming previously-announced DLC, called In the Jungle, which will feature the addition of freshwater fish and some amount of new story. This DLC was previously announced at The Game Awards last year for a late 2025 launch, but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-delays-in-the-jungle-dlc-but-sure-knows-how-to-soften-the-blow-with-these-other-announcements" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later delayed to 2026</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's Xbox Partner Showcase opened with a brand new game reveal I certainly didn't see coming: it's called Armatus, and it's seemingly being made by the developers of Godfall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Armatus is a new third-person roguelite shooter set in a fictionalized version of Paris that's looking...pretty messed up. An event called The Vanishing has effectively caused the end of the world, and you're some sort of masked warrior roaming around and fighting demons. That's really all we know for now: the trailer gave us a look at a lot of combat and some pretty cool monster designs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/armatus-xbox-partner-preview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire post</a>, we learned a little more: after the end of the world, four members of something called the Armatus meet and summon the player to fight on their behalf and get them sent to heaven. You're searching for something called The Sunless Gate along The Scoured Path, which is a constantly changing road through a broken Paris, with procedurally-spawned rooms, enemy compositions, and rewards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've forgotten everything about Counterplay's last game, Godfall, here's a refresh: Godfall was an action RPG that came out in 2020, initially just for PlayStation and PC but later for Xbox as well. It was described at the time as a "looter-slasher", heavily focused on finding and collecting better and better gear, and that admittedly had an awful lot of cool-looking weapons to collect. Unfortunately it received pretty mixed reviews, including from us, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/godfall-review">getting an IGN 6/10</a>. As our reviewer put it then: "Godfall can be an enjoyable and lovely gear-based action game while it lasts, but the repetition of its missions wears thin before the end of its campaign, and even thinner in the endgame afterward." Hopefully Armatus fairs better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Armatus is coming out in 2026 for Xbox Series consoles, PS5, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2.

These arrive alongside visual polish and stability updates for a “smoother” experience on Kairos, Gearbox said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Digging into the detail, Class Mods have been adjusted to drop more for your current character, which is a welcome change for those on the hunt for ever-improving builds. The loot feed is now updated to display total current currency after spending or receiving money, and the likelihood of unintended movements or knockbacks while reviving a teammate is reduced. And it's worth noting that the patch adds a new Legendary Loot Indicator to the combat radar for easier identification of high-rarity drops. given how busy with loot Borderlands 4 can get, this is also welcome.</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In the <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes</a>, below, Gearbox said it was wrapping up work on Photo Mode, while other updates like support for multiple active Big Encore Machines and more options for scaling difficulty are coming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Further into the future, Gearbox said it’s looking at ways to improve shared character progression, add additional endgame-focused activities (Takedown), launch cross-save support, and more.

This being a holiday-themed Bounty Pack, we knew we had to deliver it to you by the end of the year. However, the team realized that there was more mayhem than time when it came to getting as much into Bounty Pack 1 as originally planned while never slowing down in their mission to improve the <em>Borderlands 4</em> player experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So in the spirit of the season, we're giving a gift to all <em>Borderlands 4</em> players by making Bounty Pack 1 free! Thank you for all the passion and support you've given us as a community. We're hard at work making sure future Bounty Packs are more fully loaded with the compelling content players have been asking for.
