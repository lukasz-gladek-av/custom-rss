Players will "ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythic continent."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some had wondered what was happening with Highguard given developer Wildlight Entertainment failed to follow up its The Game Awards reveal with any new trailers or even more detailed information about how it works. It’s fair to say that some felt Highguard did not warrant the coveted big finish slot at The Game Awards — the biggest video game reveal show in the world — and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/can-we-stop-dunking-on-highguard-before-its-even-out-please">it has suffered from a degree of negativity online since</a>. With the likes of Sony's disastrous live-service PvP shooter Concord still fresh in the memory, some have even declared Highguard "dead on arrival."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb on the launch showcase:</p><blockquote>Tune in on Monday, January 26 at 10am PT for an in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">It looks like Wildlight is trying to replicate the hugely successful launch of Apex Legends, which publisher EA released in 2019 with little pre-release marketing but heavy involvement from streamers on its actual release date. Highguard is set to launch across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 library is growing this year, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aA8MpL?object_uuid=72bd9bc9-9d5d-4d0a-a341-e18d21ab0bb9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Super Mario Bros. Wonder Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> is joining the party soon. This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-edition-release-date-plus-elephant-mario-and-captain-toad-amiibo">upgraded version of the 2023 Switch game</a> includes some fresh enhancements alongside a new expansion called "Meetup in Bellabel Park" and some new characters joining the fun. It's quite the upgrade, and it's still a couple of months away (mark your calendars for March 26), but preorders are already live at select retailers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to other Switch 2 Editions that have released, there's a digital upgrade pack for those who already have the original Switch version, alongside a standard, complete version of the game's Switch 2 version for those who don't currently own the original. We've included where you can preorder a full physical copy of the game (<a href="https://zdcs.link/aA8MpL?object_uuid=72bd9bc9-9d5d-4d0a-a341-e18d21ab0bb9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">for $79.99</a>) and this upgrade pack (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QrJeGD?object_uuid=72bd9bc9-9d5d-4d0a-a341-e18d21ab0bb9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">for $19.99</a>) below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder Super Mario Bros.

As for the digital version, that hasn't gone up for preorder yet, for some reason. We'll be sure to update it once it's available, though.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder Super Mario Bros.

Wonder on Nintendo Switch and are just hoping to get the upgrade pack to use it on your Switch 2, that's currently available to preorder right now at the Nintendo eShop. For $19.99, this will set you up with all of the extras from the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition when the game is released on March 26.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save on Super Mario Bros.

At the moment, Woot is offering the original version of Super Mario Bros. Wonder for $46.99. If you don't already own it, you can buy from Woot at this good price and then purchase the upgrade pack, which brings your total cost to $66.98. Compared to the $79.99 price tag for the physical Switch 2 Edition, this is a great little deal to take advantage of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div><h3 data-cy="title3"><svg data-cy="icon-logo" viewBox="0 0 76 24" title="IGN"><title>IGN Logo</title><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M5.38 7.65a7.85 7.85 0 0 1 2.26-2.26c.13-1.18.31-2.26.52-3.21a10.605 10.605 0 0 0-6 6c.95-.22 2.03-.39 3.21-.52M16.34 5.36v.02c.9.59 1.67 1.37 2.27 2.27 1.18.13 2.26.31 3.21.52a10.627 10.627 0 0 0-6.02-6.01c.22.95.4 2.02.54 3.2M7.64 18.62c-.9-.59-1.67-1.37-2.27-2.27h-.03c-1.19-.14-2.26-.32-3.19-.54 1.07 2.75 3.26 4.95 6.01 6.02-.22-.95-.39-2.03-.52-3.21M18.64 16.35h-.03c-.59.9-1.37 1.67-2.27 2.27v.03c-.14 1.17-.32 2.25-.54 3.19a10.59 10.59 0 0 0 6.03-6.03c-.94.22-2 .4-3.19.54M10.04 0h3.9c.85 1.85 1.2 4.59 1.3 5.52.04.22.06.43.06.63L12 9.11 8.7 6.15c0-.17.02-.35.05-.55.1-.95.43-3.75 1.29-5.61M8.7 17.83c0 .17.02.35.05.55.1.95.43 3.75 1.29 5.61h3.9c.85-1.84 1.2-4.59 1.3-5.52.04-.22.06-.43.06-.64L12 14.87l-3.3 2.96ZM6.16 8.68c-.17 0-.35.02-.55.05-.95.12-3.75.45-5.61 1.31v3.9c1.84.85 4.59 1.19 5.52 1.3.22.04.43.06.64.06L9.11 12 6.16 8.7ZM24 10.02c-1.86-.86-4.66-1.19-5.61-1.29-.2-.03-.38-.05-.55-.05l-2.96 3.3 2.96 3.3c.2 0 .41-.02.64-.06.93-.11 3.68-.45 5.52-1.3v-3.9Z"></path><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M42.83 13.9V10h10.45c1.06 0 1.93.86 1.93 1.92v4.63c0 2.38-1.91 4.36-4.33 4.36h-6.69c-4.96 0-8.97-4-8.97-8.94s4.04-8.95 8.98-8.95h10.36v4.11H44.2c-2.67 0-4.86 2.17-4.86 4.84s2.16 4.83 4.86 4.83h6.91v-2.91h-8.27ZM33.86 3h-4.07v16.02c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.15V3M74.37 3.01h-2.18v13.81s0 .08-.03.11a.29.29 0 0 1-.24.14c-.09 0-.16-.04-.25-.15L64.83 4.93a4.347 4.347 0 0 0-3.72-2.11h-.07c-2.39 0-4.32 1.93-4.32 4.32v11.88c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.17V7.14s.02-.09.04-.13a.29.29 0 0 1 .24-.14c.09 0 .18.03.24.14l6.88 12.07c.76 1.27 2.12 2.05 3.69 2.05h.07c2.39 0 4.32-1.93 4.32-4.32V4.92c0-1.05-.85-1.91-1.91-1.91"></path></svg>Recommends</h3></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition]]></content:encoded>

It’s a 3/4 with flying, but arrives with a -1/-1 counter, which can be removed as an activated ability that also counters a noncreature spell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a lot to remember, but if you find <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj8wZp?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Glen Elendra Guardian in Showcase art</u></a>, you could earn around $34, or up to $47 in foil.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">9 - Bitterbloom Bearer (Showcase) - From $42</h3></div><div id="234632"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234632" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bitterbloom Bearer (Showcase)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wBZYb?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Bitterbloom Bearer is another Showcase card</u></a>, and it’s sitting at $42 but can reach as high as $85 in foil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a two-cost Faerie Rogue, again with Flying and Flash, but saps life on your upkeep to create Faerie creature tokens with flying.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">8 - Selfless Safewright (Showcase) - From $45.03</h3></div><div id="234633"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234633" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Selfless Safewright (Showcase) </h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one is already dropping in price, but the <a href="https://zdcs.link/a56025?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Showcase version of Selfless Safewright</u></a> is now $45.03 in foil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a 4/2, five-cost Elf Warrior creature with (you guessed it) Flash.
