Sweet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has become increasingly strict when it comes to sharing information found in the credits of its video games ahead of time — to the extent that it frequently refuses to acknowledge the developer of its games before their release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In similar news, we recently learned that Takashi Nagasako, who previously voiced Donkey Kong for 21 years, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-credits-confirm-dks-new-voice-actor-and-theres-a-fresh-voice-for-pauline-too"><u>was no longer credited for the character as of Mario Kart World, either</u></a>. Kouji Takeda is instead credited as Donkey Kong in all of the game's various language options, including Bananza. Takeda previously voiced Donkey Kong in the Japanese dub of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-bros-movie"><u>Super Mario Bros. Movie</u></a> and now appears to have taken over as the video game voice of Donkey Kong as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The changes in Nintendo's hitherto consistent voice casting come after the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-charles-martinet-is-not-involved-in-super-mario-bros-wonder"><u>retirement of Charles Martinet as the voice of Mario, Luigi, Wario, and Waluigi</u></a> after almost 30 years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
