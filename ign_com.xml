Pokémon TCG Pocket is free to play but allows players to buy extra booster packs, cosmetics, and a monthly pass that awards one extra pack a day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The app launched to immediate success, with AppMagic estimating <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">it was making $3 million a day after hitting $12 million after four</a>.
