It’s also causing some big changes to card value as players rush to upgrade its precons, particularly the Blight Curse one. Thanks to our friends at <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/article/The-Biggest-Price-Spikes-in-Magic-The-Gathering-This-Week-01-24-2026/94235908-d3d2-4a36-931c-f99edfc5e342/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TCGplayer</u></a>, we’ve got a rundown of the movers and shakers kicking off the latest set.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Climbers</h2><div id="234772"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234772" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Multiversal Passage</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll get to the Blight Curse deck in a moment, but this Spider-Man Land is seeing some play since it works with the Dance of the Elements precon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpBPVo?object_uuid=4fdfecca-5da9-4b20-8296-92b4c728ffb6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Multiversal Passage</u></a> enters, it can become any basic land you need it to be, entering tapped or being ready to go at the cost of two life. It’s wobbling at around $10 right now, but was half that just weeks ago.</p></div><div id="234773"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234773" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nest of Scarabs</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">OK, it’s Auntie Ool’s time to shine. The Commander behind Blight Curse deck is all about putting -1/-1 counters on cards, and that makes <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxew0D?object_uuid=4fdfecca-5da9-4b20-8296-92b4c728ffb6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Nest of Scarabs</u></a> a great pick since it turns those counters into 1/1 insect creature tokens, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s reached almost $10 seemingly overnight, and is a nice, obvious inclusion for the precon upgrade package.</p></div><div id="234774"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234774" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Generous Patron</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QG8yxM?object_uuid=4fdfecca-5da9-4b20-8296-92b4c728ffb6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Generous Patron</u></a> is anything but obvious, though. It puts +1/+1 counters on creatures, which at first glance feels like the opposite of what Auntie Ool’s deck will have you doing. Still, the text below reads “Whenever you put one or more counters on a creature you don't control, draw a card.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since that part doesn’t specify which counters trigger card draw, enjoy drawing more cards! It’s reached $12, again almost overnight.</p></div><div id="234776"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234776" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pandemonium</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a href="https://zdcs.link/922vvL?object_uuid=4fdfecca-5da9-4b20-8296-92b4c728ffb6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Pandemonium</u></a> has spiked to around $14.
