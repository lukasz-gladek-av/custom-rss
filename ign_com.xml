            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ballerina-team-not-setting-out-to-do-a-female-john-wick<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When From the World of John Wick: Ballerina hits theaters in June, it will mark the first film entry in the ever-expanding franchise not led by Keanu Reeves’s titular assassin. Instead Reeves passes the baton (or should we say Glock) to Ana de Armas and her character Eve Macarro, who the team insists is complex and nuanced in her own right and not just a female John Wick clone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">De Armas leads a cast of newcomers featuring Norman Reedus and Gabriel Byrne along with returning faces Reeves, Ian McShane, Anjelica Houston, and the late Lance Reddick.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ccxp-2024-everything-announced"><u>a wild panel at CCXP</u></a> last week in São Paulo, Brazil, much of the cast along with director Len Wiseman sat down with IGN to talk about building on the franchise’s mythology, if de Armas could take Reeves in a fight, and how they made a John Wick movie without John Wick himself as the lead.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">From the World of John Wick: Ballerina</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> At the CCXP panel, the fans were really excited to see you all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ian McShane (Winston Scott): </strong> Delicious. It was delicious.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> With all that energy, what do you think is going to surprise and excite them about Ballerina?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ana de Armas (Even Macarro):</strong> It’s (a) new take on this world. It is changing perspectives and a new point of view in the world that we already know and love. But this time (it’s) through Eve's experience. We’ll see the connection and the timeline, how it intertwines with John Wick.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Len Wiseman (Director):</strong> One of the things that was very important early on was that I was not setting out to do a female John Wick, that John Wick is John Wick. This is an entirely different character, kick-ass (in) her own right. (She’s) a new character within the world, not somebody that's replicating what John Wick does. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> John Wick shows up in some form in Ballerina… </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Norman Reedus (Daniel Pine):</strong> He shows up in human form. In human form. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I was not setting out to do a female John Wick. This is a completely different character. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wiseman: </strong>Eve is looking to become an assassin. (She) starts up with the Ruska Roma, train(s), and becomes an assassin. John Wick is really essentially trying to get out of the world. So that became the building ground of what really set it apart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>McShane:</strong> It’s new but natural. I mean, don't forget, we've met the character before as a girl, but now we meet her as a grown-up. So my character has been keeping tabs on her throughout all these years. So when she appears, (he tries to) dissuade her from a mission in a certain sense as he always does John. Winston's ever, ever enigmatic. And also it's a natural thing. It's nice to turn around instead of looking at Keanu, I look at this gorgeous…</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>De Armas</strong>: Keanu's gorgeous,</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>McShane:</strong> Oh, he's gorgeous too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>De Armas:</strong> Keanu is gorgeous too. We love him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Norman, was there something specific that made you want to join this franchise?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Reedus:</strong> Well, I'm a big fan already. I've worked with Len before. I am friends with Keanu. I'm a big fan of Ana's as well, and the whole franchise. I mean, it's a cool world to be a part of, so it was kind of a no-brainer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Ana, you're no stranger to fight scenes. Can you compare what you've done in Ballerina with what you did with Paloma In No Time To Die? Was there a change in how you approached the action scenes?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>De Armas:</strong> It’s a completely different character. I mean, I loved Paloma. I really wish I had more time in the movie and…</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>McShane: </strong>No, it was perfect. Everybody wanted her to come back again and she never did. But now you come back as a fully fledged “Paloma Two!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>De Armas: </strong>(With) Eve, her motivation behind it all, it's pain. In this case also, I had the time to sink my teeth into the fights and really had time to get better at it. Not just three weeks training. I was training for four or five months. So it was really intense and the stakes (of) the fights and the level of detail and everything. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are very intricate, complicated fights with very imaginative stuff that I have around me to figure out how to defend myself in this male-dominated world. So it's less humor, but also (in) the John Wick universe (there’s) this kind of humor or irony in these scenes. And some things are so crazy that you have to laugh at it because it's bananas. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Every time you check into a hotel, you're on an airplane, John Wick is playing.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>As the series has progressed, the mythology has gotten bigger and more complex. When you're making this movie, how do you balance that with the action scenes the John Wick films have become known for?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wiseman: </strong>One of the things that is very special about the franchise is the mythology and the worldbuilding. There’d be a lot of conversations (with Chad Stahelski, director of the four John Wick movies, and Keanu) about that. We’d say “what if we developed this section that's new to the world?” And so it is a balance. It's fun. I love worldbuilding. So it's challenging, but it's a lot of fun as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>McShane:</strong> The mythology behind it has always been steeped into some kind of movie reality. That's why people love them. Lights go down (for) two hours, you go somewhere else, then the lights go up and you should feel you've been somewhere (else), a little deeper each time. Fans get so obsessed by and now social media, they want to know an answer to everything that happens in a movie. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>De Armas: </strong>When we met John Wick, he's already who he is, and we didn't see him becoming that person. We didn't see him in the Ruska Roma. And how was that training and preparation? And we do see that through Eve. What does it mean to be protected by them or be an outsider? What are the consequences? If you break the rules, who can help you? Who can you trust? So for me, it was interesting to explore a little bit more of the origins of becoming an assassin. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>McShane: </strong>I know (writers) Chad (Stahelski) and Michael (Finch) and Shay (Batten), each time kill off every character apart from Keanu. There are many versions until they decide how it should be going forward. The one thing I'll miss if we do another one is my dear friend Lance Reddick, of course. God bless you brother. But this will be a fitting testament to his character. And he was a great human being. He was a lovely man. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Norman, you've been involved in projects before that have had really hardcore dedicated fan bases. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Reedus: </strong>I think the first time I experienced a rabid fan base was Boondock Saints. That movie, for not coming to theaters, was the most rented Blockbuster DVD ever above Titanic. And we filmed that for like $7 million. It became that successful because of the fan base. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">(With) The Walking Dead, that fan base is crazy. Death Stranding even has a crazy fan base. Of course, (John Wick) has a crazy fan base. Every time you check into a hotel, you're on an airplane, John Wick is playing. I'm sure this will be the same. So bring on the crazy. It's great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>When you're preparing for a role like this in Ballerina, do you approach it differently than your involvement in something like Death Stranding?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Reedus:</strong> That's apples and oranges. (Ballerina) is very physical and very mathematically put together as far as action scenes go. There's a lot of people that help put those types of things together and make them safe and make them spectacular. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">(The) people on a Death Stranding game are behind a computer and the walls are blue and I have a skintight, Lycra body suit on with a camera and balls all over me. And Hideo is going "pick up that baby doll and cry." And I'm like, “why?” And he's like, “look, a whale goes over.” They're totally different. There's nothing to hold onto in a Death Stranding game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Keanu is God. He's the Baba Yaga.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Ana has trained so much for this, as Keanu did for all of his movies. Could you pick between Ana and Keanu if they faced off against each other? Who would win?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wiseman: </strong>John Wick. John Wick is the Baba Yaga. He has been Eve's character. She's on the rise. She starts to train, so we'll check it in a couple years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Reedus: </strong>There’s John Wick, then there's Keanu. If those crossed, maybe she would win because John would be "I can't. You can have it." You know what I mean?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Ana, with all of the training you've done, do you think you could take Keanu if it came to it in a fight?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>De Armas:</strong> No, he's God. Keanu is God. He's the Baba Yaga.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This piece was combined from two separate interviews and has been edited for clarity.  </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/2024-was-a-slow-year-for-our-fastest-genre<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Around this time last year I criticised The Game Awards for continually <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-best-sports-racing-category-is-an-insult-to-both-genres"><u>forcing racing games to share a common category with sports games</u></a>, to compete for recognition at what’s described (by The Game Awards) as “gaming’s biggest night.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Up until this year it was an award no traditional sports game had ever actually won. The category had been totally dominated by racing games, with the exception of 2015 (Rocket League, which still has cars in it) and 2020 (Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2, which is still… on wheels). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year FC 25 got the gong. Just a single racing game made the shortlist: F1 24. A great racing game, no doubt, but one that’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-24-review"><u>hard to argue was an immediately essential upgrade</u></a> for those who already owned F1 23, or F1 22, or so on. What else could’ve made it? Monster Jam Showdown? Good fun (which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-jam-showdown-review"><u>shouldn’t be surprising</u></a> given the developer’s recent form with the Hot Wheels Unleashed series) but I wouldn’t fancy its chances at The Game Awards. Le Mans Ultimate? Well, that’s still ostensibly in Steam Early Access, even though they’re… already selling in-game DLC before the game’s officially “finished.” Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review"><u>No chance.</u></a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sad reality is there simply weren’t enough racing games released in 2024, full stop. For the first time I can remember in my nearly 14 years at IGN, we didn’t even hand out an award for the year’s best racer. There just weren’t enough of them to even pad out a list of finalists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sad stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, for clarity, I <em>have </em>had a number of fresh reasons to slide behind a steering wheel this year, but the bulk of these opportunities have arrived as updates to existing racing games I already own. Most months of 2024 have seen an injection of new cars and content for Gran Turismo 7. As is usually the case with GT, not <em>all </em>those cars have had a solid racing pedigree, but I won’t pretend I’m not at least mildly interested in seeing how fast an eight-year-old Toyota Hiace can lap the Nordschleife.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A 2024 expansion to EA Sports WRC added several new cars and two new countries: Latvia and Poland. The new countries feature some excellent stages, and it makes a lot more sense for Codemasters to improve WRC this way than immediately put it on a yearly, F1-style cadence (if only the asking price for the DLC wasn’t as uncomfortably close to the cost of an entirely new game anyway).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I won’t pretend I’m not at least mildly interested in seeing how fast an eight-year-old Toyota Hiace can lap the Nordschleife</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On the flip side, The Crew Motorfest literally became 50% larger for free, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-crew-motorfest-official-season-5-launch-trailer">all players getting access to the entire island of Maui</a>, added to Motorfest in November. Maui is not a bespoke area; it’s been seamlessly injected into the game’s existing world (and developer Ivory Tower has even added a fantasy connecting bridge, meaning you have a choice to either fly, boat, or drive to Maui from O’ahu without any loading screens. It admittedly hasn’t turned me into a Motorfest regular, but there <em>are </em>some satisfying stretches of road and some nice areas on Maui – which is obviously a lot quieter than the more densely-populated O’ahu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown has grown in a similar fashion with its Ibiza expansion (although don’t expect a bridge from Hong Kong to the Mediterranean). Solar Crown’s Ibiza map is a fairly small section of the island that may come as a nostalgic bonus for those players who recall blasting around the Spanish party paradise in 2011’s Test Drive Unlimited 2, but it’s hard to say whether it’ll turn around Solar Crown’s slow start. The map, after all, wasn’t Solar Crown’s main problem.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mount Panorama has finally found its way back into Forza Motorsport in its most-recent update, but I have to admit I’m extremely disappointed with all the fake sponsors used throughout the track. It just makes it appear totally inauthentic compared to Bathurst in Assetto Corsa Competizione, Gran Turismo 7, and even Forza Motorsport 7 – all of which feature real sponsors. It feels like a bizarre step backwards for the series, but hopefully it can be redressed. The update arrived along with a bunch of antipodean automobiles that have largely been seen in the series before, but nonetheless appeal to me as a dedicated Australian meathead. There’s only one new car, but it <em>is </em>a great one: a 1991 HSV Commodore VN Group A SV. If there’s one thing I like more than Australian cars, it’s the 1990s, so this fills both of those criteria. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/21/forza-vn-commodore-1734777778443.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Despite its faults, Forza Motorsport's garage philosophy is still more global than GT or NFS.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And speaking of the ’90s, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/need-for-speed-unbound-vol-9-official-reveal-trailer">Need for Speed Unbound just added a motorbike</a>, which is a surprising and impressive first for a series that’s literally celebrating <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/need-for-speed-turns-30-the-lasting-legacy-of-eas-fastest-franchise"><u>30 years since its 1994 debut this month.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, sure, there’s been plenty of tinkering still going on beneath the bonnets of most of the biggest racers in the business, but very little new blood in the genre in 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s worrisome, particularly as younger generations continue to exhibit an increasing disinterest in cars in general, but I do think 2024 is probably just an aberration.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Greatest Racing Games Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I say this because 2025 is looking extremely exciting in the racing space. Assetto Corsa Evo promises to be one of the biggest racers of the year and, with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/massive-open-world-map-confirmed-for-assetto-corsa-evo"><u>1,600-square kilometre open world map</u></a> in development for it, I do mean that literally. JDM: Japanese Drift Master from Polish studio Gaming Factory has shown promise for some time, and you can already check out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364930/JDM_Rise_of_the_Scorpion/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>free demo of this on Steam now.</u></a> Tokyo Xtreme Racer is set to return after a nearly 20-year absence. Project CARS spiritual successor Project Motor Racing is scheduled to arrive in 2025. It’s got the Lister Storm in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes please.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s just some of what we know about already. Will Wreckfest 2 arrive in 2025? The planned release date for that is yet to be confirmed, but that should be something special. Is 2025 the year we hear about the future of Forza Horizon? Next year will mark four years since Forza Horizon 5, after all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Either way, I’ll see you at the starting line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.
