Expect lots of dangers and obstacles to overcome in an alpine environment, rather than Tatooine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end of August brings the month's two biggest Game Pass additions, beginning with the day one launch of Gears of War: Reloaded on August 26 (Cloud, PC and Xbox Series X/S) for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers. This is the polished-up vrsion of the classic first Gears game, now with all post-launch content, multiplayer maps and cosmetics included. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, on August 28, Dragon Age: The Veilguard (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S) joins Microsoft's subscription service for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass members.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Feet first into Helldivers.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s official: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> is getting a Legendary Warbond featuring weapons and cosmetics from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-3-odst"><u>Halo: ODST</u></a>, and its release date arrives in one week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead Game Studios announced the highly anticipated crossover news on social media today, revealing a first-look trailer for the Helldivers 2 Halo content that players will soon get their hands on. It’s a collaboration with Microsoft that arrives ahead of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-published-helldivers-2-gets-shock-release-date-on-xbox-series-x-and-s"><u>the game’s launch on Xbox Series X/S August 26, 2025</u></a>, with the new Warbond tier and all of its ODST goodies set to drop that same day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O_9hwQ8jLw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>trailer for the Helldivers 2 Halo content</u></a> shows what some of the new content looks like in-game, but Microsoft made sure to offer more information in a new Xbox Wire <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-halo-odst-crossover-warbond-xbox-launch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>blog post</u></a>. Players who pick up the Legendary Warbond will be treated to four weapons (three primary, one sidearm), four vehicle patterns, an armor passive, two player banners, two capes, one player title, and, of course, two armor sets that look like they were ripped straight out of Halo 3: ODST.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see everything included in the Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond in the image below. As for that mysterious Feet First armor passive, players can expect a buff that allows them to make less noise when moving, become immune to leg injuries, and increase their discovery range by 30%.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-halo-odst-warbond-1755617979176.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond. Image courtesy of Arrowhead Game Studios.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Earth veterans will note that the Arrowhead is using the Halo crossover to introduce Legendary Warbonds as a completely new tier for its content packs. That means it’ll be more expensive, too, running players about 1,500 Super Credits (about $15). That’s up from the usual 1,000 Super Credits (about $10) players have come to expect with non-crossover packs, but Arrowhead says it will be worth the price of admission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Legendary Warbond marks a brand-new tier in the Warbond lineup, and we’ve gone all-in to make sure it lives up to the name,” the studio said in a statement. “This one’s a tribute to a long-requested crossover, packed with details that fans will love to discover.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead also clarifies that the new Premium Warbond Tokens, which also launch August 26, cannot be used to unlock the Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond. Despite this, players seem to be taking the price announcement well.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This isnt egregious. A lil pricey, but ultimately acceptable.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fine.

With such a highly anticipated crossover finally making its way to all platforms, many expected to see Arrowhead take the opportunity to significantly increase its price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo content in Helldivers 2 also follows the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2s-killzone-crossover-has-already-sparked-an-outcry-over-the-super-high-cost-of-items"><u>controversy surrounding the inclusion of Killzone content late last year</u></a>. While players were happy to see collaborations find their way into the game at the time, they were not happy with how it was handled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead of delivering the Killzone content in the form of a traditional Warbond, players needed to spend nearly 2,000 Super Credits for a smaller selection of individually priced content. Making matters worse was the announcement that everything would only be available for a limited amount of time before being rotated out of the Superstore.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead eventually went on to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-insists-its-to-blame-for-killzone-pricing-debacle-amid-concern-over-sony-influence"><u>apologize</u></a> for its handling of Killzone Healldivers 2 content, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-gives-all-players-next-weeks-killzone-items-for-free-following-pricing-backlash-and-theyre-available-now"><u>gifting all players some of the crossover-themed goodies</u></a> for free while promising to do better in the future.

Fergusson <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rod-fergusson-departs-blizzard-diablo-franchise">departed Blizzard earlier this month</a> with no word on why he left, or who would replace him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was gleaned from an email sent by 2K president David Ismailer to staff and subsequently shared with IGN. It reads, in part:</p><blockquote>Work on the next BioShock game has been underway for several years. While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development. </blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Employees impacted are being informed today. 2K did not share how many were impacted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I recognize that today is a day of mixed emotions," the email concludes. "We’re excited to have Rod joining us, and are equally grateful to everyone at Cloud Chamber who has helped us get this far. These changes are rooted in 2K’s firm confidence in BioShock as one of the most beloved franchises, and our commitment to deliver the best game in franchise history."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioShock 4 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/13/2k-studio-reportedly-developing-new-bioshock">first reported on in 2018</a>, and news has been few and far between since. We know it's been in development at Cloud Chamber at least since then, and that former BioShock lead Ken Levine is not working on it. We've yet to see any gameplay or learn much about the game beyond that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-setting-rapture-columbia-job-listings">takes place in a brand new setting</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-bioshock-game-hiring-writer-for-open-world-setting">is open world</a>. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Bloomberg report stated</a> that the game would be undergoing a development overhaul after it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-reportedly-getting-a-narrative-overhaul-amid-development-struggles">criticized by executives for narrative issues</a>. When we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question">asked Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick about this a week later</a>, he reassured that BioShock 4 was "going to come out" for certain, but did not share information as to when, or what needed to be done to get it there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Inscryption is one of those experiences. This game beautifully blends genres in such a unique way that it's hard to really describe. I first went into gameplay thinking it was just a cool roguelike deck-building card game, which would have been interesting enough. But no, it's so much more than that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without spoiling anything important, I'll just say that Inscryption has a lot more depth than you'd expect and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/inscryption/Ending_Explained">pretty wild ending</a>. If you like the thrill of psychological horror <em>and</em> strategy, I can't recommend this game enough – especially when it's only $7.99. Just try not to read too much about it before you start playing so you can get the full experience.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Inscryption Is on Sale for $7.99 on PC</h2><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227072"><div id="227072" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Inscryption</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Available for PC and Mac.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At $7.99, this matches the lowest price we've ever <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1092790/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seen the game go on Steam</a>. The latest discount is thanks to Humble Bundle's Summer Sale going on right now. According to the Humble Bundle website, this discount will last through <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/labor-day-sales">Labor Day</a>, so you have plenty of time to decide if you want it or not. Alongside Inscryption, this sale includes a ton of other PC games at some of the lowest prices of the year.

Here's a snippet of what we though in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inscryption-review">review of Inscryption</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>"Inscryption is a surprising and delightful meta-twist on the digital card games that have exploded in recent years. Its unsettling story is the perfect vehicle for its ever-evolving mechanics, which constantly keep the simple but entertaining card game at its heart fresh. It’s a wonderfully strange game, but Inscryption is truly excellent because it’s also a genuinely fun one – and like Pony Island before it, you should probably go in knowing as little as possible."</em> - Tom Marks</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 19, 2025 3:36 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/one-of-my-favorite-pc-games-of-all-time-is-super-cheap-during-the-humble-bundle-summer-sale]]></content:encoded>
