There’s 3D audio, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keyboard and mouse control support includes new control customization options, including full control remapping, primary and secondary bindings for keyboard and mouse control, and an adaptive mode that allows players to combine keyboard and controller inputs. There’s full gamepad support, while DualSense controllers feature full haptic feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC offers a wide range of graphics settings and presets, to ensure the best possible experience on hardware ranging from high-end PCs to handheld gaming devices,” Sony said.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Last of Us Part 2 PC specs:</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/20/tlou-specs-1742492089994.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">TLOU 2 Remastered PC specs.

Bill is a “Smuggler” playstyle who can access a custom pump shotgun from dead drops, and receives double rewards from drops as well. He’s stronger against melee attacks but can’t dodge. Marlene, meanwhile, features a “Risk Taker” playstyle that includes a Custom Assault Rifle, “All or Nothing” gambits, can reroute her No Return path once per run, and more.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/20/54393525277-2ff5b3926b-o-1742492128554.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">New characters are coming to No Return mode. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Four new maps are coming to No Return, too.</p><blockquote>Overlook, which is set high above the city of Seattle and features plenty of verticality, is the memorable site of a Seraphites encounter in the campaign. School is, during the campaign, the abandoned elementary school in which Ellie and Dina face off against the W.L.F. Streets is set in the overgrown Seattle neighborhood of Hillcrest, while Nest will be familiar to players who have played as Abby through an Infected-infested building. We’ve been so overjoyed about the reaction to this mode since Part II Remastered debuted on PS5 last year, and we hope these new maps further offer more variability and thrills as players tackle new runs.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/20/54396469192-cc5a754825-h-1742492165310.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">No Return is set for four new maps.

But if you do log in to PSN, you get PlayStation overlay and PSN Trophies. As an extra incentive, Sony said those who sign in with their PSN account also get access to 50 in-game points to activate bonus features, as well as a new skin for Ellie featuring Jordan A. Mun’s jacket from Naughty Dog’s new PS5 game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/20/54394636943-89001e0b8f-o-1742492213413.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ellie has a new skin featuring Jordan A.

It’s included in the 2.0 patch and unlockable via in-game bonus points.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann shared more details about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet"><u>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</u></a>. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>interview</u></a> with Alex Garland, the writer of zombie movie 28 Days Later, Druckmann talked candidly about the development process, confirming Intergalactic has been in the works for four years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I joke about this with the team. We made a game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-2">The Last of Us 2</a>, we made certain creative decisions that got us a lot of hate. A lot of people love it, but a lot of people hate that game," Druckmann said, to which Garland joked: "Who gives a shit?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Exactly," Druckmann added. "But the joke is like, you know what, let's do something that people won't care as much about — let's make a game about faith and religion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which stars Tati Gabrielle as Jordan A. Mun, takes place in an alternate historical timeline and features a "pretty prominent religion" that has "changed and bastardized and evolved" over the years, Druckmann said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PC version of The Last of Us 2 Remastered arrives ahead of Season 2 of HBO's hit TV adaptation. Showrunners Druckmann and Craig Mazin have confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-theres-a-dramatic-reason-spores-are-back-for-the-last-of-us-season-2"><u>“spores are back” following their omission from Season 1</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
