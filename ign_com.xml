When the door opens, two other Pikachu are waiting outside dressed and ready for vacation. One, a male Pikachu (based on the tail shape) is wearing a floral polo shirt, sunglasses, and a big white sunhat with a flower. The other, a female Pika, has on a blue and pink floral sundress and a blue baseball cap also with a flower. Her cheeks are pink instead of red.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are, apparently, Mr. Windychu and Ms. Wavychu, and no, I'm not making those names up.

Pikachu is no stranger to being dressed up – heck, there was even an obtainable Cosplay Pikachu in Pokémon OmegaRuby and AlphaSapphire, and Pikachu has been dressed up in all sorts of outfits for merchandise and in spinoffs like Pokémon GO.  But these two seem to be important NPCs who will be involved in the story somehow. Perhaps each one is version exclusive? Maybe we'll be able to obtain them as a trainer? Maybe they belong to the game's professor? Who knows?

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-pokmon-pikachu-set-72152</link>
            <guid>1449271</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO and Pokémon were my childhood (well, those and TMNT, but that’s for another time). I grew up building everything from simple cars and unrealistic houses to whatever amalgamation my creative mind could imagine. Never, as a kid, did I expect to see a fully licensed Pokémon set like the one we have now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I was a child, Pokémon was a game that, even now 30 years later, still has its claws in me with no sign of letting up. My younger siblings and I spent hours as kids, sitting with our Link Cables and GameBoys, trading Pokémon back and forth while we restarted one of our games enough times so we could each start with all three starter Pokémon. I knew I was hooked after spending an afternoon at my grandfather's house manually typing out my own Pokémon guide listing every Pokémon, their evolution levels, and what level they learned each move.</p><div id="234362"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234362" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pikachu and Poké Ball - LEGO Pokemon</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no Pokémon more iconic to the franchise than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Pikachu">Pikachu</a>, and while this set's first images weren’t as impressive as I’d hoped, I've changed my mind after building it and seeing it up close. As I gaze at it sitting on my shelf surrounded by other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-plushies">Pokémon plushes</a>, statues, and numerous other Pokémon collectibles, I have to admit that it looks great! Is it perfect? No, but man, it’s a very welcome addition to my collection.</p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>With Pokémon celebrating its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/pokemon-presents-30th-anniversary-livestream-watch-party-post-show">30th anniversary</a>, it’s the perfect time to build this latest collaboration and go back to the series' roots, even though Pikachu wouldn’t be a selectable starter until Pokémon Yellow’s 1997/1998 release. LEGO provided IGN with a review set for a test build, and I was excited and fortunate enough to be the one to put it together. This 2,050-piece build took me around six hours to complete, which was long enough to revisit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/pokemon-the-first-movie">Pokémon: The First Movie</a> (that big final moment still brings tears to my eyes), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/detective-pikachu-the-movie">Detective Pikachu</a>, and a couple of other Pokémon movies that were available to stream. </p><p>In the earlier steps, I was confused as to why our favorite little yellow mouse had so many vibrant pinks, teals, and other non-Pikachu-specific colors while building. However, as I finished the steps and his torso began to take shape, I realized all the additional colors would be hidden in the final build, and were there to make piecing together the inside easier. </p></div><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Lego Pikachu Build Slideshow</h3></div></span></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It showed me how far LEGO has come in reducing complications and making larger builds faster to complete. I couldn’t help but smile after hitting major milestones in the build, and had the biggest one of them all when I settled Pikachu into his final resting position surrounded by the plastic lightning, making his action pose even more dynamic.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest drawback to this LEGO Pikachu set is the $199.99 price tag; it's not much larger (size-wise) than its more affordable counterpart, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-pokemon-eevee-set-72151">Eevee</a>, and it doesn’t feel as epic as the much more expensive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-pokemon-venusaur-charizard-and-blastoise-set-72153">Kanto starters set</a>. Pikachu’s set comes with 16 bags. The first nine build the electric mouse #25 (National Pokédex) himself, while the remaining seven build his Poke Ball and the base to attach him to. The instruction manual is the same as the other Pokémon sets and comes with a Pokédex entry for Pikachu, as well as a look back on his history with the franchise, which was fun to remind myself of how far he and this franchise have come. Steps are well organized throughout the building process, and while the first few steps may look nothing like Pikachu, they quickly take shape as you move into the middle steps. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to the Eevee build, as you progress, you will assemble sections, leaving small pockets open to eventually attach its articulable arms, legs, ears, and tail. Pikachu’s build starts with the internal portions of his torso, neck, and head, then adds the external rounded pieces to give him his iconic look. His lightning bolt-shaped tail and base were the highlights of the build for me, and they look great in LEGO form, accentuating Pikachu’s design. These steps were the simplest parts of the build, but they were also the most satisfying for me. Pikachu also features a few fun, swappable parts that can easily be adjusted for a new look. Swapping a hinge inside the pokeball converts it from open to closed. Pikachu can stand on his own or attach to his slanted stand (my preference), and you can swap the endcap pieces on Pikachu’s tail, swapping between heart-shaped (female) and pointed (male). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While not perfect, Pikachu’s feet are surprisingly pose-able to help with balancing him. Just take precautions during the build, because mine did take a tumble or two. His arms, however, are limited to vertical mobility and are prone to detaching if you try to adjust them too far outside that range. The good news is they are extremely easy to reattach should that occur, as it did to me a few times while rotating to attach new pieces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">His ears are also fantastic for articulation, as they can be rotated and angled freely, allowing you to quickly change his look. I only wish the set had a few more alternate pieces, like his mouth, to change his expression. There were only a few steps throughout the build process that gave me some trouble, and one of them was attaching the single round pieces to the center of another round piece. This made sense as one of the last words that comes to mind for me when I hear the word LEGO is round, which made these complications understandable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final portion of most steps is adorning Pikachu with pieces that help distinguish him from any other pile of yellow bricks. Thankfully, Pikachu’s eyes and mouth are printed on pieces, so no worries about ruining a set with a slightly misplaced sticker or anything of that nature. The eyes and mouth are both singular pieces to attach while his cheeks are a simple combination of pieces to give them their rounded appearance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After completing Pikachu himself, the last things to build are his Poké Ball and lightning bolt-shaped stand, which made up the last seven bags of pieces. Though that's 40% of the bags, it's also filled with lots of larger flat pieces and was the quickest part of the build. This was great because I built it in two sittings, making getting to the finish line easier and all the more enjoyable. </p><p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"><div data-cy="poll-content-block"><form action="#" data-cy="poll-content"><fieldset role="radiogroup" aria-labelledby="poll-question"><legend><span><h2 data-cy="poll-question" id="poll-question">What generation of Pokemon Starters should get a Lego set next? </h2></span></legend><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64792" id="answerId64792-label"><span>Gen 1 (Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64793" id="answerId64793-label"><span>Gen 2 (Chikorita, Cyndaquil, Totodile)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64794" id="answerId64794-label"><span>Gen 3 (Treecko, Torchic, Mudkip)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64795" id="answerId64795-label"><span>Gen 4 (Turtwig, Chimchar, Piplup)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64796" id="answerId64796-label"><span>Gen 5 ( Snivy, Tepig, Oshawott)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64797" id="answerId64797-label"><span>Gen 6 (Chespin, Fennekin, Froakie)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64798" id="answerId64798-label"><span>Gen 7 (Rowlett, Litten, Popplio)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64799" id="answerId64799-label"><span>Gen 8 ( Grookey, Scorbunny, Sobble)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64800" id="answerId64800-label"><span>Gen 9 (Sprigatito, Fuecoco, Quaxly) </span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64801" id="answerId64801-label"><span>Gen 10 (Browt, Ponbon, Gecqua) </span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div></fieldset><span></span></form></div></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pikachu may not be my favorite Pokémon (Bulbasaur, you know, I had to include him in here at least once), but it was still an incredibly fun build and a wonderful addition to my collection. Each step after the first few clearly showcases what you're building, from the memorable stripes on its back to its lightning-bolt-shaped tail. For those who love Pikachu, I think this is an easy recommendation if you have the cash to spare. The pictures and marketing don’t really do this one justice; it's one of those sets that look much better in person. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jada Griffin is IGN's Community Lead.

As Bloomberg shares, Bluepoint was working on a live-service God of War game, following its acquisition by Sony, and support work on God of War Ragnarok. The God of War game would have involved Atreus falling into Hades and different "versions" of him battling through it with some kind of cooperative element.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea didn't really coalesce and Bluepoint, famous for more traditional action games, was a poor fit for the project, so it was canceled in January 2025. The studio was encouraged to pitch other ideas, and the one that made the most sense was a remake of 2015's amazing, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review">IGN 9.1/10</a>, Bloodborne.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/another-bloodborne-state-of-play-no-show-leaves-fans-questioning-if-ps5-port-will-ever-happen">Fans have begged for a Bloodborne remake or sequel for years</a>, with all sorts of rumors cropping up that one might be in the works at any given time. Popular belief has been that Sony, as the IP owner, is what stands in the way of FromSoftware actually making one. But according to Bloomberg, that may not be the case. According to those working at the studio, they were told that while Sony was interested in a Bloodborne remake, FromSoftware was not, and the idea was scrapped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodborne's status has long been in limbo, with various individuals with ties to the project sharing conflicting thoughts on what can be made of it. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5">Back in 2024</a>, FromSoftware director Hidetaka Miyazaki said it was "not in my place" to talk about a Bloodborne remake because FromSoftware does not own the IP. He also told Eurogamer at the time that the game would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">benefit from a release on modern hardware</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, the following year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hasnt-sony-done-anything-more-with-bloodborne-playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-personal-theory">PlayStation's Shuhei Yoshida offered a theory on KindaFunny</a> as to what was going on with Bloodborne that may match up with what happened to Bluepoint's pitch:</p><blockquote>Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing. And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.</blockquote><blockquote>I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The question of why no one seems to want to hit such an obvious home run, or let someone like Bluepoint hit it for them, remains. FromSoftware is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-is-making-a-new-vampire-game-for-nintendo-switch-2-but-its-not-bloodborne-2">currently hard at work on The Duskbloods</a>, a similarly vampire-themed game exclusive to Nintendo Switch 2. As for Bluepoint, it reportedly went on to pitch other ideas, such as an updated Shadow of the Colossus and a spin-off of Ghost of Tsushima, before it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-demons-souls-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-games">tragically shut down by Sony</a>, with leaders believing the studio was not equipped to make its own game and was unable to find a sensible partnership. Per Bloomberg, some companies are currently in talks to see if they can save the studio and take it off Sony's hands, but no word yet as to how successful that might be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">You may have clicked into this review thinking, “A review of Under Night In-Birth 2 Sys:Celes? In the year of our Lord 2026?!” And you know what, that’s fair. This fighting game came out at the beginning of 2024, and it’s one that builds off a foundation laid by the 2012 original, which we also never reviewed<em>.</em> Well, I’ve decided better late than never, because Under Night In-Birth 2 is quite simply one of the best 2D fighters on the market right now – especially for fighting game fans that pine for the days of fast-paced anime fighters but with all the modern conveniences we’ve come to expect. It’s full of gorgeous pixel art and completely outlandish character designs alongside things like exceptional netcode and the ability to take control of a character during a replay, making its satisfyingly steep learning curve a joy to try and overcome, and its online play a staple of my fighting game rotation well past its initial launch.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mitchell's Favorite Fighting Games</h3></p><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/Mitchell-IGN/lists/mitchells-favorite-fighting-games" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">For those completely unfamiliar, Under Night In-Birth (or just UNI for short) is the first wholly original series from Japanese developer French Bread, which was previously known mostly for Melty Blood, a 2D fighter based on the world and characters of the visual novel Tsukihime. The UNI games are four-button fighters with light, medium, and heavy attack buttons, as well as the Exs Action button, which has a number of uses ranging from short hops, to defensive shields, to meter management, etc. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s really cool about this fighting system at a basic level is that while most fighting games have a linear sort of logic to their combo system, allowing you to chain lights into mediums into heavies, UNI kind of just says “screw it, do what you want, it’ll work.” You can chain heavies into lights and lights into heavies, or convert big combos off of little pokes. Anytime you land any sort of touch in UNI, you can get big damage off of it, which is a very liberating feeling.</p><p>You can get big damage off any touch, which is a very liberating feeling.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also makes jumping into the shallow end of a new character very intuitive, even though they’re all <em>so </em>different from each other. I wouldn’t dare take a brand new character into online play and try to get by  using simple combos alone, but if all you’re going to do is play through Arcade mode or mash some buttons against a similarly skilled friend, UNI’s flexible fighting system makes it very easy to do so on a casual level without relying solely on auto-combos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t let any of that fool you into thinking UNI is easy, though. The game speed is lightning fast, its zoning can feel utterly oppressive if you don't know how to deal with it, and the mixups certain characters can do will make you feel like you just got utterly blended. You really need to make use of its many different mechanics to be able to fight on an even playing field, and learning those is going to take some time – and for the more casual fighting game fan, it may even feel a bit like homework.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the heart of UNI is the GRD system, and there’s really nothing else quite like it in the expansive world of 2D fighters. Basically, imagine it as a tug-of-war-style minigame that runs parallel to the actual fighting, with the winner being granted a pretty massive advantage for a limited amount of time. At the bottom of the screen, you’ll see a meter comprised of six diamonds on either side. You fill your side of the meter by moving forward, landing attacks, blocking, using the riskier (but more rewarding) shield block, and by holding down the Exs Action button to sit still and charge it up like you’re a Dragon Ball Z character raising your power level. You can also lose meter by moving backwards, getting hit, or having your own attacks blocked by the opponent’s shield block. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this push and pull is happening, a timer will continue to circle around the middle of the meter, and once it’s up, the person with more of that meter filled wins the minigame and will enter the Vorpal State. While in the Vorpal State, you deal 10% more damage and gain the ability to use a technique called Chain Shift, which allows you to cancel the recovery of any move – much like a Roman Cancel in the Guilty Gear series – and also convert some of your diamonds from the GRD meter into your EXS meter, which governs your ability to use super moves and EX special moves. </p><p>GRD is unusual, it's complicated, but it's also kind of brilliant. <span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unusual, it’s complicated, but it’s also kind of brilliant. It encourages aggressive play while equally rewarding skillful defense; it’s largely negligible at lower levels of play, so newcomers don’t even have to worry about it, while more skilled fighters must split their focus between attacking the opponent in front of them and consider how their actions affect the GRD meter. It also further encourages careful meter and resource management, which is something every great modern fighting game benefits from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I love the way fighting games look these days; Arc System Works, in particular, does an incredible job of blending 3D characters in 2D environments and reaping the benefits of both dimensions. But  I’m also just a huge sucker for incredible 2D sprite art, and UNI’s characters rank up there among the best. Whether it’s the wild flowing hair and flailing limbs of Minerva, the lightning-fast speed and rapid slashes of Seth, or the hilariously gargantuan arms of Waldstein, the 24 characters (plus three more as paid DLC) of UNI2 absolutely brim with personality and flair. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/2026-02-27-10-00-44-3-1772215670346.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m a big fan of rushdown characters, so Linne was the first one I gravitated towards, and I was initially taken aback by just how “rushdown” she actually was. Her run speed is incredibly fast, allowing her to close the distance from full screen in basically the blink of an eye. Even without learning her big damage combos, it’s a ton of fun to look for that slight opening to get in and then utterly blitzing my opponent with a fairly basic strike/throw gameplan. I’m at the point now where I definitely need to dig a little deeper into her moveset and find better ways to open people up, and fortunately, the teaching tools that UNI2 provides are stellar as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a mission mode that gives you a basic overview of how to play each character, along with a wide variety of combos that cover just about every situation you could imagine sorted by difficulty. You’ve got quick, low-hitting combos you can use from point-blank range, overhead combos, combos that come out of your farthest reaching poke, anti-air combos, corner combos, and better versions of previous combos that build upon what you’ve already learned to squeeze out just a bit more damage. Once you get all the way down to the bottom, that’s where you’ll learn the big damage combos that incorporate Chain Shifts, super moves, and other high level techniques. It’s pretty much everything you need to build a full game plan with a character, all packed within the actual game itself, which should be the standard for any modern fighting game. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The unfortunate thing for anyone looking to learn about these characters by playing through their story mode, however, is that you’re going to feel buried under a mountain of jargon and names that won’t mean anything to you if you didn’t play the previous games in the series. The world and lore of Under Night is extensive, and there’s no effort made in this version to catch new players up on what “The Hollow Night” is, what the heck “EXS” is, or even what an “In-Birth” means. You are getting dropped into the supposed final chapter of a story, after all. Still, some sort of index or compendium would have gone a long way toward making these otherwise fairly dry arcade mode stories a bit easier to follow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In general, UNI2 is lacking in content outside of its central modes. If you’re not a serious fighting game player who wants to grind online play and make use of its fantastic teaching tools to get better, there’s not going to be a ton here to hold your interest. Fortunately, if you <em>are </em>one of those people, UNI2 does have a feature that many AAA fighting games still don’t: Replay Takeover. While watching a replay, you’re able to take control of one of the characters at any point. This allows you to repeat something that gave you trouble in a match and try to find a way to learn from it. Like, for example, an offensive sequence that you got hit with that seemed air tight when you were in the moment – when you run it back, you might be able to find a spot where you could use an invincible reversal attack, or maybe your shield to push the opponent back far enough that their next attack wouldn’t have landed. Just like in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-review">Street Fighter 6</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>, and the scant few other fighting games that have this feature, it’s an absolute godsend when it comes to improving your matchup knowledge. </p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Under Night In-Birth 2 Sys:Celes is a 2D fighter for people who love 2D Fighters, myself included. It’s incredibly deep, has a rich and well-rounded roster with some of the coolest looking characters around, features excellent teaching tools to give you everything you need to improve, and even comes with replay takeover for the truly hardcore that intend to watch their matches back and learn from their mistakes. A lot of those excellent features (as well as its great rollback netcode) may go completely unnoticed for the more casual audience, and the lack of context in story mode will no doubt make newcomers feel lost without a flashlight when it comes to navigating it’s dense lore. But as far as the most important aspects of a 2D fighter go, Under Night In-Birth 2 ranks up there with the best of them.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/under-night-in-birth-2-sysceles-review]]></content:encoded>
