No release date, or any additional details for that matter, were revealed in the post outside of the team’s plans to add support at some point in the future. For now, Warhorse simply said that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 mods will allow players to “create, tweak, and expand” as they please. While unofficial mods for the project continue to flourish through sites like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nexus Mods</a>, an official image teaser, below, shows off what Henry might look like with a vibrant Zebra mount and fish sword.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/12/022317bee3f7109c63db2b160e0b8c55677e41c6-1739384061111.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is getting official mod support.

In addition to mod support on Steamworks, players have been told to expect three expansions in 2025. DLC drops start in the summer with the Brushes with Death expansion, with Legacy of the Forge following in the fall and Mysteria Ecclesia scheduled for the winter. Each will build on Henry’s story while free content updates add things like Hardcore Mode and Horse Racing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhorse is only getting started when it comes to the post-launch support for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-already-sold-1-million-copies-dev-calls-it-a-triumph"><u>its massively popular sequel</u></a>.
