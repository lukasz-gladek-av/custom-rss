            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But he has a three-point plan to fix it.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In an impassioned end to his keynote address on the opening day of Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show in Bangkok, Dead Space creator and industry veteran Glen Schofield has declared that the games industry is in dire need of fixing, and he believes he knows just how to go about it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We need to fix the gaming industry right now,” said Schofield to a room of games industry professionals. “It's broken. It's beaten, it's battered, our developers are battered, they've been taking it on the chin for the last couple of years. We need to bring it back to what it was, right? Instead of all this negativity.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first and arguably most controversial step to take in Schofield’s opinion, is for the games industry to widely embrace the use of generative AI as a standard part of their development tool set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“AI isn’t here to replace us,” continued Schofield. “It’s here to make us faster, better, and more efficient. And AI is for all of us, it really is. It’s not just for directors and artists, it’s for writers and marketing execs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, I think [games industry] executives, owners, founders… Let's start training our people on AI. Start it as soon as you can. Who cares if I’m EA or Activision or Namco or whatever, we should be working together at least in training and training our people up. That would be a huge help because I know we’re going to start hiring people back again.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, Schofield believes that investors need to loosen their purse strings and start spending more on games development, as well as putting the right people in charge of each studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Come on, investors and execs, let’s stop this madness,” said Schofield. “You want to make a AAA game for like eight million dollars? You gotta get your guts back again. If we start putting money into the industry again, we know it's going to make money.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To me, you picked the wrong people to run the teams, to run the games, right? In my opinion [you need] a big, creative person who’s running it. And then you put people around to help with this and that. That's the way I work these days, right? I still run my studio in ways but I have people to help now so I can be 100% or 98% on that. That’s what these games need. I saw some of the people that were chosen and they were really good people, but there's no way they were ready to direct a game.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I said, let's start putting money in, do due diligence a little better on that. We know we're going to make money. But we have to make quality games, and you have to give them to the right people.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, and perhaps most strangely given that he was presenting the opening keynote address at a rival games industry show, Schofield wished for the return of E3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bring back E3,” said Schofield to soft applause. “I mean, come on. E3 is the granddaddy of them all. And I will tell you every single E3 that I went to made my games better. And I know there's no formula to show a [return on investment] on that, [but] every game got better when you went there. You talked with your friends, you talked with colleagues, everybody's thrilled to help you with the next technologies, or showing you mechanics. When the companies started going outside of E3 I knew this was the end, and I started boycotting those because [that] was not an industry that was working together, this is an industry that’s fragmented. And so now there’s no E3.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Schofield concluded his address by reiterating that while he’s fully onboard with AI, the most important aspect of games development were the people making them, not the machines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Remember, ideas are the lifeblood of the industry,” said Schofield, speaking to the developers in attendance. “And those ideas? They come from you.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How do you feel about Schofield’s plan to “fix” the games industry?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new offline mode for Ubisoft’s The Crew 2 is available now, which will allow owners to play the racing MMO offline if desired. The functionality – dubbed Hybrid Mode – has been explained in full on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/the-crew/the-crew-2/news-updates/zs6ZFyLEQvKbFskEJZolR/the-crew-2-hybrid-mode-is-now-available" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>publisher’s website</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Ubisoft, Hybrid Mode gives us the “freedom to choose” how we want to play The Crew 2. That is, online mode (which is “the original experience as it was designed from the start, complete with multiplayer features, leaderboards, summits, and community sharing”) or offline mode (which the publisher describes as “a new experience”).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Whether you’re looking to preserve your progression for the future or simply enjoy the freedom of playing without a connection, Hybrid Mode ensures The Crew 2 remains accessible for years to come,” explains the publisher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To transfer progression into offline mode, players can simply select “Export to Offline Save” after a session online. Doing so will create a copy of current progression in the game’s multiplayer world stored locally on a personal PC or console. Ubisoft notes online and offline saves are separate, however, so progress made offline will not carry back over into online saves. Players will be able to re-export online saves to update offline files at any time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Custom liveries will not transfer to offline saves.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">An offline mode for The Crew 2 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-adding-offline-modes-to-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-but-the-original-is-gone-for-good"><u>was announced last year</u></a> in the wake of the the shutdown of the original game in March 2024. Disappointed players of The Crew (which was not a free-to-play game, but became inaccessible for its owners to play after its shutdown – even solo) were justifiably concerned about The Crew 2 suffering the same fate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We heard your concerns about access to The Crew games,” Ubisoft said at the time. “Today, we want to express our commitment to the future of The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. We can confirm an offline mode to ensure long term access to both titles.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft was subsequently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-sued-after-shutting-down-the-crew"><u>sued after the shutdown</u></a>, a lawsuit the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisofts-the-crew-lawsuit-insists-we-do-not-own-the-games-we-buy"><u>publisher responded to</u></a> by insisting that buying a game doesn’t give players “unfettered ownership rights” to it, but rather only a “limited license to access the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.
