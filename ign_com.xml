            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield Studios is prepping for BF Labs testing by giving fans a first look at content coming to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> Season 2 and beyond, including the reveal of one brand-new map and a returning Battlefield 4 map.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio discussed its plans to get back on track with behind-closed-doors testing in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-battlefield-labs-season-2-testing-and-beyond?utm_campaign=gla_bci_ww_ic_soco_twt_battlefield-6-community-update-battlefield-labs-season-2-testing-and-beyond&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=88242&amp;ts=1769013330100" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>blog post</u></a> published on its website. It’s a lengthy message from the EA team that comes with a few highlights as it attempts to win back fans who may have been turned off by the recent delay of Season 2.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/21/battlefield-6-contaminated-1769016546557.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6 Season 2 Contaminated Map First Look. Image courtesy of EA.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 players want new maps, and BF Studios wants to deliver. We don’t know how many new maps will be included in Season 2, but the Labs blog post confirms the name of one of the new locations: Contaminated. The studio says that, in terms of size, it falls between Season 1 map Eastwood and launch map Mirak Valley, while also comparing it to Battlefield 1’s St. Quentin Scar and Battlefield V’s Arras.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ll be evaluating how vehicle gameplay and aerial presence interact with infantry combat, alongside cover and asset placement, and objective boundaries,” the post says of upcoming pre-release tests. “We’ll also be testing how the map’s unique gameplay mechanics function in live matches, as well as the tools available to players to interact with them.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A first-look, work-in-progress image of the map (above) shows a rocky mountain battleground. Fog and forest both overlook what appears to be a small aircraft runway, with snipers perched between the trees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to pick out one defining feature from the new map with such a limited look, but BF Studios has something a little more familiar planned for the future. Buried in the “On the Horizon” section of the Labs blog post is the announcement that a “fan-favorite” Battlefield 4 map is set to arrive “in a future season.” That location is none other than launch map <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-4/Golmud_Railway"><u>Golmud Railway</u></a>, which, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-map-debate-reaches-new-level-as-players-meticulously-measure-70-maps-from-bf3-bf2042-and-more"><u>a few dedicated Reddit users let us know last year</u></a>, stands as not only one of the larger Battlefield 4 maps but one of the bigger Battlefield maps ever.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It is worth noting that Battlefield 6 has brought back maps before, with Operation Firestorm launching alongside the game itself in October. The wide-open desert area featured in the latest installment is actually a smaller version of the same map from Battlefield 3, so it’s unclear if Golmud Railway will receive the same treatment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, BF Studios says this fully rebuilt version of the Battlefield 4 map will be the biggest Battlefield 6 multiplayer map yet, promising to “preserve what made the map so memorable in Battlefield 4, particularly its combined arms gameplay, while improving how it plays and supports Battlefield 6 systems.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re bringing Golmud into Battlefield Labs early as this will be a multi-session project,” the developer says. “Through Labs, we want to test changes such as larger flight space, increased cover for aircraft, and other adjustments as the map evolves over time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of a recent tweak to jet gameplay, fans of air combat have also been hoping to see more love in Battlefield 6. To help meet their desires, BF Studios used the Labs post to confirm upcoming tests will include the rumored return of the AH-6 Little Bird.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect to see the compact helicopter back in Season 2 at an unspecified point in time, with things like the previously promised air radar also set for Labs testing soon. Also still in the cards is a solo queue for REDSEC battle royale, though BF Studios says the long-desired option is continuing as “internal and exploratory” testing. There’s no word on when the mode could come to Labs or if it will ever make its way to the public version of Battlefield 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield global community manager Kevin Johnson <a href="https://x.com/T0TALfps/status/2014006687280091437?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>took to X/Twitter</u></a> with more information about how BF Studios will continue to roll out testing for new content. Much of what was detailed today has no firm release date, but Labs players can go hands-on with at least some of the new content, including Contaminated, “as soon as this Friday.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Battlefield (@Battlefield) <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/2011106206014685329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 13, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Alongside that, we want to ensure more ongoing and meaningful action is taken on your feedback - Battlefield Labs will be the conduit for that,” Johnson said. “Things may take time, and we appreciate your patience, but what is in store is going to be a great collaboration moment!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched October 10, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. It’s found itself in a bit of a bind heading into 2026, with players taking to social media to beg for new content as BF Studios works to deliver its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-to-february-as-ea-tackles-community-feedback-with-an-extended-season-1"><u>delayed Season 2 come February 17</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

The hook is that your mech is your deck, meaning you can swap out parts as desired using your cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More intriguingly, Turtle Juice says that "every card played is immediately replaced, forcing players to think ahead, position cards strategically, and chain pilot abilities to forge mech-pilot synergies and unleash attack combos that can turn the tide of battle." Lead designer Ernani Rocha said, “With MECHBORN, we wanted to rethink what moment-to-moment strategy feels like in a roguelike deckbuilder. The conveyor-belt card system fundamentally changes how players plan, adapt, and position themselves every turn.” Check out the reveal trailer above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MECHBORN - First Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are 12 mech pilots with unique skills and backgrounds, allowing you to create all kinds of builds during your runs.

            <guid>1412284</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 will be pitting two space marine chapters – the Blood Ravens and the Dark Angels – against the terrifying Necrons, with an assist from their cyborg compatriots in the Adeptus Mechanicus. But while they all brood and scheme and recite litanies, the Orks will be literally crash-landing into the middle of it all in search of good fights and making gory memories. We got to try out a swathe of units and new campaign mechanics, and if there's one idea that seems to define the faction in this new RTS, it's this: "Make it bigger!"</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The WAAAGH!</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Orks wouldn't really be the Orks without the Waaagh! mechanic, representing their entire culture and warfare ethos of enthusiastic mayhem. It's been represented in various ways across many 40K games, but in Dawn of War 4, it's about as straightforward as the Orks themselves. Waaagh! is a bar that fills up from having lots of units on the field and, of course, from killing lots of humies and Necrons. Or even other Orks! Filling the bar will unlock tactical abilities, but also higher-tier units and upgrades.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 – Ork Faction Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Orks are very much a snowball faction, King Art Games told us. You kind of want to throw everything at the wall, sometimes literally, and let that chaos fuel your war machine. An Ork boy who's not mixing it up with the enemy is one who isn't earning his keep. And Ork units tend to be pretty cheap to replace, so you might as well box select them and send them to the front if they're just standing around.</p><p>Waaagh! is a bar that fills up from having lots of units on the field and, of course, from killing lots of humies and Necrons.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ork squads gain veterancy pretty quick, so even losing experienced squads isn't the end of the world. They're usually not as potent on a one-for-one basis as a fully veteran Space Marine squad, but they can reach peak performance sooner. And one of my favorite parts of the whole faction is that some of the Orks have veterancy upgrades that actually add more models to a squad. So a fresh batch of Boyz might only consist of a handful, but once the Waaagh! really gets rolling, it'll look like a proper horde.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When you have enough violent fervor saved up, you can Unleash the Waaagh!, which gives all of your units a frantic offensive power increase for a limited time.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Scrap 'em!</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Ork buildings are very much an extension of this playstyle. They're relatively cheap and fast to construct, any Ork unit can build them, and every single one has some kind of little grot with a machine gun on it at least. There are no zoning laws here. Even Ork grocery stores and kindergartens are designed to be defensive turrets, apparently. So basically, you want to more or less barf buildings out across the entire map as you advance. Most of them aren't very durable, but if your opponent has to navigate through a valley of scrap piles that are all shooting at them, that's going to wear them down at the very least.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The core of an Ork army is still the melee Slugga Boyz and the ranged Shoota Boyz, filling out the front with durable but mostly expendable troops that want to outnumber the enemy if possible. When I really needed to hold the line, though, I opted for Beast Snagga Boyz, an even meaner, and slightly more expensive, melee option who can be equipped with mid-range shotguns. I guess you could think of these as the unhinged hillbillies to the Sluggas' rowdy football hooligans.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The key to a lot of my Orky triumphs, though, actually turned out to be cavalry. Squighog Boyz charge into the fight on the backs of terrifying, sharp-toothed squighogs that are great at finding an opening in an Imperial Guard defensive line. And once they're stuck into the trenches, well, those poor humies don't stand much of a chance. For a faction that is best known for mass frontal assaults, I quite enjoyed the more tactical playstyle that these mounted boyz enable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Wurrboys add a caster option to the roster, while extra-expendable Gretchen and the slightly bulkier Mekboy keep your smoke-belching war machines in working order. The Stormboyz are another option for dealing with hardened defenses, using what is really more of a rocket with some straps on it than a proper jetpack to leap over the top of bunkers and sandbags.</p><p>It would be hard to imagine Dawn of War without the Orks.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of other, more specialized tools in the Ork arsenal, too. Flash Gitz are great at punching through the armor on hapless Space Marines or the various vehicles and mechanical monstrosities the other factions field. The stompy Deff Dread can mix it up with melee superunits that would tear the average ork to shreds. And when you really just need to make a hole in something at whatever cost, Bomb Squigs seem more than happy to sacrifice themselves to take out harder targets and enemy structures.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Orks have never been my main faction in 40K, but it would be hard to imagine Dawn of War without them. They love a challenge, and rejoice in the idea of finding the biggest and strongest foes to test their mettle against, and I can respect that. And I had a lot of fun messing around with them, even if they won't be my first choice on your average day. Especially seeing my squads of Boyz swell in numbers as they levelled up felt thematically appropriate and fantastically satisfying.And of course, we can't forget the centerpiece of every Ork incursion: the Warboss. Dawn of War 4 has two of them, actually, with fairly different playstyles and campaign goals. You can learn more about them in our hands-on Ork campaign preview coming later in the month. Until then, you can get a look at the boyz in all their glory in the Ork faction CGI trailer, and learn more about the development of Dawn of War 4 with our developer interviews, all part of this month's IGN First.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-4-hands-on-deep-dive-with-the-ork-faction-ign-first]]></content:encoded>

Two Ubisoft studios will be closed completely as a result of the changes, while others are subject to further layoffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the half dozen games that have been fully scrapped, Ubisoft is only publicly naming one today — its long-awaited Sands of Time remake that was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prince-of-persia-remake-ubisoft-montreal">rebooted once already</a>. Three of the canceled games were new IPs, while one was a mobile game. Ubisoft's core focus going forward, the company has said, will be on open-world games and live-services.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No specific detail has been given of the seven titles that Ubisoft has delayed, either, though this number does include the unannounced game once set for launch before March 31 that is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake">widely expected to be the company's Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remaster</a>. This will now launch in the coming financial year — so before March 31, 2027.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft Stockholm will fully close as a result of the changes, having previously collaborated on Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, alongside mobile studio Ubisoft Halifax (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shuts-down-assassins-creed-rebellion-developer-halifax-studio-just-weeks-after-it-unionized">news of which first broke last week</a>). "Restructurings" have also taken place at Ubisoft offices in Abu Dhabi, at Trials studio RedLynx and at Massive, home to The Division. In addition, all teams will be required to return to in-office working five days a week, albeit with an annual allowance of remote-working days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We went through a thorough review of projects across December [and] January, with the current market evolution in mind — which is consistently more selective," Ubisoft's chief financial officer Frederick Duguet told IGN today. "You've seen the last quarter showing a never-before-seen level of competition. Competition and selection is here to stay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When you are coming in number one, number two, with great content quality in a given segment, then you can have a very strong reward in terms of player reception and financial performance. That's what really informed our pipeline review. We selected what would be the best projects to put the Creative Houses in the best position to succeed in that market."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a sign of how vast an impact Ubisoft expects this restructure to have, as well as how badly it feels it is needed, the company has scrapped its previous guidance for the full financial year and now expects net bookings of around €1.5 billion ($1.75 billion), down by €330 million ($386 million).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Via a statement shared with IGN, Ubisoft said this huge reduction reflected changes to the company's upcoming release pipeline following the implementation of its updated development roadmap, and the decision to "postpone negations on certain partnerships" in the context of its new operating model.</p><p>"Competition is here to stay..."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, the shakeup comes as Ubisoft finally lays out how its global development might is to be split into five "Creative Houses" that will operate as independent business units — the first of which was detailed last year. The previously-established Vantage Studios now encompasses the development of Ubisoft's three biggest brands (Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six) and soon the remaining divisions will take on themed groups that cover the company's remaining franchises.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative House 2 will be dedicated to shooters, and look after The Division, Ghost Recon, and Splinter Cell. Creative House 3 will focus on live experiences, including For Honor, The Crew, Riders Republic, Brawlhalla, and Skull &amp; Bones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative House 4 will feature narrative driven and fantasy-orientated series including Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, and Beyond Good &amp; Evil (yes, seemingly Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 still lives). Finally, Creative House 5 will center on family and casual gaming, including Just Dance, Uno, Hasbro, Idle Miner Tycoon, Ketchapp, Hungry Shark, and Invincible: Guarding the Globe.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Prince of Persia: The Complete Playlist</h3><p>Here's the entire Prince of Persia gameography, from Mechner/Broderbund's original to Ubisoft's many sequels.
