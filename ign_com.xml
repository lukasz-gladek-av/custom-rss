While this could just be a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wizards-of-the-coast-says-no-truth-to-rumors-that-magic-the-gatherings-spider-man-crossover-will-only-get-one-print-run">fairly limited preorder allocation</a> and more will come later, we’ve been seeing some eye-wateringly gigantic markups on the secondary market in the build-up to launch (September 26).</p><div catalogid="5f900a08-75a3-42a4-b812-6847123c4fb5" id="216020"><div id="216020" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Marvel's Spider-Man - Collector Booster Box (12 Packs)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, just a single Collector Booster is listed at a "Market Price" of <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OPZ4?object_uuid=6a3833de-741e-47e5-ad20-b1077e9febcc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$88 at the trusted resale site TCGPlayer</a>. <strong>This </strong><em><strong>only </strong></em><strong>contains 15 cards. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Play Booster Boxes (including 12 packs) aren't much better, <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xq05?object_uuid=6a3833de-741e-47e5-ad20-b1077e9febcc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reaching close to $1000</a> on the resale market right now, so buying in bulk isn’t exactly economical either. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So, what's the big deal, and why are Spider-Man Collector Boosters flipping for so much already?</strong> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a mix of a few factors. Collector packs are supposedly a shortcut to the coolest, most valuable cards in a set. 11 to 13 of them are Traditional Foil cards, but there are still 5 commons, 4 uncommons, and 5 rare or higher, with a ‘Headliner Mythic’ in around 1% of boosters.</p></div><div catalogid="5f900a08-75a3-42a4-b812-6847123c4fb5" id="216021"><div id="216021" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Marvel's Spider-Man - Collector Booster (1 Pack of 15 Cards)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With cards like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAnMY?object_uuid=6a3833de-741e-47e5-ad20-b1077e9febcc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">borderless Soul Stone already sitting at around $475 resale</a>, there’s no shortage of chase cards in the Spider-Man MTG crossover, though prices will likely shift once the Universes Beyond set fully lands. The catch is most of those big pulls will generally be locked behind Collector Boosters, which, as we have discussed, aren’t exactly cheap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combine that with Magic riding an all-time high after Final Fantasy and Edge of Eternities, the hype of its first major Marvel crossover starring Spider-Man, and demand easily outpacing supply, and those boosters might as well be worth their weight in cardboard… or gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But just like the Collector Boosters, every other preorder for the upcoming Spidey set is sold out. That includes the Gift Bundle, Booster Bundle, Scene Box, and Prerelease Pack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want those before launch, your best bet is still the secondary market at trusted resale sites like, as we've mentioned, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObml7?object_uuid=6a3833de-741e-47e5-ad20-b1077e9febcc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGPlayer</a>. The only thing left available to traditionally preorder is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-spider-man-booster-set-is-back-in-stock-at-amazon-today">Play Booster Box at Amazon</a> for $209.70. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also the Welcome Decks (around <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBg7NJ?object_uuid=6a3833de-741e-47e5-ad20-b1077e9febcc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$30-$50 each</a> right now) that became available at the 2025 San Diego Comic Con that ran at the end of July, with another wave of these "expected to become available closer to release later in September".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remarkably, this is par for the course for the Universe Beyond Collector Boosters this year, with single <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRlrK?object_uuid=6a3833de-741e-47e5-ad20-b1077e9febcc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy Booster Packs selling for over $130</a>, and the Booster Box Display sitting at around <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OeLL?object_uuid=6a3833de-741e-47e5-ad20-b1077e9febcc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$1,400 as well</a> (yikes).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Again, little shadow?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight: Silksong is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">coming out in less than two weeks</a>, and you know what that means, right? Yup, that means it's time to play (or replay) the original Hollow Knight! Which is exactly what a lot of folks are doing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight, released on PC in 2017, has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/#48h" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached an all-time high concurrent player count today on Steam (per SteamDB)</a>, eight years after release, almost certainly due to the Silksong news. At the time this piece is being written, it's sitting at 23,840 concurrent players, an all-time peak.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Prior to this, concurrent player counts have been sitting roughly around 10,000 for months on end, usually a bit below. But after the Silksong news yesterday, they began climbing, reaching 16k yesterday afternoon and dipping slightly overnight before shooting up again today in a playercount that seems poised to climb even higher throughout the day and into the weekend. The previous all-time high was over 20k players in 2022.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is likely due to a surge of players running to replay Hollow Knight, or play it for the first time, ahead of the release of Silksong on September 4. There has been no shortage of interest in Team Cherry's standout Metroidvania in the years since its launch, as we now know it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-reaches-15-million-copies-sold">sold 15 million copies</a> across all platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, looks to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-looks-to-be-significantly-bigger-than-the-original-hollow-knight">even bigger than the base game of Hollow Knight</a> if the trailer shown yesterday is any indication, and it sounds like there's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/team-cherry-says-it-has-plans-for-more-silksong-content-for-months-and-years-to-come">even more Silksong to come after launch</a>. We got to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-we-played-it-gamescom-2025">play a little bit of Silksong at gamescom this past week</a>, with our previewer saying it "shows little sign of disappointing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
