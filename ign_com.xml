            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-skips-ps5-release-in-japan-due-to-platform-policies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has announced via <a href="https://news.xbox.com/ja-jp/2025/06/09/gears-of-war-reloaded-pre-order-beta-xbox-games-showcase/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Xbox Live Japan</u></a> that the remaster of the first Gears of War game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/gears-of-war-reloaded">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>, will not get a Japanese PS5 release. However, the title will still come to Xbox Series X and S, Xbox PC, Game Pass, and PC via Steam in Japan this August.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Microsoft, Gears of War: Reloaded, due out August 26, 2025, will not be sold for PS5 in the country due to “regional rating restrictions” and “platform policies.” The “regional rating restrictions” explanation refers to the classification standards laid out by CERO, Japan’s game rating board. Although it has not been officially announced exactly what aspect of Gears of War: Reloaded failed to pass the board, it is highly likely that violence and gore was the issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Gears of War series features chainsaw weapons that allow you to bloodily slice your way through enemies. “Mutilation/body-cutting” is one of the categories of violent expression highlighted on <a href="https://www.cero.gr.jp/en/publics/index/17/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>CERO’s official website</u></a>. The ratings board has historically had a strict approach towards depictions of limb severance — The Callisto Protocol and the 2023 Dead Space remake are two examples of games that were banned on consoles in Japan due to this.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So why is Gears of War: Reloaded coming to other platforms in Japan, but not PS5? If a game is refused CERO classification, developers can either make suggested cuts and apply for re-rating from CERO, or they can try to obtain a classification from the <a href="https://www.globalratings.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>IARC</u></a> (International Age Rating Coalition) instead. However, all games with 18+ content in Japan must pass CERO’s board in order to be sold on the PlayStation Store (source: <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/20220310-194938/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>) — this is likely the “platform policies” that the announcement refers to. The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/ja-jp/games/store/gears-of-war-reloaded-pre-order/9nz7kclz1sx1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Japanese Microsoft Store page</u></a> for Gears of War: Reloaded shows an IARC 18+ rating, with no CERO certificate listed. This suggests that Microsoft decided to go with IARC after the title failed to obtain a CERO Z (18+) classification.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Xbox 360 version of Gears of War had its <a href="https://jp.ign.com/gears-of-war-reloaded/79743/news/gears-of-warps5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>violence censored in Japan</u></a>, with the severed limbs being blacked out. At the time of writing, it is not known whether Gears of War: Reloaded will be censored in Japan or not.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A new trailer for Gears of War: Reloaded was shown during Microsoft's Xbox Games Showcase in June 2025.
