            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A Pocketpair developer has issued a response after some Pokémon fans questioned the timing of the company's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld-palfarm">Palworld: Palfarm</a> announcement, which came just a week after Nintendo revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Japanese company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-devs-announce-farming-sim-spin-off-palworld-palfarm">Pocketpair announced cozy farming sim spinoff Palworld: Palfarm</a> for PC just a week after Nintendo announced fellow cozy farming sim spinoff Pokémon Pokopia for Switch 2 during its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-september-2025-live-updates-everything-announced">Nintendo Direct showcase</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Pocketpair, in Palworld: Palfarm you work alongside Pals to turn fields into full-functioning farms solo or in online multiplayer. “Delegate duties to plant seeds, tend to growing plants, and round up the harvest,” Pocketpair said. “Befriend the locals and unearth unexpected story arcs. Beware, the coziness can turn chaotic — watch out for wild Pals that pilfer fresh produce.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Pokopia, meanwhile, due out on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026, is described as a life simulation game “where players can create their own Pokémon paradise.” The game features Ditto as its protagonist, who has transformed to look like a human. “As Ditto, players can explore and learn moves from the Pokémon they befriend — such as Bulbasaur’s Leafage to grow greenery, or Squirtle’s Water Gun to revive dried-up plants — expanding their capabilities and helping them create an inviting environment to attract a variety of Pokémon,” Nintendo explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Players can collect materials, build furniture, grow vegetables, and create homes for Pokémon, allowing them to experience a cozy, slow life with Pokémon — one that they build themselves from the ground up. Over time, players can develop a town of their own and invite other players or Pokémon to visit. Pokémon Pokopia also features a day-night cycle linked to real-world time, changing weather, and in-game locations with their own unique characteristics.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some were quick to question the timing of Palworld: Palfarm's announcement, despite the fact games take years to make and reveals are planned long in advance. "The timing of this just after the Pokémon Pokopia announcement. They got balls, I respect that," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1no4cdy/comment/nfp5yek/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Sweaty_Molasses_3899</a>. "They probably felt they needed to announce this earlier than they might have wanted simply to get ahead of accusations of 'copying' their idea for a farm-sim game after Pokopia got announced," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1no4cdy/comment/nfqrc9d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested KJShen</a>. "I feel like this announcement is to spite Nintendo for their recent bs," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/harvestmoon/comments/1noik0j/comment/nfrw07k/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added Brohtworst</a>. "Can't be a coincidence they'd develop something so similar to Pokopia." "It's so uninspired to make a game that's more about one upping a company than actually making something good," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/harvestmoon/comments/1noik0j/comment/nfs0chq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared stcrIight</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Pocketpair communications director and publishing manager John “Bucky” Buckley, who has become the face of the company for western fans, <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1970691367224648131" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has issued a response on social media</a>, saying “the tinfoil hats are out in force.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A certain % of silliness and grumpy people were expected when announcing Palfarm, and a smaller % of "REEEE POCKETPAIR" was expected too…” Bucky said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But I'm surprised how many people think we're wizard-level developers able to make a game in one week. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The tinfoil hats are out in force😇”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then: “There is a certain level of poetic irony… the same people who "REEE POCKETPAIR" are the same people thinking we made an entire game in one week. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Schrödinger's Pocketpair I guess. We are both a ‘slop company’ and capable of making entire games in one week it seems🤷‍♂️”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is of course a reference to the copying accusations Palworld itself suffered following its explosive launch early in 2024. Fans dubbed the game ‘Pokémon with guns’ due to similarities between some of the mechanics. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company eventually sued Pocketpair in a patent case that is still ongoing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-companys-patent-lawsuit-rumbles-on-pocketpair-says-its-heads-down-getting-palworld-ready-to-exit-early-access-and-officially-release-ver-10-in-2026">Pocketpair said it was heads down getting <u>Palworld</u> ready to leave early access and officially release its 1.0 update at some point in 2026</a>. Palworld will launch proper next year alongside what sounds like a huge update, which Pocketpair is now focusing on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the while, Nintendo has been busy obtaining patents — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-should-never-have-received-controversial-summon-character-and-let-it-fight-pokmon-patent-ip-lawyers-say"><u>some of which IP lawyers said should never have been granted</u></a> — as it develops its case against Pocketpair, which has vowed to defend itself in court.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case involves <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>three patents</u></a> granted by the Japan Patent Office: two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters. All three patents were filed in 2024, after Palworld came out. However, they are actually derived from earlier Nintendo patents dating from 2021. In other words, it seems that once Palworld came on the scene, Nintendo filed divisional patents that were geared to fight specifically against Palworld’s alleged infringement of the original patents.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo's lawyers trying to figure out if this breaches a future patent they're working on <a href="https://t.co/gRHF6UZj9x" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/gRHF6UZj9x</a></p>— Adam Vjestica (@ItsMrProducts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsMrProducts/status/1970418841391112698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>has made changes</u></a> to Palworld’s disputed mechanics. The November 2024 patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pokéball-like Pal Spheres (now Pals just materialize next to you when summoned). In May this year, another Palworld update changed how you can glide in the game — instead of directly grabbing onto Glider Pals, now you just simply use Pal-buffed Glider equipment. Then, in July, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rewrites-patent-mid-case-in-ongoing-lawsuit-against-palworld-dev-pocketpair-but-why"><u>reworded one of the patents in the case</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At GDC in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood"><u>IGN sat down for an extended conversation with Bucky</u></a> following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals. He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Overnight, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio director and executive producer Masayoshi Yokoyama introduced RGG Direct 2025, a livestream chiefly dedicated to a remake of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-kiwami-3-seemingly-on-the-way-after-fans-spot-alleged-rgg-website-leak">previously leaked</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3,</a> which will be released alongside the spin-off game, Dark Ties.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yakuza 3 was released in 2009 — that's over 15(!) years ago now — and Yokoyama said this remake "is the best iteration of the original game, Yakuza Kiwami 3." Dark Ties, however, is a "new, never-before-seen story," which means this essentially bundles two games in one package.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Like a Dragon &amp; Yakuza series will celebrate its 20th anniversary on December 8 of this year," the team said. "We sincerely appreciate your continued support of RGG Studio."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/screenshot-2025-09-24-at-11-18-48-1758709258747.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're developing [Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties] based on the concept 'a legend is reborn and a new legacy begins,'" Yokoyama added, after which chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto said that both Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza Kiwami 2 "directly link to this title." Producer/director Ryosuke Horii introduced details about the upcoming game, which is out in February 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[Kiwami 3] is a total remake of 2009's Yakuza 3," he explained. "We've rebuilt it from the ground up using the latest technology developed by our talented staff. The game has evolved enormously with loads of new cutscenes and newly added game elements. I can proudly say that we're delivering a game worthy of the Kiwami title."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We had a good time with the original, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/03/09/yakuza-3-review"><u>awarding it 8.5/10 back in 2010</u></a>, but while the remake follows Yakuza 3's story, RGG has added cutscenes "that we weren't able to fully deliver before."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Whether it's Kiryu and his pal Rikiya Shimabukuro, or enemies like Mine, Kanda, and Hamazaki, we've further detailed their thoughts and actions to better depict the human condition and connection," Horii added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additional scenes are not the only new things coming to the game, either. Players can expect re-recorded voice lines as well as brand new ones, and "overhauled" animations, with some scenes "changed drastically with different developments and outcomes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In order to greatly outdo ourselves and make a game that everyone will love, we didn't take the safe, defensive route by glorifying the past with a simple remake, but instead took a more aggressive approach to make Yakuza Kiwami 3," Horii said.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">🐉A LEGEND IS REBORN AND A NEW LEGACY BEGINS🐉<br>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties releases Feb 12, 2026 on PlayStation®5, PlayStation®4, Nintendo Switch™ 2, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (Steam).<br>👉Digital pre-orders now live (link in bio)!

It's a story of the "gritty reality of human relationships in the criminal underworld," with a "refined but cool" combat style centered around boxing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties are out on February 12, 2026.
