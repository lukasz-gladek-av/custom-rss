            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/streamer-secures-full-combo-for-the-most-infamous-guitar-hero-song-at-200-speed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Clone Hero streamer and content creator CarnyJared has completed a full combo (FC) for DragonForce’s infamous <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/guitar-hero-iii-legends-of-rock"><u>Guitar Hero 3</u></a> song Through the Fire and Flames — at 200% speed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The streamer's description of the event says it all: “IT. IS. OVER.” Posted yesterday, February 27, is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhV9b0CiAtU&amp;t=5s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recorded evidence</a> of the unbelievable feat and world record CarnyJared managed to pull off while streaming. As he launches into his final, successful attempt at hitting all 3,722 notes without missing a beat, on-screen text reminds viewers that this grand finale is the result of nine months of practicing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I am rightfully thankful for everybody that has supported me throughout this ridiculous grind. I have the best supporters on the entire platform of Twitch and YouTube,” CarnyJared explains in the video’s description.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We all spent an unfathomable amount of time staring at the same 3,722 notes, figuring out any possible way to hit them more efficiently. Somehow it worked out, and somehow I am able to sit in front of this computer which you have all cumulatively provided to me, and make a living playing Clone Hero.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— CarnyJared (@CarnyJared) <a href="https://twitter.com/CarnyJared/status/1895007995852951808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Through the Fire and Flames running at regular speed can be a lot to process for the untrained eye, so watching CarnyJared blaze through the song at 200% speed feels completely incomprehensible. There’s not much else to say; FCing a seven-and-a-half-minute song in just over three minutes is extremely impressive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Achieving an FC on the open-source Guitar Hero-like known as Clone Hero requires playing a song in its entirety without missing a single note. On-screen stats in the streamer’s video reveal that he’s reached nearly 2,000 FC runs past the song's first bridge, only 662 past its second bridge, and 227 to its solo section. The Through the Fire and Flames 200% FC you see today marks only the fourth time CarnyJared has managed to pass the solo.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is a moment that will live with me forever.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“I am blessed every single day to wake up and have food in the kitchen, and a place to sleep because of you amazing group of people,” CarnyJared adds. “And I also thank my family, who has not only supported me my whole life, but they all specifically watched and supported this entire grind at my lowest and highest points. This is a moment that will live with me forever.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He called the Through the Fire and Flames 200% FC the “hardest thing” he’s ever done in his life, so the celebration that follows his successful run tracks with the effort he’s put into completing it throughout the last nine months. For those interested in seeing how such an inhuman achievement can be accomplished in the world of Guitar Hero and Clone Hero, CarnyJared teased that fans can expect a “1 hour+” documentary in the next few months.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CarnyJared?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#CarnyJared</a> CarnyJared full combos Through The Fire and Flames on 200% speed <a href="https://t.co/bscIumlvhy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/bscIumlvhy</a></p>— Livestream Fails (@LSF_Forwarder) <a href="https://twitter.com/LSF_Forwarder/status/1895045223983591471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">For more on how the Guitar Hero community is keeping the game alive, you can watch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crkd-reveals-its-new-guitar-controller-and-how-it-builds-on-guitar-heros-legacy-ign-fan-fest-2025"><u>music game streamer Acai test out CRKD’s new guitar controller</u></a> in Fortnite Festival as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/fanfest">IGN Fan Fest 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-charges-for-character-edit-vouchers-again-and-players-are-frustrated<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is out and millions of players are making their hunters. It might be worth spending some extra time in the character creator though, as frequent extensive edits can run up a tab.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Character Edit Vouchers make a return in Monster Hunter Wilds (as pointed out by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/monster-hunter-wilds-locks-character-editing-behind-microtransactions/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a>), adding a microtransaction for returning to the creator screen. While smaller edits to your character — say, hair color or voice pitch — won't consume a voucher, more extensive edits <em>will </em>require a voucher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You can edit hair, eyebrow color, facial hair, makeup and clothing from the Appearance Menu in tent without using a voucher," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3289620/Monster_Hunter_Wilds__Character_Edit_Voucher_ThreeVoucher_Pack/?curator_clanid=44795648" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">description on the Steam page states</a>. More extensive edits, anywhere from changing the actual voice to swapping from a male to female hunter, will however eat up one voucher.</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom is handing out one free voucher for players, but anything beyond that will require purchasing a new one. The same rules apply to your Palico, which will also need a voucher for any extensive edits. The vouchers are sold in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">various denominations</a>, including three-packs for character edits at $6.99 and a bundled Character &amp; Palico Edit Voucher three-pack for $9.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that this is not the first time Monster Hunter has had this particular microtransaction. Both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/861870/Monster_Hunter_World__Character_Edit_Voucher_Single_Voucher/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monster Hunter World</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1798007/MONSTER_HUNTER_RISE__One_Character_Edit_Voucher/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monster Hunter Rise</a> had their own Character Edit Vouchers. That's not to say they're a particularly beloved facet of the series, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/s42q17/character_edit_vouchers_are_a_total_scam_and/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monster Hunter subreddit thread from three years ago</a> lamented the Vouchers in Monster Hunter Rise, for example. "Worst part of gen 5 for sure," one user replied at the time. "I hate the introduction of completely unnecessary [microtransactions]."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even in the days leading up to Monster Hunter Wilds' launch, players voiced disdain for this system. As <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1it8xfg/probably_no_one_cares_but_capcom_for_the_love_of/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some in a recent thread noted</a>, other games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> offer character edits for free, and an unlimited amount. With Capcom's current system, there's a hard cap to how many times a player can return to the creator and edit their hunter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"On top of having to pay in MH, there's a hard limit where you can never customise that character again once you've used all the available vouchers. What purpose does this serve?" <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1it8xfg/probably_no_one_cares_but_capcom_for_the_love_of/mdmvmju/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one player asked</a>. "When I return to a game I haven't played for a while I like to change my character's looks to keep it fresh, but I just don't bother in Monster Hunter and whack a helmet on lmao."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The system itself is fairly reminiscent of some MMOs where making a "new character" might require an additional sub or added cost. Yet the Voucher system has been a routine point of frustration, to the point that some PC players have found ways to get around it with mods.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">All Low Rank Armor in Monster Hunter Wilds</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Users also left negative feedback in the Steam reviews for Character Edit Vouchers for both Monster Hunter World and Rise. Even the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3289630/Monster_Hunter_Wilds__Character_Edit_Voucher_Single_Voucher_Free_Trial_Version/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Character Edit Voucher - Free Trial Version</a> for Monster Hunter Wilds has garnered nearly 200 reviews as of the time of writing, sitting at a "Mixed" overall rating. On the negative side, the complaints seem clear: "It's not ideal, but I can live with cosmetics 'DLC', but limiting character edits is a bit much, should be free and unlimited."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the rebuttal, the positive reviews stress how little the Vouchers impact the game itself: "The amount of people that will never actually read, or actually use the in-game feature that allows this shocks me. But then again, it's the internet here we're talking about."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The whole kerfuffle feels reminiscent of Dragon's Dogma 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-breaks-capcom-steam-records-amid-microtransactions-furore">where a legion of microtransactions rolled out at launch and immediately garnered frustration</a>. Those particular exchanges offered in-game goods; ones still acquireable through gameplay means, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-mods-undercut-capcoms-controversial-microtransactions-dish-out-infinite-save-slots">players still found ways to work around them anyways</a>. In the case of Monster Hunter Wilds, there's one free Edit Voucher, and everything after has to be bought out-of-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It remains to be seen how the community will react to this, long-term. Monster Hunter Wilds is only just now getting into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-nears-1-million-peak-concurrent-players-on-steam-and-its-only-going-to-get-bigger-from-here">many, many people's hands</a>, and I do think that other concerns like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review">difficulty</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-mixed-steam-user-review-rating-capcom-issues-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-troubleshooting-guide">PC performance</a> will take precedence over microtransactions, especially since these aren't a <em>new</em> problem. Whether they remain a problem, or players learn to live with — or work around — the Voucher limit, we'll see in the coming weeks and months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help get your Monster Hunter Wilds adventure started, take a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Things_Monster_Hunter_Wilds_Doesn%27t_Tell_You_-_Tips">what Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t tell you</a>, and a guide to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Weapons">all 14 weapon types</a> in the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fans-are-hoping-legends-z-a-will-bring-a-certain-elemental-monkey-trio-to-nintendo-switch-at-last<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A complete PokéDex at last.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday's Pokémon Legends: Z-A gameplay reveal flooded us with new information about the upcoming Pokémon games set in a futuristic Lumiose City, including looks at dozens of Pokémon we should expect to see there. But one trio of monsters that fans were really hoping to see did NOT appear: the elemental monkeys Panpour, Pansage, and Pansear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why are fans so hung up on the monkey trio? It's a bit complicated. The three monkeys and their evolutions have been a part of an increasingly shrinking list of Pokémon that are currently unavailable in any Nintendo Switch game. If you want to truly catch 'em all, you still can, by transferring them from other Pokémon games pre-Switch to Pokémon Home. But at the moment, the following Pokémon are unavailable for capture natively in any Nintendo Switch Pokémon game:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Panpour</li><li>Pansage</li><li>Pansear</li><li>Simipour</li><li>Simisage</li><li>Simisear</li><li>Patrat</li><li>Watchog</li><li>Furfrou</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">This list used to be much longer, but Game Freak added a ton of new Pokémon in the DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet that culled the list down to these nine. What's more, the trailer we saw yesterday showed both Patrat and Furfrou, confirming these two at least will be available in Legends: Arceus. And since Watchog evolves from Patrat, it's a safe bet it will be in the game too. So that just leaves the three monkeys.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The elemental monkey trio was first introduced in Pokémon Black and White, and are somewhat beloved by fans due to the unique way the player obtains them. In Black and White, the first Gym the player encounters will use a typing that the player's starter Pokémon is weak against. However, if the player visits a certain person in the Dreamyard, they'll receive the monkey that has an advantage against that Gym, making it easier to tackle. Their designs are also memorable for being based on the "Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil" wise monkeys of Japanese folklore.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/28/pokmon-legends-z-a-releases-in-late-2025-3-1740761188956.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Furfrou lets out a lakeside howl in Pokemon Legends Z-A.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Realistically, the odds of the monkey trio showing up in Legends: Z-A are actually pretty good. It would be very surprising for Game Freak to leave them out of what could possibly be the last major Pokémon game on Nintendo Switch, and given that they appeared in the Kalos region PokéDex back in the day, it only makes sense for them to still be there in Z-A.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if the monkeys are included, there's still one other problem Game Freak needs to solve: Spinda. Spinda is catchable on Nintendo Switch in Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl, but due to an error in how the game reads its spot patterns, it cannot be transferred to Pokémon Home. You can still get a Spinda from pre-Switch games transferred to Home, but the weird stuck nature of Spindas on Switch means that the dizzy little bear could probably use a functional Z-A appearance too, if Game Freak feels amenable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-first-trailer-reveals-rooftop-running-gameplay-and-late-2025-release-window">first real look at Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> gave us a lot to take in, and we're still dissecting the footage to find all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fans-are-frantically-trying-to-work-out-how-pokemon-legends-z-a-connects-to-other-pokemon-games">connections between this and other, past Pokémon games</a>.

But it also outlined several awaited features it’ll bring:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Update 7.0:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>One Chapter Pack</li><li>One Champion Pack</li><li>Private PvP lobbies</li><li>A new weapon (only in PvE for now)</li><li>New Operation</li><li>Weapon perks rebalance</li><li>Class weapon loadouts rework</li><li>PvE Prestige Rank</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The PvE Prestige Rank is perhaps of most interest to veteran players of Space Marine 2 looking for a new challenge or goal to work towards. Here’s how it works: once you reach level 25 on a class, you can buy a Prestige Level that will unlock a unique Prestige Perk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Choose them wisely,” Focus and Saber said, “because you won’t be able to change your selected Prestige Perks before unlocking the four Prestige Levels.” On top of that power boost, each class will have a unique cosmetic reward that emphasizes the class’ iconic armour part.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 will get Public Test Servers (PTS) on Steam only in March before Patch 7 comes out. This will give fans early access to the upcoming features and the chance to share feedback so the developers can refine the content ahead of launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Focus and Saber teased the upcoming launch of Horde mode, a feature Space Marine 2 players have been looking forward to ever since the game came out last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You’re very eager to get more info on the Horde Mode, it’s one of our top priorities right now,” Focus and Saber said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One thing we can say is that it will be very different from the Space Marine 1 Horde Mode, and that there are surprises we can’t wait for you to find out about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Once we get really interesting things to show you about it, we will do it!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bear with us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same post, Focus and Saber also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-stamps-out-live-service-game-talk-amid-backlash-to-fomo-community-events">stamped out live service game talk amid a backlash to 'FOMO' Community Events</a>.
