Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Picked by</strong>: IGN Deals Team</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To nobody's surprise, we have to recommend the Switch 2, especially the Mario Kart World bundle. We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World an 8 out of 10</a> in our review, with Logan Plant saying, “Mario Kart World may not make the most convincing case that going open-world was the boost the series needed, but excellent multiplayer racing, incredible polish, and the thrilling new Knockout Tour mode still more than live up to its legacy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 has been flying off shelves despite a lack of Black Friday deals, and then even more so after retailers finally dropped the price by $50 off and on during Cyber Week. There are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/All_Switch_2_Bundles">more Switch 2 bundles</a> still available that include everything from microSD Express cards to other games.

But it also meant we didn’t get a lot of “crazy toy maker” experiments, like alarm clocks, cardboard backpacks, or micro-sized consoles. Which is why my pick for the perfect Nintendo fan gift this year isn’t exactly something truly new: it’s the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/metroid-prime-4-beyond/Amiibo_Functionality,_Rewards,_and_Unlocks">Metroid Prime 4 amiibo</a> triple threat of Samus herself, Samus &amp; Vi-O-La, and bounty hunter Sylux. Metallic paint amiibo are often some of the best – and I’m really liking the more aggressive stance of the standalone Samus and her shiny-red new suit and motorbike combo. Sylux himself looks a bit like an evil, blue Masterchief, rocking his trademark shoulder spikes. </p></div><div id="233483" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>amiibo Samus &amp; Vi-O-La - Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Series</h3></p></div><div catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287" id="233485"><div id="233485" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>amiibo Sylux Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Series</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The two Metroid amiibo are available now and Sylux is out now (as of December 4).</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>3. Switch 2 Pro Controller</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Picked by</strong>: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/mrhurgy">Logan Plant</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The S<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">witch 2 Pro Controller</a> might be the best controller Nintendo has ever produced, finally unseating the GameCube controller after more than 20 years on top. Its matte material feels fantastic in the hands (and somehow never gets grimy), the control sticks have a great level of tension, the ZL and ZR triggers fit your fingers perfectly, and the new GL and GR back buttons add extra flexibility to whatever game you’re playing. Plus, it has a headphone jack, which was easily the Switch 1 Pro Controller’s biggest weakness. And, it has fantastic battery life – I’ve only had to charge mine a handful of times since the Switch 2 launched in June. Sure, Switch 1 controllers work on Switch 2, but the hardcore Nintendo fan in your life deserves this massive upgrade.</p></div><div catalogid="09569512-2c92-4dd0-88a7-4eb7d80358a4" id="224941"><div id="224941" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>4. Alarmo Clock</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Picked by</strong>: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/sethgmacy">Seth Macy</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo">Alarmo</a> is an absolutely adorable throwback to Nintendo's roots as a toy maker, while also paying homage to its current success as a video game company. Characters of your choosing will watch over you while you sleep, and while that may sound creepy, it's not. They're actually collecting info on how well you're sleeping, and sharing it with you, because that's what friends do. Even if you don't use it for its intended alarm…o purposes, it's still an adorable time piece to keep on your desk. The screen is bright and crisp, and the dial on the top feels excellent to use and set. Best of all, they added Kirby with the most recent update, and who doesn't love Kirby? Don't answer that question, please. I don't want to know. </p></div><div catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287" id="233486"><div id="233486" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alarmo</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>5. Donkey Kong Bananza</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Picked by</strong>: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/mrhurgy">Logan Plant</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Simply put, this is <em>the </em>game to get for Nintendo Switch 2 this holiday season. We called Donkey Kong Bananza a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">10/10 masterpiece in our review</a> back in July, praising its destructible environments and incredible movement. It may not star Mario or Link, but this is a top-shelf first-party Nintendo game that got the Switch 2 generation off to a smashing start. It takes between 15 and 20 hours just to reach the credits, with dozens of more hours waiting for anyone that wants to see absolutely every banana tucked inside. If I were a kid, I can’t think of a game I’d have more fun with on Christmas morning than this one.</p></div><div catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287" id="233487"><div id="233487" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Donkey Kong Bananza</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>6. Game Boy LEGO Set</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Picked by</strong>: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/sethgmacy">Seth Macy</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since this was first announced, there's been a place inside my soul that needed it in my life. If you're the same, or know someone who is, this is probably the coolest, and most affordable, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-lego-nintendo-sets">Nintendo-themed LEGO set</a> going. Everything about the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-the-lego-game-boy-set-72046">LEGO Game Boy</a> is delightful, from the screens you can change out to reflect the game you want to show off, to the replica carts you build with it. It's roughly the same size as an actual Game Boy, too, and the buttons feel almost identical to the ones on the real deal. It only takes around an hour to put together, and then you have this super cool collectible to show off to everyone who asks, and even people who don't ask. Stop people on the street, get their opinion of it. Maybe you'll make a new friend, who knows?</p></div><div catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287" id="233488"><div id="233488" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Game Boy Set</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Game Boy...</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>7. Pokémon Legends: Z-A</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Picked by</strong>: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/jkienlen">Jacob Kienlen</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been a fan of Pokémon games since I first got my own copy of Pokémon Yellow Version on the Game Boy back in the 90s. I’ve played almost <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-games-in-order">every mainline entry in the series</a> since then, and I was super excited to start playing Pokémon Legends: Z-A when it launched this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN gave the game a solid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review"><u>8/10 review</u></a>, and I agree that it’s a great game overall. It takes bits and pieces of Legends: Arceus and Scarlet and Violet that brought new life to the series and flat out does those things better. The entire story takes place in a single location (Luminose City), which seems so small until the game starts to unfold and you meet new people and unlock new areas. It’s the urban Pokémon game I didn’t know I needed, and I’d recommend it to any fellow Pokéfan looking for their next obsession.</p></div><div catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287" id="233490"><div id="233490" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon™ Legends: Z-A</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>8. Analogue3D </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Picked by</strong>: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/sethgmacy">Seth Macy</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the ultimate Nintendo 64. Preorders sold out almost instantly when it was first announced way back, and the first restock has already come and gone. Maybe, just maybe, there'll be another one and you can grab it. Whoever gets one of these will be as happy as the original Nintendo 64 kid from the home video that springs up this time of year on social media.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't an emulator: it's a field-programmable gate array. What does that mean, exactly? Too complicated to get into now, but essentially this IS a Nintendo 64, it's not emulating it. It's an actual piece of futuristic technology that lets you play your N64 games on modern TVs in 4K. If you manage to score an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/analogue3d-review">Analogue3D</a> this year, you will be the Hero of the Holidays.

Kirby Meta Knight Plushie</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Picked by</strong>: IGN Deals Team</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are SO many plushies to choose from these days, but only so many unique ones for Nintendo lovers. Even across the Kirby online universe, there are several versions of cuddly Kirbys you can get.

Nintendo eShop Gift Card</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">On the practical side, we'd be remiss not to at least mention a safe bet for gamers: a Nintendo eShop gift card. Not sure if your pal already owns a game? Not sure what to get a Nintendo lover who already has everything you can think of? Let them pick and give them the freedom (and time) to shop Nintendo games and online merch themselves.

The monolith featured figures of all sorts of strange creators: skeletons, alligators, soldiers, a wolf, and more. In the time since, online gaming enthusiasts have been eagerly speculating as to what the monolith and Keighley were teasing ahead of The Game Awards. Diablo 4? The Elder Scrolls 6? God of War? Bloodborne 2? Altered Beast?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, the mystery may have been solved in advance of The Game Awards on Thursday.

Well, let's take a look at <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288427" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the trademarks</a>. It's for an image, and it looks like this:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/cj4jx4fzvcc523ya2tmalskfleibglrqbtfamb5nw5ujisnf565fmr7unsbd5jsl4ttwopcumgrig-1765310322978.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Now compare that to the big symbol at the center of the statue:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yeah, that's definitely the same symbol, so we're in the right place. Now, how do we know it's Divinity? Let's look at <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288420" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the next trademark registered at the same time by the same company</a>, simply for "Divinity", with a logo attached.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/cj4jx4fzvcc523ya2tmalskfleibglrqbtfamb5nw5ujisnf565ezczz2ayw37cfdb5x3ebc6mn4y-1765310040065.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we're getting somewhere! It's not exact, but it's quite comparable to past Divinity: Original Sin logos:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/header-1765310670854.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/header-1-1765310692505.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And even closer to the older Divinity games, slashed through "i" and all.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/logo-divine-divinity-1-1765312473079.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/logo-beyond-divinity-1765312488383.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, maybe it's all just a big coincidence? Sure, I guess. But there's one more clue. All three trademarks were filed by Ihde &amp; Partner Rechtsanwälte, a legal firm that, among other things, has previously filed trademarks for Larian Studios, including <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/017931129" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">past Divinity: Original Sin trademarks</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So that's pretty cut and dry. But what about that third trademark? This is where things get a bit more mysterious. This trademark is also just for an image, this one here:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/cj4jx4fzvcc523ya2tmalskfleibglrqbtfamb5nw5ujisnf565gq2lboaqot2jsa6vx2cxeqx22a-1765310920328.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">What's that? I have no idea. But it's probably related, given it was filed on the same day by the same firm and is in a similar style to the other trademarks. Maybe we'll find out on Thursday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Critically, this seems to be for a new Divinity...NOT a Divinity: Original Sin game. Director of publishing at Larian Studios Michael Douse was on Twitter/X today shutting down any rumors of a Divinity: Original Sin 3, but his language was very specific:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">There aren't currently any plans for a new Divinity Original Sin 3 game but once we are ready to show what we've been working on we will 🙏</p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1998484634397479293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">If this is indeed Divinity, that's good news for Larian fans, as Divinity: Original Sin 2 was fantastic. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/21/divinity-original-sin-2-review">gave it a 9.6/10</a>, saying, "Divinity: Original Sin 2 may have been designed in the spirit of decades-old RPGs like Baldur’s Gate 2, but that legacy serves only as a foundation for the expansive game Larian has built on top of it." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate 3 is Larian's most recent work, and that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">got an impressive 10/10 from us</a>. We said, "I don't want to say every CRPG going forward should aspire to be like Baldur's Gate 3. Not everything needs to be nearly this big and ambitious, or even this dense. But it is a landmark moment in the genre, and if I had to point to one paragon that I would like everyone else making these to take inspiration from, this is absolutely it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some may have clamored for Larian to immediately get to work on DLC or Baldur's Gate 4, Larian explicitly said over a year ago that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-wont-make-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-expansions-or-baldurs-gate-4">wouldn't be continuing with another D&amp;D game</a>. However, Larian CEO Swen Vincke has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-head-suggests-next-game-2029">teasing</a> a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-says-its-full-attention-is-on-its-next-game-media-blackout-for-the-foreseeable">new project</a> for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-baldurs-gate-3-turns-2-larian-boss-swen-vincke-talks-about-the-studios-next-game-and-asks-fans-for-their-patience-well-need-a-bit-of-time-to-make-it-all-work">while now</a>, and based on past timelines, this year's Game Awards would be a perfect time for an unveiling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
