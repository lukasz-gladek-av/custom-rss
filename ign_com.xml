            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">First impressions matter, right? Full Metal Schoolgirl throws you into its third-person shooter action shortly after a blazing fast anime-inspired opening to the tune of a J-rock banger. It immediately establishes its irreverent attitude and goofy anti-capitalist satire in a futuristic world where robots are exploited and referred to as "the working dead" – and with the goal of taking down a CEO villain, I thought to myself, "Hell yeah." But about halfway through a second run of this roguelike, it dawned on me that there just wasn't much to Full Metal Schoolgirl; it’s a dull and repetitive shooter whose gameplay foundations aren't quite good enough to save it from the largely tedious, unrewarding grind up its 100-floor tower.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Full Metal Schoolgirl - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During the intro sequence where you break into the evil Maternal Jobz Corporation, you choose to play as Ryoko or Akemi, two cyborg anime girls who are functionally and aesthetically human – the one you pick winds up being the lead character and the other gets captured and plays into the story as you progress. They're seeking revenge on the company and its CEO for working their dad to death, and the story's initial disdain for corporate bullshit is sharp in a way that reminded me of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-review"><u>Hi-Fi Rush</u></a>. However, that's as far as it goes before things devolve into annoying quips and no real intrigue to motivate each run; like most parts of Full Metal Schoolgirl, it doesn't build on its good ideas and its shallow execution on them wears thin rather quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I have a high tolerance for anime tropes, and here, it teeters between charming and eyerolling, and more frequently leans toward the latter. It's not just for its crass innuendos, but also in its incessant yapping that doesn't exude any memorable personality into its interesting premise. I'm not here to handwave the attention drawn to upskirts or the creepy actions of the doctor who upgrades your skills, either – it's just unnecessary. The moments its tropes really do work are at the very beginning and the very end, and it's as if everything in between was overlooked in the process, which is where you'll spend most of your time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Once you've given Full Metal Schoolgirl a couple runs, you've pretty much seen it all.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each floor is made up of a series of narrow hallways filled with enemy fodder alongside environmental hazards, as well as square office building rooms that function as small combat arenas. The latter throws optional challenges at you like clearing the room within a time limit or without using heals for extra money for upgrades. But this overall formula does not fundamentally change across its 100 procedurally generated floors. The scenery may change slightly for each block of floors, yet the structure stays the same. While they may throw different enemy types at you like drones, bomb-strapped robots, turrets, and mechanized dogs, no amount of mixing and matching them can make up for mediocre implementation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to see how the procedural generation clashes with itself when certain doors lead to a completely empty room or the combat challenge prompts just don't align with the way encounters are set up. This haphazard level design feels very basic at best and frustratingly messy at worst, and it persists through the large majority of the 14 hours I put into finishing the campaign. Boss fights act as endcaps to blocks of floors, and while they're relatively refreshing after blasting through the same areas over and over again, their attack patterns are quite telegraphed and simple to overcome. Still, I'll take dodging area-of-effect explosions and dumping my ultimates (or Punishment attacks, as it's called) into a spongy boss over thoughtlessly repeating identical floors of enemies, so I do wish these kinds of battles weren't so few and far between.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Defeating a boss grants you a key to start a subsequent run at their floor, which is a godsend to cut through the needless repetition – but, they're one-time-use. If a run goes sideways after using the key and you don't defeat the next boss 20-something floors up for the next key, get ready to start at a much lower level, buddy. While this raises the stakes, as any roguelike worth its salt should do, the disappointment of having to trudge through the most boring parts to make it back to where you left off doesn’t feel worth it. Even though it gets easier on account of upgrading your stats and abilities from the materials and money you earn from each run, ascending chunks of floors still takes a lot of time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was excited that this is an anime-style shooter at least, which is something I've been seeking since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/freedom-wars-remastered-hands-on-preserving-the-vita-classic-as-you-remember-it">Freedom Wars</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/03/sword-art-online-fatal-bullet-review">Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet</a> (which didn't quite capitalize on the premise). More often than not, playing through Full Metal Schoolgirl felt like a chore, but I can appreciate the mindless fun its mechanics sometimes offer. With a handful of specific guns and melee weapons I vibed with, I was able to get into a groove, turn my brain off, and just mow down mobs of enemies. Although most guns are pretty counterintuitive for the way encounters are designed, a high-level electric chaingun or chunky plasma ball launcher carry the right kind of weight and feedback you want from a shooter. That said, movement itself is a little too sticky for this style of game, especially when there are annoying platforming sections. And melee attacks and jumps are a tad unresponsive, even if cutting through a crowd with a katana's dash attack or the Labrys axe's aftershocks can be satisfying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's moments like these that started to shine though more frequently in the final chunk of floors. The rate at which genuinely challenging encounters presented themselves, and the confluence of weapons that were fun to use showed up, let Full Metal Schoolgirl finish on a higher note than the absolute slog it took to get there. It didn't exactly flip the script or break away from the conventions established at the start, but it began to make the most of its basic pieces by throwing almost everything at you at a brisk pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I progressed, I naturally figured out which types of guns worked for me – slow shotguns and rifles never made sense to use, but a strong SMG that'd overheat quickly became a favorite. Learning to manage my energy meter for big axe combos, dodging, and hoverdashing became more important in the late game. And weaving in your auto-attack drone (which you summon on a cooldown) was key to salvaging a few runs. Being smart with the scarce battery supply (which is your healing item) factored into how I approached combat as well. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Michael Higham's 10 Favorite Roguelike/lite Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rarity of gear you're rewarded with from challenge rooms is random, which leads to moments of pointlessness where I'd clear a challenge room only to be met with common level rarity items that pale in comparison to rare and legendary gear from much earlier floors. At least this makes the modifiers meaningful as they can affect how your health, energy, movement, and damage output works, especially when the shields you equip have a sizable impact on your survivability.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Once you've given Full Metal Schoolgirl a couple runs, you've pretty much seen it all. There are decent ideas with potential that meld the shooter genre and roguelike framework well – it's unfortunate that they get squandered by foundational shortcomings. Whether it be a misunderstanding of what makes the genre work or an intentionally derivative take on roguelike games, the loop it creates is woefully repetitive with boring level design. Although I found some mindless fun since its fundamental gameplay is decent and shines a bit brighter towards the very end, it's certainly not good enough to redeem this monotonous shooter. The anime-inspired charm wears thin as its tropes quickly become annoying, even if its premise shows promise. I got into a groove in its final hour as I ascended the last floors with gear and upgrades that were fun to use, but the climb to get there wasn't exactly worth the slog.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/full-metal-schoolgirl-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo, once the flagship Xbox exclusive, the video game Microsoft launched its first console with, has finally jumped ship. Microsoft has announced Halo: Campaign Evolved — a remake of the original game’s campaign — and it’s coming to PlayStation 5 day one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Unreal Engine 5 remake of the Bungie-developed 2001 campaign is set for launch in 2026 on PC, Xbox Series X and S, and, crucially, PS5. It is the first new Halo game since 2021’s Halo Infinite, and the first Halo ever to release on a PlayStation console. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-xbox-pc-and-yes-ps5-heres-everything-we-know-so-far-including-new-missions">IGN has played Halo: Campaign Evolved and has all the details right here</a>, including first info on the new three-mission prequel story arc. And yes, if you were wondering, there’s crossplay, which means Xbox, PC, and PlayStation owners can play Halo co-op together for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo: Campaign Evolved is the final nail in the coffin for the Xbox exclusive, then, although in truth the shooter series’ release on PlayStation does not come as any surprise. Xbox Game Studios is already one of the most prolific and successful publishers on PlayStation, and just this week <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-idea-of-locking-it-to-one-store-or-one-device-is-antiquated-for-most-people-xbox-president-says-microsoft-is-seeing-players-evolve-way-past-big-blockbuster-exclusive-games">Xbox president Sarah Bond called the idea of exclusive games “antiquated,”</a> so Microsoft’s thinking on this is crystal clear.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what has prompted Microsoft’s multiplatform push? A recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> report alleged that Microsoft is pushing Xbox studios to deliver a 30% margin — much higher than the industry average — and one of the ways studios can help bring in more money is by releasing their games on rival platforms, such as PlayStation and Nintendo Switch as well as PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One prominent critic of the exclusive is former president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America Shawn Layden, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-playstation-boss-shawn-layden-says-exclusivity-is-your-achilles-heel-if-game-costs-exceed-200-million"><u>last year said that when a video game’s costs exceed $200 million, “exclusivity is your Achilles’ heel.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It reduces your addressable market,” Layden told <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/how-former-playstation-boss-views-gamings-tumultuous-time-shawn-layden-interview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesBeat</u></a>, before citing the success of Arrowhead’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a>, which launched on PlayStation 5 and PC to explosive success. “Particularly when you’re in the world of live service gaming or free-to-play. Another platform is just another way of opening the funnel, getting more people in. In a free-to-play world, as we know, 95% of those people will never spend a nickel. The business is all about conversion. You have to improve your odds by cracking the funnel open. Helldivers 2 has shown that for PlayStation, coming out on PC at the same time. Again, you get that funnel wider. You get more people in.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Layden said single-player games have a similar audience consideration as multiplayer games, though not exactly the same. “For single-player games it’s not the same exigency,” he said. “But if you’re spending $250 million, you want to be able to sell it to as many people as possible, even if it’s just 10% more.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Halo: Campaign Evolved – First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Layden’s comments echo those of former Xbox boss Peter Moore, who in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore"><u>a recent interview with IGN</u></a> suggested Microsoft will be debating internally whether to release Xbox poster-child Halo on PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If Microsoft says, wait, we're doing $250 million on our own platforms, but if we then took Halo as, let's call it a third-party, we could do a billion… You got to think long and hard about that, right?” Moore said. “I mean, you just got to go, yeah, should it be kept? It's a piece of intellectual property. It's bigger than just a game. And how do you leverage that? Those are the conversations that always happen with, how do you leverage it in everything that we would do?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft’s stance on exclusives has become one of the biggest talking points in the Xbox community, and that conversation will only grow louder now we know Halo has made the jump to PlayStation. Microsoft’s approach is in stark contrast to Nintendo and Sony’s. Nintendo has the most hardline policy on its games, releasing them on its consoles only. Sony has softened its approach in recent years, releasing its multiplayer, live service games on PC at the same time as PlayStation (and in the case of Helldivers 2, eventually on Xbox). But Sony still refuses to launch its big single-player games on anything other than PlayStation day one (the latest example of this is Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yotei).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now Campaign Evolved is confirmed for PS5, there is no going back for Halo. Indeed, it seems Halo is from this day forward as much a PlayStation game as it is an Xbox game. Speaking tonight on a panel at the Halo World Championships 2025, Halo Community Director, Brian Jarrard, teased: "It's really a new era. Halo is on PlayStation going forward, starting with Halo: Campaign Evolved."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-project-update-2025-everything-announced-updating-live">everything announced at Halo Studios’ Halo: Campaign Evolved panel for more</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
