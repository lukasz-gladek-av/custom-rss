This will also let them implement some of the changes they've discovered and that have been requested during this beta phase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, Funcom said the delay will allow for a "large-scale beta weekend next month where even more of you will get the opportunity to play the game and share your feedback." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this may be disappointing for some who want to jump into Dune: Awakening as soon as possible, Funcom is hosting a combat livestream later today at 12pm ET/9am PT, which will reveal more about PvP and PvE mechanics, archetypes, and skills.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We here at IGN are excited about Dune: Awakening, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-the-final-preview">we said in our hands-on preview</a> that, "It's easy to be sceptical about an MMO survival game set in the  Duniverse, but after a few bouts of dehydration and sunstroke, the day I spent in Arrakis convinced me that Dune: Awakening is one to watch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out details on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-dev-says-its-release-date-is-the-full-launch-and-while-theres-no-subscription-there-will-be-optional-dlcs">the MMO's business model and post-launch plans</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-trailer-shows-in-depth-gameplay-at-gamescom-onl">in-depth gameplay trailer that was revealed at Gamescom ONL last year.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Have a tip for us?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-just-caught-discounted-pokmon-tcg-journey-together-etbs-and-booster-bundles<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After the mess of a launch, I didn’t expect <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">Journey Together</a> to bounce back this quickly. But here we are. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-stock-update-journey-together-lost-origin-ex-big-boxes">Amazon</a> has the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-etb-amazon-in-stock">Elite Trainer Box</a> for $70.31 and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-march-31-2025">Booster Bundle</a> for $37.97, which is basically MSRP. These were the same products people were scalping three weeks ago like they were made of gold-foil Charizards. Now they’re just available. In stock. From Amazon. I’m not used to this kind of peace.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Discounted Pokémon TCG: Journey Together ETBs and Booster Bundles </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It helps that single card prices have completely cratered. That early panic-buy energy is gone, and what’s left is actually kind of nice: a good-looking set, still fun to open, finally accessible. This feels like the most relaxed a Pokémon TCG release has been since Stellar Crown. I think it’s a great time to grab sealed product, especially if you skipped launch week and spent it watching TCGPlayer listings implode in real time like I did.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violetjourne"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journe">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="9935b355-d0a8-480b-882e-2349ca642bd7" id="218696"><div id="218696" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one’s loaded: nine Journey Together booster packs, a full-art foil N’s Zorua, card sleeves, energy, dice, condition markers, and a code card for Live. You also get the little booklet that tells you all about what you probably won’t pull, which is always a comforting touch. I like this as a shelf piece and a slow-open project. Rip one pack a night like a tiny cardboard advent calendar of hope.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for singles, the ETB exclusive card N’s Zorua isn’t bad, but the bigger chase cards are finally landing where they probably should have started. Lillie’s Clefairy ex SIR is still pricey at $180, though that’s less than half of its pre-order peak. N’s Zoroark ex is now around $13, and even the stamped version is cheaper than a movie ticket. I think if you’re going to open sealed product, now is the time when the math doesn’t feel like a straight-up scam.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violetjourne"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journe">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journey Together Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="9935b355-d0a8-480b-882e-2349ca642bd7" id="218697"><div id="218697" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journey Together Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Six booster packs, no fluff. This is the set I grab when I just want to rip packs and pretend I’m still chasing something spicy. It’s cheaper than the ETB, and you’re not paying extra for sleeves or dividers you already have too many of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The card market around this set has basically been a free fall, which makes this a way more interesting buy now. Salamence ex SIR dropped from $250 to about $106, and I think it’ll settle closer to $100. Iono’s Bellibolt ex, which I was convinced was going to be a banger, is chilling around $8. That’s not great news if you bought in early, but it’s fantastic if you’re just now joining the party with a Booster Bundle in hand.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Jour">Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together Sleeved Booster</h2></p><div catalogid="9935b355-d0a8-480b-882e-2349ca642bd7" id="218698"><div id="218698" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together Sleeved Booster</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up one of these mostly because I had $10 of Amazon credit I forgot about, but honestly, it wasn’t a bad gamble. One pack, random blister artwork, ten cards, and either a sense of joy or quiet resignation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up one of these mostly because I had $10 of Amazon credit I forgot about, but honestly, it wasn’t a bad gamble.

Six booster packs, a full-art Bellibolt ex, a foil Tadbulb, and some fun extras like a sticker and a display backdrop. Is any of that necessary? No. Did I want it anyway? Absolutely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bellibolt’s cards are doing what most of this set’s full arts have done: falling like a rock. The standard full-art Bellibolt ex is now $7 to $8, and the Special Illustration Rare is around $80. That’s still expensive, but it’s a far cry from the early days when people were pricing it like it was a lost Iono alt-art. I think this is a fun pick for fans of the character, and I don't mind paying for charm when the market has stopped pretending it's gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
