            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> bundle is still live at Best Buy for $499.99, and it’s a smart pickup if you’re planning to get both anyway. You save $20 off the digital copy of the game, and with Switch 2 stock being all over the place, locking one in now isn’t a bad move.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokemon TCG</a> side, both the Black Bolt and White Flare Elite Trainer Boxes have dipped below Amazon pricing on TCGPlayer, now sitting at $91.50 and $90.98, respectively. That’s some of the best pricing we’ve seen outside of limited restocks, and probably your best shot at avoiding inflated third-party listings (although it's still way over MSRP).</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in today’s deals, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is $799.99 at Best Buy, which is $500 off its usual price and a great buy for an unlocked flagship. ROG Ally is also down to $499.99 with the Z1 Extreme chip and 512GB storage, which makes it one of the better portable gaming options if you want full Windows access. Soundcore P20i earbuds are just $19.98, the Anker 332 Power Strip is $15.99, and the upgraded 100W Anker Nano Charging Station is $35.99. All three are practical, everyday gear at their lowest prices in weeks.</p><p id="switch-2-pokmon-legends-z-a-bund"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A Bund">Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225666"><div id="225666" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Launching the same time as Pokémon Legends: Z-A, this bundle knocks a cool $20 off the digital price tag of the game (digital code included). We're not at the custom limited edition console point of the Switch 2's life cycle yet, but this is a smart way to secure the system and save some money whilst doing it. Just preorder quickly - I'm amazed Best Buy still has it live.</p></div><p id="pokmon-legends-z-a"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A">Pokémon Legends: Z-A (Switch 2)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225675"><div id="225675" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This $69.99 version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the Switch 1 game with the Switch 2 upgrade included. From what we've seen so far, we're talking 4K resolutions running at a buttery smooth 60 frames per second. Real-time battles, a fully explorable Lumiose City, and nighttime Z-A Royale events all benefit from the sharper visuals and faster load times. If you're already going in on a Switch 2, this is the version to get. It looks like the most technically ambitious Pokémon game yet, and Switch 2 seems to be the only way to experience it at its best.</p></div><p id="pokmon-legends-z-a"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A">Pokémon Legends: Z-A (Switch 1)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225676"><div id="225676" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not ready to upgrade to a Nintendo Switch 2 yet, the Switch 1 version still has an upgrade path so you have options down the line. Legends Z-A switches things up with real-time battles, an urban setting in Lumiose City, and the full return of Mega Evolutions, including 27 new forms like Mega Dragonite. The starter picks are a nice throwback, but what really caught my attention is the Z-A Royale system and Alpha Pokémon lurking across the city at night. Add in deep trainer customization and the Switch 2 upgrade option, and it’s clear the developers are trying to evolve more than just the Pokémon this time. If it plays as good as it sounds, this could be the next real shift for the series.</p></div><p id="black-bolt-elite-trainer-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box">Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225517"><div id="225517" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The fluxuations on this Elite Trainer Box has been crazy this week, but TCG Player finally has listings cheaper than Amazon starting at $91.50, around $20 cheaper than the big box giant. This is likely the cheapest you'll find it outside of a flash sale and pot luck restocks.</p></div><p id="pokemon-tcg-white-flare-elite-traine"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG White Flare Elite Traine">Pokemon TCG White Flare Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225580"><div id="225580" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG White Flare Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the same situation with the White Flare Elite Trainer Box, slightly cheaper than Black Bolt and around $13 worth of savings based on Amazon pricing. Again, it's a good time to buy.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">The Most Expensive Black Bolt White Flare Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're seeing some of the highest valued cards in the Scarlet and Violet era in Black Bolt White Flare.

It's above MSRP, but good luck finding a better price during Pokémania 2025.</p></div><p id="prismatic-evolutions-booster-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundle">Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225654"><div id="225654" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is currently $10 cheaper than TCG Player with Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundles, but it's still way over MSRP. Like all other sealed TCG products at the moment though, they're hard to find for shelf price.</p></div><p id="pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violetjourne"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journe">Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journey Together Booster Build &amp; Battle Box</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225584"><div id="225584" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Journey Together Build &amp; Battle Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only is Amazon over a dollar cheaper, you're saving on postage too compared to TCG Player.

Not only is the Black Bolt ETB vastly undercutting the secondary market, Paradox Rift ETB is even cheaper (and an overlooked set in my opinion, stock up now). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's other great deals on ex boxes too, which are also near MSRP and around the same or just under listings on TCG Player. The sealed market is becoming more competitive, so it's more important than ever to give eBay a quick check before hitting buy.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Nintendo Switch 2 Stock Updates</h2></p><div catalogid="e7c6732a-ef4d-47d3-8a5e-d382139346bf" id="225579"><div id="225579" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 - Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In a shocking move, Target is selling both Nintendo Switch 2 SKUs without preorders, waiting lists or raffles, so snap them up quickly. As predicted, Nintendo Switch 2's launch window is seeing stock shortages in the US. If you didn't preorder at launch, you've probably been waiting for stock drops since launch.</p></div><div catalogid="e7c6732a-ef4d-47d3-8a5e-d382139346bf" id="225578"><div id="225578" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon currently has its invitation system in place for both the standard console SKU and the Mario Kart world bundle, so it's always worth getting on the waiting list whilst you wait.

You’re getting a 200 megapixel camera, a sharp 6.8 inch OLED display, and enough power to handle anything. It works with nearly every carrier and still includes a built-in stylus, which is rare and actually useful.</p></div><p id="rog-ally-amd-ryzen-z1-extreme-512gb"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="ROG Ally AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme 512GB">ROG Ally AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme 512GB</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225763"><div id="225763" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>ROG Ally AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme 512GB</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At $499.99, this is the lowest I’ve seen the ROG Ally go with the Z1 Extreme chip and 512GB of storage. It runs Windows, so I can launch anything I already own on Steam or Game Pass without workarounds. The 120Hz screen is sharp and responsive, and I like that I can dock it or plug in a mouse and keyboard without needing extra gear.</p></div><p id="soundcore-wireless-earbuds"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Soundcore Wireless Earbuds">Soundcore Wireless Earbuds</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225764"><div id="225764" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Soundcore Wireless Earbuds</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At $19.98, these are about as cheap as I’ve seen for wireless earbuds that aren’t complete junk. You get 10 hours on single a charge, decent sound with actual bass, and the app gives you EQ control if you want to tweak things. Call quality is fine with two mics, and they’re small enough to carry around without thinking about it. For under twenty bucks, they do what they’re supposed to without falling apart.</p></div><p id="anker-332-usb-c-power-strip-surge-pr"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Anker 332 USB C Power Strip Surge Pr">Anker 332 USB C Power Strip Surge Protector</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225765"><div id="225765" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker 332 USB C Power Strip Surge Protector</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For $15.99, this is cheaper than most basic surge protectors and does way more. You get six outlets, USB-C charging with 20W power delivery, and a compact design that actually fits in tighter spots. It’s not going to blow you away, but it’s soound for a desk or nightstand setup, and the surge protection is better than the usual bargain bin stuff. At this price, I’d grab one just to stop moving my charger between rooms.</p></div><p id="anker-nano-charging-station"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Anker Nano Charging Station">Anker Nano Charging Station</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225766"><div id="225766" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker Nano Charging Station</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At $35.99, this is one of the few charging stations that can handle a laptop and still have room for everything else. Two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and three AC outlets is more than enough for a desk setup, and the 100W output means it actually charges a MacBook Pro properly. It keeps cables out of the way and cuts down on the need for multiple bricks. It’s compact, works well, and replaces at least two chargers and a power strip in one go.</p></div><p id="portable-neck-fan-with-led-display"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Portable Neck Fan With LED Display">Portable Neck Fan With LED Display</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225669"><div id="225669" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Portable Neck Fan With LED Display</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At $17.99, this neck fan is cheaper than a cumbersome handheld fan and way more useful. It's lightweight, quiet, and actually hands-free, which makes it easy to wear while working, traveling, or just trying to survive another summer heatwave. The LED display is a nice bonus since you don’t have to guess how much battery life is left, and the bladeless design means no hair tangles. Five speed settings and up to 15 hours of runtime for under twenty bucks? That’s a win.</p></div><p id="fourth-wing-wing-and-claw-collectio"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fourth Wing (Wing and Claw Collectio">Fourth Wing (Wing and Claw Collection) (The Empyrean, 1)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225670"><div id="225670" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fourth Wing (Wing and Claw Collection) (The Empyrean, 1)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're collecting The Empyrean series, this new edition of Fourth Wing is worth a look. It’s down to $23.09 right now, and the updated hardcover comes with stenciled edges to match Iron Flame and Onyx Storm, which should appeal to anyone trying to keep their shelf setup clean and consistent. This is a limited first print run for the U.S. and Canada, so it’s a good chance to own a unique version of your future favorite book series for a steal. </p></div><p id="iron-flame-standard-edition-the"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Iron Flame (Standard Edition) (The "> Iron Flame (Standard Edition) (The Empyrean, 2)</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225672"><div id="225672" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Iron Flame (Standard Edition) (The Empyrean, 2)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're already deep into Fourth Wing, grabbing Iron Flame for $13.92 is a no-brainer, especially with the list price pushing $30. The narration from Rebecca Soler adds a solid layer to the story, and this sequel dives straight into the brutality and politics of Basgiath without slowing down. Things are darker, the stakes are higher, and Violet’s got even more to lose. It’s long, intense, and exactly what fans of the first book are probably hoping for.</p></div><p id="anker-laptop-power-bank-25000mah"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Anker Laptop Power Bank, 25,000mAh">Anker Laptop Power Bank, 25,000mAh</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225671"><div id="225671" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker Laptop Power Bank, 25,000mAh</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The 25,000mAh capacity on this bad boy is enough to charge a laptop and a few other devices on the go, with the triple 100W USB-C ports make it way more versatile than your average power bank.

You’re getting all three Dark Knight films in 4K with HDR, plus Blu-rays and digital copies, all packed in exclusive Steelbook cases that are made for collectors. Nolan’s trilogy still holds up as some of the best superhero filmmaking, and if you're going to own it this is the version to get.</p></div><p id="funko-pop-plus-the-lord-of-the-rin"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Funko Pop!

It’s the glow-in-the-dark version, and Funkos usually hold up well over time on a shelf or desk (especially boxed). For the price, it’s a low-effort way to round out a collection or grab a gift that doesn’t feel like a cop out.</p></div><p id="bookoo-jump-starter-2000a"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="BOOKOO Jump Starter 2000A">BOOKOO Jump Starter 2000A</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225677"><div id="225677" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>BOOKOO Jump Starter 2000A</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>For Car/Boat/Lawnmower(8.0L Gas/6.5L Diesel Engine) </p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For under $35, this jump starter is a solid backup to keep in the car, especially with how often batteries can die without warning.

The clarity difference and range is top-tier, not to mention the jack, XLR and aux outputs available on each monitor that fits in perfectly in everyone's setup.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here come the Fares followers, and this one could be mighty special.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Josef Fares-directed co-op games from Hazelight have been so good – and crucially, also so commercially successful – that it’s about time we started seeing some other developers trying to get in on that artistically beautiful, mandatory two-player action. And Out of Words, from poet Morten Søndergaard and co-developers WiredFly and Kong Orange, not only fits the mold cast by Fares, but has the potential to be as good as anything the former filmmaker has made so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s purely coincidental that Out of Words has so much in common with Hazelight’s games, but it’s an interesting coincidence nonetheless. Søndergaard, like Fares, is a European artist who came from outside of the games industry. And Out of Words promises an emotional two-player coming-of-age physics-based puzzle platforming journey for its pair of handcrafted protagonists, Kurt and Karla. Those parallels aside, though, Out of Words very clearly looks set to stand tall on its own two feet. First of all, it’s absolutely gorgeous, and completely handmade. Literally. Each character and set piece was made in real life and painstakingly animated frame by frame. In motion it looks – and sounds – absolutely gorgeous. I got to play it for a quick 20 minutes, but if the entire game is anything like my brief hands-on, then this could be up there with anything Hazelight has made so far.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Søndergaard jumped me around to a few different parts of the story, but I got to see a bit of the beginning, when Kurt and Karla find themselves transported to Vokabulantis just as they are each trying to find the words to say that they have feelings for each other. They awaken to find that they have no mouths – kinda like that part in The Matrix, but less disturbing – and must find new ways to communicate. This translates in game terms to co-op puzzles, usually physics-based. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>They awaken to find that they have no mouths – kinda like that part in The Matrix, but less disturbing.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, in one section I played, whichever one of you held Aleph, a pet creature that is a literal symbol of your friendship, would have their gravity reversed and float up to the ceiling, while the other stayed on the ground. Navigating through various vertically oriented sections required careful timing of both jumping and tossing Aleph to the other person, lest one of you fall into the abyss. In another area, Kurt and Karla came to an area under Vokabulantis, where books are stacked everywhere and the doubt about their feelings for each other is represented by literal darkness. And in yet another spot, you both become a ball of primordial clay with each of you controlling an arm that can jut out from the body of the clay ball to grab onto the environment. You must work together to successfully work your way through all of the obstacles in your path. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Out of Words - SGF 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I mentioned music earlier for good reason. During a serene early moment, as the two of you run across a puddle-strewn grassy field, a subtle-but-powerful musical note hits every time either of you jumps and lands back on the ground. Hopefully there are more moments like that throughout Out of Words’s run, as it added a poignant punch to what promises to be a very emotional game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, if all of this sounds…<em>weird</em>, I get it. It’s definitely weird. But when you and a friend sit down to play it, via cross-play online co-op or together on a couch in same-screen, it’ll all start to make sense. I can’t say I’ve played a game quite like Out of Words. Sure, it has a lot in common with Hazelight’s body of work, but it’s also very much its own unique expression of art and story. The art I can already definitively vouch for, and the story? Well, let’s see what kind of metaphors, morals, and moments the poet Søndergaard can deliver when Out of Words ships for PC (via Epic Games Store), PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026. I can’t wait.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unmatched-board-game-buying-guide.1252317/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it’s a repurposing of an older game, Star Wars: Epic Duels, the Unmatched series quickly made a name for itself as the premier head-to-head skirmish board game after its release in 2019. Its formula of simple rules married to giving each character their own deck of cards, ensuring a unique feel and endlessly tweakable gameplay, shot it to the top of the charts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, its success has ensured that it’s spawned a dizzying array of different sets, all of which can be mixed and matched. After all, one of the key selling points of the series is that it lets you pit anyone from its bewildering array of fantasy and franchised characters against any other, offering huge replay value.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are so many sets available that we’re focusing on in-print ones for this guide, although it’s not hard to find the older ones second-hand. But if you’re confused by where to get into this exciting universe of carnage, or how best to expand your collection, we’re here to help with a rundown of the various options. Fundamentally, however, it’s a fantastic franchise with a strong core system, so wherever you start you’re unlikely to go wrong.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Unfranchised Versions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Unmatched box was Battle of Legends, which featured a variety of mythical characters from across the world. Even while it’s spun off into various licensed products, the series has continued to maintain this line and, unless you’re a superfan of one of the franchised versions available, these remain the best place to start.</p><p id="battle-of-legends-vol-1"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Battle of Legends Vol. 1">Unmatched - Battle of Legends Vol. 1</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225691"><div id="225691" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Battle of Legends Vol. 1</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It speaks to the strength of the series as a whole that <strong>the very first set that launched it all is still the best place to start for most players</strong>. You get four characters from a diverse range of global mythology: King Arthur, Sinbad, Medusa and Alice, of wonderland fame. Each has a unique playstyle which fits their background, with Alice able to turn from small to big for different bonuses, for example, while King Arthur can sacrifice his cards for super-powerful sword attacks.</p></div><p id="battle-of-legends-vol-2"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Battle of Legends Vol. 2">Unmatched - Battle of Legends Vol. 2</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225695"><div id="225695" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Battle of Legends Vol. 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">By the time Volume 2 came out, Unmatched as a whole had diversified strongly, so the designers had to dig deep to find some new play angles for the four included characters. The results are great, but not necessarily the best place to start out as they’re a bit off-the-wall and require some extra rules to learn. Sun Wukong, the trickster Monkey King, can create clones of himself to harass other players while urban Legend Bloody Mary gets extra actions as long as she’s holding at least three cards. It is, however, a great addition to a burgeoning collection.</p></div><p id="cobble-fog"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Cobble &amp; Fog">Unmatched - Cobble &amp; Fog</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225696"><div id="225696" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Cobble &amp; Fog</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>While this might not be the best place to begin your Unmatched collection, as some of the characters take a bit of experience to handle, Cobble &amp; Fog is probably the best box overall in the entire series</strong>. It features fighters from Victorian gothic fiction: Dracula, Dr Jekyll (and of course Mr Hyde), Sherlock Holmes and the Invisible Man. Not only is this an inspiring selection of very popular characters but they’re also well-balanced, with each bringing out their theme superbly during play, as we discussed during our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unmatched-cobble-and-fog-board-game-review"><u>review of Cobble &amp; Fog</u></a>.</p></div><p id="slings-and-arrows"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Slings and Arrows">Unmatched - Slings and Arrows</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225697"><div id="225697" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Slings and Arrows</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the newest sets in the series also has potentially the most surprising source, drawing as it does on the works of Shakespeare. It feels unlikely that the bard ever imagined what might happen if The Three Witches from Macbeth, Hamlet, Titania, and Shakespeare himself ever fought a pitched battle in his home base of the Globe Theatre, London, but now you can find out for yourself if you’ve a mind. It’s a really fun set but it’s also a bit too crazy for beginners, with the Witches throwing cards into brewing a potion and Shakespeare counting words on his cards to keep in iambic pentameter.</p></div><p id="unmatched-adventures-tales-to-amaze"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Unmatched Adventures: Tales to Amaze">Unmatched Adventures: Tales to Amaze</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225698"><div id="225698" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched Adventures: Tales to Amaze</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Tales to Amaze is an outlier in the Unmatched world as it’s designed as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> experience, where players take a motley mix of fictional and real-world characters from a supercharged version of Nikolai Tesla to mythical flatboat captain Annie Christmas, and team up against either the Mothman or a Martian invasion. It works surprisingly well as a cooperative game thanks to tons of variety in enemy movement and minions and, as a bonus, you can also use the included characters in traditional competitive Unmatched too, although you’ll need a board from one of the other base sets to do so. It’s unusual enough that we gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unmatched-adventures-tales-to-amaze-board-game-review"><u>Tales to Amaze a full review rundown</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Witcher</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The series’ newest franchise is a biggie: the Witcher universe made famous by CD Projekt Red’s hugely popular <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/the-witcher">series of video games</a>. If you’re one of its legions of fans, these adaptations will do you proud and you can jump straight in. But since this edition contains three characters rather than the four in older sets, those previous boxes represent better value.</p></div><p id="the-witcher-steel-silver"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="The Witcher: Steel &amp; Silver">Unmatched - The Witcher: Steel &amp; Silver</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225699"><div id="225699" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - The Witcher: Steel &amp; Silver</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the better of the two Witcher sets released so far, not least because it includes the titular Witcher, Geralt of Rivia himself, a powerful melee character who you can customize to some extent to suit your playstyle. He’s accompanied by Ciri, who can chain “source” cards to escalate effects, making for tough choices as to what order to play things in, and by The Ancient Leshen who has a terrifying card that transforms him into crows, allowing him to move anywhere on the board.</p></div><p id="the-witcher-realms-fall"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="The Witcher: Realms Fall">Unmatched - The Witcher: Realms Fall</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225700"><div id="225700" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - The Witcher: Realms Fall</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Without Geralt, this box has to fall back on the famous sorceresses of the series, Philippa Eilhart, Triss Merigold and Yennefer of Vengerburg, except the latter two are presented as one character in a kind of double act: you can choose which is the main character and which is the sidekick. All have a varied and powerful mix of cards, as befits sorcerers from the Witcher world. Rounding out the set is the head of the Wild Hunt Eredin, a brutal close-combat fighter with powerful attacks.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Marvel</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As if just having the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-marvel-board-games">Marvel</a> franchise wasn’t enough, these sets also change the formula of basic Unmatched by including item tokens. These are placed randomly on the board and provide minor boosts to the player that picks them up. Vanilla boards were the only weak points in the series so this is a good change, but it’s perhaps less well-suited for newcomers, especially since, again, these sets all have three characters instead of four.</p></div><p id="marvel-redemption-row"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Marvel - Redemption Row">Unmatched: Marvel - Redemption Row</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225701"><div id="225701" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Marvel - Redemption Row</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The best of the Marvel boxes is Redemption Row</strong>. Of its three heroes, Ghost Rider has hellfire-powered movement while Luke Cage is well-nigh invulnerable without some smart cardplay to get around his booster defences and Moon Knight rotates through different powers as he responds to the changing lunar phases. They’re all fun characters, well balanced out of the box and fun to pit head to head.</p></div><p id="marvel-brains-and-brawn"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Marvel - Brains and Brawn">Unmatched: Marvel - Brains and Brawn</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225702"><div id="225702" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Marvel - Brains and Brawn</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Of all the Marvel sets this one probably has the most popular selection of characters</strong>. Spider-Man uses his spider-sense to force your opponent to show their played combat cards before you respond. She-Hulk has a mass of hit points and can discard cards to damage opponents and, last but certainly not least, Doctor Strange relies on a very fun and varied deck of spell effects to mess with his enemies. </p></div><p id="marvel-for-king-and-country"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Marvel - For King and Country">Unmatched: Marvel - For King and Country</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225703"><div id="225703" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Marvel - For King and Country</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Get the Avengers assembling with this box. Black Widow has a very unusual approach that sees her playing mission cards from among her hand, with requirements she can then fulfil for an extra bonus. Black Panther’s suit lets him steal cards from other players, and the Winter Soldier has enormously powerful card effects, many of which come with a downside as a result of his tortured psyche. </p></div><p id="marvel-hells-kitchen"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Marvel - Hell's Kitchen">Unmatched: Marvel - Hell's Kitchen</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225704"><div id="225704" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Marvel - Hell's Kitchen</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hell’s Kitchen features some of Marvel’s shadier characters. Bullseye is a ranged monster, able to strike from an extended distance and with cards that can have extra effects when you win combat. Daredevil has a fraught and exciting push your luck element but Elektra lets the side down a bit with her resurrect mechanic: she’s still fun to play but doesn’t feel as varied or as interesting as the other two inclusions.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Two-Figure Sets</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the bigger boxes, Unmatched also offers smaller sets that only have two fighters. In theory these should be a cheaper entry point into the system but in practice, stock shortages mean they can cost you as much as a full base game set. </p></div><p id="robin-hood-vs-big-foot"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Robin Hood vs. Big Foot">Unmatched - Robin Hood vs. Big Foot</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225705"><div id="225705" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Robin Hood vs. Big Foot</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The cage match of the century that you never knew you wanted, both these characters are really interesting to play. Robin Hood has a unique hit and run style, supported by a band of merry men, while Bigfoot gets to draw extra cards if he’s alone in a zone at the end of the turn. This makes them good complimentary opponents but they also work well integrated into other sets.</p></div><p id="suns-origin"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Sun’s Origin">Unmatched - Sun’s Origin</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225706"><div id="225706" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Sun’s Origin</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This set offers two historical Japanese characters. Tomoe Gozen is a ranged and highly mobile character, who matches well against Oda Nobunaga’s ability to boost friendly melee characters. Both are hard to master so, together with the castle board and its interesting split-level setup, this is a better addition for seasoned Unmatched collectors than newcomers.</p></div><p id="houdini-vs-the-genie"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Houdini vs. The Genie">Unmatched: Houdini vs. The Genie</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225707"><div id="225707" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Houdini vs. The Genie</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A legendary magician faces off against a very famous fake magician in this pairing. Neither is especially inspiring: Houdini is presented as a melee fighter, for some reason, who can use boost cards to pop up around the board, while the Genie can discard cards to take extra actions for some super-powered turns.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 24, 2025 1:58 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/unmatched-board-game-expansions-buying-guide]]></content:encoded>
