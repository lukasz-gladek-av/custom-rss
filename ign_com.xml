For embattled publisher Ubisoft, it is a reliable earner <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisofts-founding-guillemot-family-and-tencent-reportedly-considering-taking-the-company-private-amid-high-profile-flops-and-share-price-collapse">at a time when new releases such as Star Wars: Outlaws and Call of Duty competitor XDefiant have struggled</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The addition of crossplay means players will be able to play with friends from other platforms seamlessly, with console players able to join the PC player pool. Squads including a PC player will be automatically moved to the PC-matchmaking pool. However, PC players will not have the option to join the console matchmaking pool. Console players who play Ranked playlists with crossplay active will maintain a PC rank that is separate from their console rank, Ubisoft explained.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The anticheat updates include improved cheater detection to ensure fairness, Ubisoft said. With the arrival of PC and console crossplay, players with a Mousetrap Penalty will be forced into the PC matchmaking pool for 90 days. If crossplay is turned off, these players will be unable to join matchmaking until the option is turned back on. Additionally, matches with a detected cheater will be automatically canceled with no impact on MMR. “These changes reflect Rainbow Six Siege’s ongoing commitment to player protection,” Ubisoft added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Related, Ubisoft has overhauled the Reputation Center to provide a clearer overview of how different actions affect player standing and thresholds for receiving warnings or penalties. Account-related information such as rank, reputation, and match replays will be concentrated in the new Career hub, with account stats coming soon, Ubisoft clarified.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Blackbeard now has an upgraded Adaptable Shield gadget, and the Siege Cup beta is available to all players above Clearance Level 50. Siege Cup is Siege’s most competitive playlist, where five-player squads compete in skill-based ladder tournaments for Competitive Coins that can be used to unlock exclusive skin collections every two weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, Season 4 makes changes to Ballistic Shields and balancing updates for Attacking Operators Ying and Sens. The number of bullets needed to suppress Shield Operators have been reduced to add value to suppressive fire and improve Shield Operator counterplay. This allows suppression to occur sooner and last for a longer duration, Ubisoft explained. Operators will not take damage from melee attacks while shielded, but guard break intensity from melee attacks will remain the same. Ying’s rush has been changed "to encourage more precise gameplay" in addition to Sens’ R.O.U. Projectors update "that allows for more flexible and creative play."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

It helps that Half-Life 2 also went ‘free to keep’ until today, November 18.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> launched on November 16, 2004, a year after Steam itself. Public records for the game’s concurrent player count only begin in September 2008, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/220/charts/#max" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a>, so we don’t know how many played Half-Life 2 at launch 20 years ago. But we do know that at no point since September 2008 has Half-Life 2 been as popular on Steam as it is now. Half-Life 2's previous recorded best was 16,101 in August 2021 after a community event sparked a resurgence of interest.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The anniversary update means Half-Life 2 now includes the complete Episode One and Episode Two expansions along with the base game. They’re accessible from the main menu, and you automatically advance to the next expansion after completing each one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a new Developers Commentary for the Half-Life 2 base game, after Valve got the team back to record three-and-a-half hours of new behind-the-scenes commentary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most exciting is integrated Steam Workshop support, which lets players browse, install, and play user-created content for Half-Life 2 without ever leaving the game. Meanwhile, there are bug fixes and new graphics options that let players push the visual fidelity of Half-Life 2 further than was allowed in the original release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All these updates, the documentary and its associated headlines, and the ‘free to keep’ offer have combined to boost interest in all things Half-Life 2, and send thousands of players into City 17 to fight back against the Combine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, will Valve finally follow it up with Half-Life 3?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It lets the part swiftly and seamlessly travel around the world, even interrupting the imposing Weapons as they potter about the map.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The airship is set to star in the third and final part of Square Enix’s Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy, but some fans had wondered whether the original airship system would be replicated in the upcoming game, given its expanded detail and scope. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/17/05-ff7r-art-1117-2-q570dxz0p-1731880505496.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Aerith and the Highwind airship in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.

How low or high will the Highwind be able to fly over the game map? Will you be able to land and pop out at any location? Will airship travel be seamless across the entire planet, with no loading? Will Part 3 represent the game map in a different way to accommodate airship traversal?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be some time before we find out.
