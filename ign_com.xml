PhantomSomnus then explained that "split-screen mode is built into Unreal Engine, [Stellar Blade developer] Shift Up did not create it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's how PhantomSomnus managed to load a second Eve into their game. The split-screen multiplayer in the video was not developed by Shift Up, it was made by PhantomSomnus using Unreal Engine's native local multiplayer support. "The reason why I set up split-screen was to see if I could get any of it to work, but as you can see I failed," PhantomSomnus explained in a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stellarblade/comments/1l0r2wy/comment/mvfs6w7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="pt" dir="ltr">O modder <a href="https://twitter.com/phantomSomnus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@phantomSomnus</a> encontrou nos arquivos de Stellar Blade referências a multiplayer.<br>E neste vídeo, com uma 2ª Eve spawnada, a tela surpresamente se divide em duas, como se o jogo estivesse preparado para um modo co-op local (dois controles)<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StellarBlade?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#StellarBlade</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StellarBladePC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#StellarBladePC</a> <a href="https://t.co/QIeiu5lKSI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/QIeiu5lKSI</a> <a href="https://t.co/rp7oudcnV2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/rp7oudcnV2</a></p>— Stellar Blade Brasil (@StellarBladeBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/StellarBladeBR/status/1929028612126060916?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"There ARE signs of multiplayer in the game," PhantomSomnus said, "but they're online only."

The "old scrapped/unused multiplayer PVP mode," as Somnus calls it, no longer works, but they did <a href="https://x.com/phantomSomnus/status/1928599602862690389" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>discover</u></a> "some menus left over."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Does this mean be any kind of multiplayer update or mod in the future for Stellar Blade?
