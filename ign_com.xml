            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">This one sounds far in the future.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hideo Kojima has discussed his upcoming PlayStation exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project">Physint</a> during a Kojima Productions 10th Anniversary event in Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on-stage during the event, Kojima said development on Physint was just starting. Indeed, the legendary developer is working on the concepts by himself right now, making characters and thinking about casting. “It is just the start,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a video message of support from Herman Hulst, CEO, Studio Business Group, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Kojima described Physint as the next stage tactical espionage action game. Kojima is of course famous for creating the Metal Gear franchise while at Konami.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The tech underpinning Physint is even more advanced than that powering Kojima’s Death Stranding games and upcoming Xbox Game Studios exclusive OD (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-reveals-first-trailer-for-xbox-game-studios-title-od">whose debut trailer was revealed at the show</a>), he said, because it’s due out later in the future. No release date or even release window was mentioned, but from what Kojima said, it’s OD next for Kojima Productions, then Physint, so it may be some time before we see anything meaningful on the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima did tease the main character of the game via the first poster for Physint, below. It doesn’t tell us much, as it’s hard to make out even their face. We don’t know who’s playing the main character, either (expect a casting announcement at some point in the future, Kojima said). We do have the tagline "here comes the feeling," although who knows what that means at this stage?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/23/physint-main-1758606021690.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The debut poster for Physint. Image credit: Kojima Productions.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima did confirm three actors set to appear in Physint, however, each of whom delivered a video message expressing their excitement. Charlee Fraser, who played Mary Jabassa in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga">Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</a>, is in the game, although we don’t know which character she’s playing. Also in the game are Don Lee, who played Gilgamesh in the Marvel movie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/eternals">Eternals</a>, and Japanese actress Minami Hamabe, who played Noriko Ōishi in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/godzilla-minus-one">Godzilla Minus One</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima ended his Physint segment with a shot of Hamabe in CG form, showing off just how realistic the visuals are expected to be. We still don't know which game engine Kojima Productions is using for Physint.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In May, Kojima said Physint was still "another five or six years" away from release, suggesting a launch in 2030 at the earliest, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-hideo-kojimas-return-to-action-espionage-be-one-of-the-first-ps6-games">potentially on PlayStation 6</a>. Kojima told Le Film Francais that his aspirations to direct a movie were on hold at least until he had finished developing his first action espionage game since he <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/19/why-hideo-kojima-left-konami#:~:text=Konami's%20change%20in%20focus%20from,Solid%20V%3A%20The%20Phantom%20Pain."><u>very publicly parted ways with Konami in 2015</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The main character is a guy who sucks.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Beyond the Strand presentation, Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions gave us an official first look at a new animated film set in the world of Death Stranding. It's called Death Stranding: Mosquito and, per Kojima and animation director Hiroshi Miyamoto's own words, it follows the story of a guy who sucks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We got a look at a snippet of animation from Mosquito, showing a man with something stuck to his face that has a weird tentacle thing coming out of it. He's in the water at the beginning of the clip, swimming and approaching something human-shaped that's difficult to make out. But in the second part of the clip, he's on land, in the Timefall, fighting a guy in a porter suit, still with the gooey thing on his face.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's it! Who is this guy, and what does all this mean? No idea! We do find out from a follow-up conversation with Kojima and Miyamoto that the word "Mosquito" refers to the main character, who can suck...something. Not blood! Just something. We'll find out later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also revealed that Mosquito is being animated with hand-drawn lines that are then digitally used to assemble the animation itself. And Studio Easter, which worked on Dandadan, is doing the film's backgrounds. Additionally, Aaron Guzikowksi (Prisoners, Raised by Wolves) will write the scenario script.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the only Death Stranding film we're getting. We also got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-movie-will-tell-a-story-you-havent-seen-in-that-world-director-confirms">new information today</a> about the upcoming A24 Death Stranding movie. And Kojima showed off a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-reveals-first-trailer-for-xbox-game-studios-title-od">new clip of upcoming game OD</a> as well.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Released back in July for the Switch 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> lets you go bananas as Nintendo’s giant ape character Donkey Kong. Players can explore and find goodies by freely punching, smashing and digging their way through bizarre and colorful open-world levels. The game’s quirkiness and fruit-obsession extends to the varied sound effects — many of which were made by the staff themselves. Apparently, a lot of biting and eating was involved…</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recently published interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/50508" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Famitsu</u></a>, Donkey Kong Bananza’s producer Kenta Motokura explained: “The noise you hear when digging is actually the sound of someone eating watermelon. The sound team actually bought watermelons and recorded those sounds.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, apparently this was not exactly a relaxing snack break: “Since they couldn’t do many takes, the recording sessions were apparently very tense,” one of the game’s directors, Wataru Tanaka, revealed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.ndw.jp/dkbananza-interview-250820/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Nintendo Dream Web</u></a>, sound director Naoto Kubo went into even more detail about the level of dedication that went into capturing and manipulating foley sounds to create Donkey Kong Bananza’s satisfying noises.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He noted that the team “recorded a huge variety of (real-life) sounds,” which were then adjusted and readjusted before being added into the game. “We spent years creating things like rock destruction sounds, investing that much time and effort in meticulous adjustments,” Kubo explained, adding that the in-house sound team created all the effects you hear in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza employs a variety of sound effects depending on what you are making Donkey Kong interact with. The sound when you punch watermelons in-game was actually made by smashing actual watermelons. However, Kubo recalled that this was a tough one to get right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“By the time I got around to recording them, summer was already over,” he explained. “There just weren’t any good watermelons left,” adding that he was able to capture the watermelon smashing sound the following year. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island and Emerald Rush DLC Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For the sound effect when you interact with an apple, the team “kept biting into all sorts of things and recording it,” Kubo explained. This included apples, cookies, celery and even hard candies (ouch!). However, in the end they decided that the sound of biting into a real apple was the best. On the other hand, the sound effects for the in-game gold were produced by experimenting with metals brought from a DIY store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other effects were created using a mixture of sounds. The team mixed some of the watermelon-smashing recordings into the sound that plays when you break a hamburger patty in Donkey Kong Bananza, because, as Kubo said, “You don’t get a very good sound when you actually bite into a hamburger patty.” The satisfying “boing” sound that rocks make when you smash through them was likewise created by mixing in a cicada chirp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more in-depth insider info about Donkey Kong Banaza’s development, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-bananas-interview-with-the-developers-of-donkey-kong-bananza"><u>our interview</u></a> with Motokura and Takahashi, and find out why the game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review"><u>scored 10/10 in our review</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions have celebrated the studio's 10th anniversary with a big Beyond the Strand livestream, and it featured everything from the first trailer for OD to a poster and casting details for Physint to a new animation project called Death Stranding: Mosquito to themed credit cards and sake and so much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was a lot discussed and revealed in the two-and-a-half-hour stream, and we're here to gather all the biggest reveals in one place to ensure you don't miss a thing! After you check it out, let us know what your favorite moment was! </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hideo Kojima Reveals First Trailer for Xbox Game Studios Title OD</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During the Beyond the Strand livestream, Hideo Kojima and Xbox head Phil Spencer helped share <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-reveals-first-trailer-for-xbox-game-studios-title-od">the first trailer for OD,</a> Kojima Productions' Xbox Game Studios horror project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The footage begins with an ominous red door and a red card being used to try to unlock it. We then get some redacted text that reads: Ten years since the [REDACTED] Horror [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]." The Cursed [REDACTED] Have Once Again [REDACTED] Into the Forbidden.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We then see the back of the card, which says, "Light the Fires to Celebrate Their [REDACTED] [REDACTED].</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More Text: This Building Was [REDACTED] From a 3D Scan of an [REDACTED] Found in an [REDACTED]. And then, [REDACTED] Were [REDACTED] In a Sinister Ritual.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More gameplay was shown of someone entering a room on a stormy day. There is a shrine of sorts, and the character pulls out a match from a box that says "missing." They then proceed to light candles, including one that looks like a baby. When they light that last one, a baby starts crying. They then light another candle shaped like another young person's head and it starts bleeding. We then see our character, who is played by Honor Among Thieves' Sophia Lillis, and she looks absolutley terrified as something approaches her from behind and then grabs her.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It then cuts to credits and we see OD will star Lillis, Hunters' Udo Kier, and Euphoria's Hunter Schafer. Oh, and that it is for "all players and screamers."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, it looks like OD will have a subtitle of Knock and an exploration of the "fear of the knock." Kojima also noted that Jordan Peele will be focusing on another fear for his OD project, but that fear of the knock will be one of Kojima's focuses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also said he wants to go all around the world to scary places and even "scan a ghost for the first time and get an awards for that." </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hideo Kojima Reveals New Details on PlayStation's Physint</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/23/g1gdnwqaaaaa5o7-1758606163369.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While Kojima said he was still in the conceptual phase and working on characters and stories, he was still able to help share a few new details on his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-reveals-debut-poster-for-playstation-exclusive-physint-first-cast-announcement">upcoming action espionage project for PlayStation called Phyisnt.</a> We started by seeing a poster of Physint with a male character shrouded in darkness and holding a gun. Along with the character who hasn't been revealed yet, we have the words, "Here comes the feeling." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also shared that Charlee Fraser (Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga), Don Lee aka Ma Dong-seok (Eternals), and Minami Hamabe (Godzilla Minus One) will be joining the cast of Physint. To end the segment, he shared a look at Hamabe's character in the game's engine.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Death Stranding: Mosquito Is the Working Title for a New Animation Project, Trailer Revealed</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-shows-off-first-look-at-death-stranding-animated-film-mosquito">Kojima announced Death Stranding: Mosquito,</a> which is the working title for a new animation project from director Hiroshi Miyamoto (ABC Animation Studio) and writer Aaron Guzikowski. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team wants to differentiate the look of the animation film project and the games, and we got to see this in action in a teaser trailer you can see above. It was also revealed the main character, who is not Sam Porter Bridges, will have the ability to "suck something really important" that isn't blood, and that's why they went with the working title of Death Stranding: Mosquito.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also revealed that Death Stranding: Mosquito is being animated in a very unique style that begins with hand-drawn lines that are then digitally used to create the animation itself. The backgrounds of the film are also being done by Studio Easter, who has previously worked on Dandadan.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hideo Kojima Announces AR Project With Pokémon Go Creator Niantic</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/23/g1gspb1auaanuxu-1758610868909.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-announces-ar-project-with-pokmon-go-creator-niantic">Kojima Productions is partnering with Niantic Spatial on a new AR game</a> that aims to "move beyond the screen" and "redefine immersive entertainment." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Niantic Spatial is the new name for Pokemon Go creator Niantic, and this new project that is still very much in the works was described in a bit more detail by Kojima and Niantic Spatial boss John Hanke.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can't really speak about details yet but, if you're climbing a mountain... there's still entertainment there," Kojima teased. "It's like the real Death Stranding in the real world, and you can connect with people, or you can connect with the actual environment there in your city. Previously it was like virtual reality, but this time I'm thinking about connecting with the real environment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I hope that it creates [an environment] that brings people together to play," Hanke said. "If there's one thing need we have in our society right now, it's something that unifies us and doesn't pull us apart. And I think that storytelling... has always been humanity's way of coming together. And technology can support that. It can divide it too, but with an inspiring creator it can be an important force in the world."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kojima and A24 Give a Brief Update on the Death Stranding Movie</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima and A24 took the stage to give a few updates on the upcoming Death Stranding film. The movie's director, Michael Sarnoski, also was on hand to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-movie-will-tell-a-story-you-havent-seen-in-that-world-director-confirms">share a bit about how they are envisioning this adaptation.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With this project we really want to capture the soul of the game, capture the themes of the game, but we also want to tell a story that you haven't seen in that world and explore characters you haven't seen before," Sarnoski said. "Also, we want to find all of that scope and all of those incredible real locations, but also find all of those nuanced characters and just do justice to this on a micro and macro scale."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team wants the film to tell a new story in Death Stranding's world that will be familiar to those who have played the game but also not confusing to those who never have. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kojima Productions Partnering With Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group On a Credit Card</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions are collaborating with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group on a brand-new credit card that is aiming to be released in the second half of 2026. This card will also have a smartphone app and digital card to make payments, and it will let users accumulate points and exchange them for merch and goods. The team is working on what themed goods and merch can be used alongside game characters and themes for the card itself. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kojima Productions and Shimizu Seizaburo Shoten Are Teaming Up for a Zaku Ludens Sake</h2><blockquote data-theme="light">— KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS (Eng) (@KojiPro2015_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1970359826405572730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima is teaming up with Shimizu Seizaburo Shoten to produce a branded sake called Zaku Ludens.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kojima Discusses the 20-Year Plan for Kojima Productions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima discussed a bit more about the 20-year plan he set out for Kojima Productions, and it is very much reminiscent to the building and launching of a spaceship into the stars.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>First Phase (2015-2019)</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Goal:</strong> "Build a spaceship, assemble a crew, install engines, and head for the outer space creating our own new IP."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Details: </strong>This also included Death Stranding, "focusing on connections with fans," merchandising, a fan event, and an anniversary event.
