            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I hope that someone would create it for me."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, the sequel to Hideo Kojima's 2019 hit Death Stranding, was well-received at launch. It's "incredibly exciting and original," and "bold work that deserves to be encouraged," at least, according to our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">review</a>. As a result, fans might be hoping for an eventual third game in the series. But for right now, Kojima isn't planning to make Death Stranding 3...even though he already has a concept written.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima said this in an interview in Riyadh, Saudia Arabia, as a part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/AwQDoD9TK6w" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Death Stranding 2 World Strand Tour</a>. When asked by the interviewer about Death Stranding 3, he replied with the following:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm not planning to do that at the moment, because the ending of Death Stranding 2 was my finale of 1 and 2. But I already wrote the concept of DS3, so I have that in data. I hope that someone would create it for me."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time Kojima has suggested that someone else might pick up the mantle of his games after him. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-creator-hideo-kojima-says-hes-left-his-staff-a-usb-stick-of-ideas-for-after-he-dies-kind-of-like-a-will">Back in May</a>, he said that he'd been thinking more and more about his own death lately, prompting him to create a USB stick "kind of like a will" that lays out the future of his studio, Kojima Productions, if he dies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I gave a USB stick with all my ideas on it to my personal assistant, kind of like a will,” he said. “Perhaps they could continue to make things after I’m gone at Kojima Productions… This is a fear for me: what happens to Kojima Productions after I’m gone? I don’t want them to just manage our existing IP.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we won't be getting a Death Stranding 3 anytime soon it sounds like, there's plenty coming from Kojima's mind in the near future. Death Stranding is getting a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-is-getting-an-anime-adaptation-hideo-kojima-says">live-action film adaptation</a> in partnership with A24, and Kojima is busy working on two different games: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kojimas-od-still-in-development-despite-xbox-game-cancellations">horror project OD</a>, in collaboration with Xbox, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project">Metal Gear successor Physint</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“The advantage of every failure . . . is that people now understand how necessary that [oversight] is.”</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After a high-profile failure in Concord and a high-profile success in Astro Bot last year, PlayStation is looking to adjust its strategy to incorporate fewer live service games, more big franchises, and stricter oversight of its owned studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d5859ffc-c4d7-4480-98a6-c1cff07af299" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Times</a>, PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst says the company is hoping to mitigate future big, expensive risks with future games. “I don’t want teams to always play it safe, but I would like for us, when we fail, to fail early and cheaply.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord was not a cheap failure. Analysts estimate Sony spent around $250m on the game, only for it to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">sell so poorly</a> that Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-wave-goodbye-to-playstation-flop-concord-as-it-goes-dark-maybe-forever">shut it down two weeks after launch</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">shuttered its developer</a>, Firewalk Studios, not long after. By contrast, Astro Bot also launched last year to universal acclaim, winning multiple awards and <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/blog/astro-bot/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">selling 2.3 million copies as of March 2025</a>, one of the best-selling games on PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The differences between the two games are myriad, certainly, and their development stories are quite different as well. But what Hulst has taken away from this is that there needs to be more supervision of Sony's owned studios to ensure that games veering in the direction of Concord are spotted before they become expensive failures, so they can be canceled or corrected in time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have since put in place much more rigorous and more frequent testing in very many different ways,” Hulst said. “The advantage of every failure . . . is that people now understand how necessary that [oversight] is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Financial Times spoke to multiple Sony studio heads, who said that this oversight means more focus on group testing, more communication between internal Sony studios, and closer relationships between the studios' top executives. “If we’re heading towards a giant landmine, like there’s another studio making exactly the same game, that’s good information,” said Jason Connell, art director at Ghost of Yōtei studio Sucker Punch.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That comment rings especially poignant in light of Concord's failure, which analysts say occurred for a number of reasons, including an oversaturation of multiplayer, live service shooters. Hulst suggests in the interview that PlayStation isn't as intent on churning out live service games as it used to be. That said, PlayStation does have Bungie's Marathon coming up before March 2026, a game that has<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-concords-failure-and-marathons-delay-sony-admits-playstations-live-service-strategy-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly"> a number of Bungie fans concerned</a> amid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026">delays</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio">staff layoffs</a>, and a general lack of information as to what the game entails.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there's another strategy Hulst also wants to pursue: he wants more, massive Sony IP. Astro Bot's success has come about over the course of multiple games, with the little robot icon growing in popularity each time. According to Financial Times, Hulst wants studios to be thinking about how their IP can be turned into bigger and bigger franchises over time, following in the footsteps of The Last of Us and Uncharted. “We take a very intentional approach to IP creation . . . understanding how a new concept can turn into an iconic franchise for PlayStation, that can then again become a franchise for people beyond gaming,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently on the docket, PlayStation has Ghost of Yōtei and Lost Soul Aside coming this year, with Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls and Housemarque's Saros for 2026. Other games such as Fairgames, Marvel's Wolverine, Naughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, Marathon, and more remain in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">You can't find these deals at Amazon.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7M7R?object_uuid=e3687668-be38-4145-b9ee-389cae089050&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Best Buy Labor Day sale</a> has officially kicked off, and some of the best deals are on Nintendo Switch games. There aren't any Switch 2 titles on sale here, but there are quite a few discounts on popular Mario games that are rare enough to be of note. According to Best Buy's sale page, these deals will last from now until Monday, September 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a total of four Mario Switch games with $20 discounts right now, as well as one Legend of Zelda game. If you've been hoping to pick up something fun to play ahead of the long weekend, these deals are definitely worth a look. Best Buy is currently offering the best prices on these games, even with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-labor-day-sale-2025">Amazon Labor Day sale</a> going on right now as well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch Games on Sale at Best Buy Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Out of these six games on sale, the one that I'd recommend the most is Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. This is a remake of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door">original GameCube game</a>, and it's fantastic. I played it when it first came out all of those years ago and loved it enough to spend full price on the Switch remake. If you haven't played it before, I highly recommend picking up a copy. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review">IGN's review of this game</a> aligns with my feelings as well, with the reviewer calling it "an amazingly loyal and visually dazzling remake of a treasured RPG."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My second recommendation here is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/19/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a>. This is another remake of a classic game, but it's still quite wonderful. I didn't get the chance to play the original 1993 version, so the Switch remake was my first dip into this story. While it's certainly not as visually stunning as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-zelda-games-on-nintendo-switch">other Legend of Zelda Switch games</a> like Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, it's fun and just challenging enough to hold your attention. Link's Awakening is also eligible for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-games-free-switch-2-upgrade">free Switch 2 upgrade</a>, so it's worth grabbing for the new Nintendo console too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership is currently included in these discounts. While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-and-luigi-brothership-review">IGN's review of this game</a> revealed a pretty disappointing score, I still picked up a copy and played it all the way through. It isn't as good as some of the other Mario &amp; Luigi games that made me fall in love with the series, but it's still quite a bit of fun. It's also the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-mario-games-on-nintendo-switch">latest Mario game for the Switch</a> if you don't count Mario Kart World. I can't say I'd recommend paying full price for it, but with the $20 discount, I think it's worth a look for any Mario fan out there.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">See the full Best Buy Labor Day sale</h3><div catalogid="a264a67f-6640-443b-a515-0079f073a486" id="227277"><div id="227277" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Best Buy Labor Day Sale</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of these Nintendo Switch game deals, Best Buy has a wide range of discounts on other tech items. This includes price cuts on TVs, laptops, phones, Apple products, headphones, and more. You can also save up to 50% on major appliances from there if you're looking to upgrade to a new fridge or washer and dryer.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 25, 2025 5:04 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-nintendo-switch-games-labor-day-sale-2025]]></content:encoded>
