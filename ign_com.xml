            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher Reef Entertainment and developer Bitmap Bureau have published a new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/terminator-2d-no-fate"><u>Terminator 2D: No Fate</u></a> trailer, showing off how next month’s arcade-inspired action game reimagines the events of Terminator 2: Judgment Day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a two-and-a-half-minute look at a modern take on retro gaming that debuted as part of IGN Fall Fan Fest 2025. Director James Cameron’s original ‘90s sequel has been picked apart by movie fans for decades, and Terminator 2D: No Fate aims to let players experience fan-favorite moments – and new scenarios, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Bitmap Bureau lead programmer and designer Mike Tucker explains in today’s trailer, a Terminator 2D: No Fate playthrough begins simply enough, with players tasked with revisiting the events of the Terminator 2 movie through the lens of a 2D, retro side-scroller. That No Fate title then takes over on repeat playthroughs, as fans are given the option to make choices that alter the story they’ve known for years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Secret levels and remixed weapon loadouts are just the tip of the iceberg for Terminator 2D: No Fate. The example we see in today’s IGN Fall Fan Fest 2025 trailer revisits Sarah Connor’s trek through Cyberdyne HQ. Players will first fight through waves of SWAT officers by using little more than Sarah’s pistol and a few well-timed punches. A follow-up playthrough, coupled with different choices, however, could see her use an assault rifle to go in guns blazing while Arnold Schwarzenegger’s T-800 tears through enemies with his minigun.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Terminator 2D: No Fate Steam Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Adding in this pivotal decision the player must make gave us a way of staying accurate to the movie,” Tucker explained, “while also opening up the possibility of new scenarios and gameplay ideas that could make repeat playthroughs both rewarding and entertaining, allowing fans of the franchise to experience battles they have only ever dreamed of before.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-2d-no-fate-delayed-proving-that-not-even-skynet-is-safe-from-tariffs"><u>a recent delay</u></a>, Terminator 2D: No Fate has a release date of November 26, 2025, for PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X | S.

Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Step into the shadows as an acolyte of the Inquisition in Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy, a second narrative-driven tactical RPG set in the beloved grimdark universe. Set against the backdrop of the Noctis Aeterna and the mystery of the Tyrant Star, players will lead a warband of diverse companions in a desperate battle against heresy and corruption — from loyal Imperial subjects, such as a veteran Guardsman from the death world of Catachan, to nefarious xenos, including a bird-like Kroot mercenary.</blockquote><blockquote>With intricate investigations, a turn-based combat system, and choices that carry grave consequences, Dark Heresy is set to deliver an atmospheric dive into the brutality and mysticism of one of the Imperium’s most feared organizations. The game greatly expands on the ideas introduced in Rogue Trader and features fully voiced dialogues.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy is due out on PC (Steam, GOG, Epic Games Store) and PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S.

IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-review">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader review</a> returned an 8/10.

By virtue of their Warrant of Trade, the Rogue Trader is endowed with privileges and power beyond imagination, as well as the task of expanding the borders of the Imperium. A gargantuan voidship of immense strength and innumerable personnel ready to follow their leader without question is at their disposal. Show your subjects mercy or disdain, stay faithful to the Emperor or consort with the enemies of Humanity — the Rogue Trader’s every decision sends ripples across entire star systems, changing the in-game world and those who inhabit it.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not all from Owlcat at IGN Fan Fest, either.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Something Has Survived</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Jurassic World Evolution 3 hits PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 soon, and the team behind the game just revealed a brand-new dinosaur at IGN Fan Fest 2025: Fall Edition. When the game releases in just a few days, players will be able to breed and care for a new dinosaur that up until now has only shown up on the big screen: the Therizinosaurus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Therozinosaurus previously appeared in the 2022 movie Jurassic World Dominion. I spoke exclusively with the team behind Jurassic World: Evolution 3 to break down why they consider the new dinosaur a pivotal addition to the franchise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Therizinosaurus is a key franchise dinosaur now,” says Andy Fletcher, Game Director for Jurassic World Evolution 3. “Our narrative for our campaign begins shortly after Dominion. So it certainly makes sense for us to include that dinosaur at that point in the Jurassic timeline. It’s a unique dinosaur. It's very, very high appeal for your parks and your guests, but it's not the easiest to look after. It doesn't act too well with other species. We also thought with the advent of dinosaur families and the relationship between juveniles and adults (it would be an) interesting element of that particular dinosaur to explore."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Senior designer Sandro Sammarco says “It’s big, it's scary, it's got those horrific looking claws. But because it's a relatively independent and powerful dinosaur, the parents want to protect it, but they don't really care about it that much.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s those dinosaur families that serve as a key element of Jurassic World Evolution 3. For the first time, players can breed dinosaurs and look after entire groups of both adults and juveniles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've got a core mechanic that when you look after (the juveniles), the better they're treated, the better their welfare, the more appeal they retain as an adult,” Sammarco says. “The guests appreciate the welfare of dinosaurs being looked after. So it means that you have to look after the Therizinosaurus as a family unit. You can't just care about (the juvenile), which is quite an interesting facet.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the Therizinosaurus, Fletcher and Sammarco revealed that the very first level of Jurassic World Evolution 3 will feature another new dinosaur and a familiar (yet new to the games) location for Jurassic fans. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Lokiceratops is one of our new additions in Jurassic World Evolution 3,” Fletcher says. “It’s a recently-discovered dinosaur. It's got a distinct large frill that we really can't wait to see. It was found in Montana, which is the opening level of our campaign. And indeed, that's the first dinosaur family you'll see in Jurassic World Evolution 3.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond Montana, players will get to visit a variety of new locations in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can go all across the world to new locations that even the franchise hasn't been to before (like) China and Japan,” Fletcher says. “It's a great, globetrotting campaign bigger than any of our ones before. (In) the original novel there was a plan for a Jurassic Park Europe, which was intended to be built on the Azores islands. So one of our levels takes place on the Azores. And the assignment there is to realize the vision of John Hammond back from those early days, and being enlisted to help with that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As anticipation builds for the game, the team behind Jurassic World Evolution 3 is on pins and needles waiting to see how fans will react both to the new dinosaurs and new mechanics in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm really excited and interested to see how players are going to interact with dinosaurs no longer as monolithic blocks,” Sammarco says. “It's no longer, ‘oh, this is the T-Rex enclosure with the T-Rex.’ Now it's here are the T-Rexes. And they could be males, they could be females. They could be juveniles. How do they get along? What are your cohabitation potentials and what are the challenges that come along with that? We've got these dinosaur simulation brains that are working that out. And because there are so many dinosaurs, there are so many combinations, it's going to be intriguing to work out to see what players try to do and see what the results are of that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jurassic World Evolution 3 is available to play on October 21. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-new-dinosaur-revealed-ign-fall-fan-fest-2025]]></content:encoded>

It’s…creepy, to say the least, with Red Barrels prepping its PvP experience for Halloween with a release date of October 21, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X | S.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“You are not your brother’s keepers: you are your father’s children,” an official story description for The Outlast Trials Invasion Mode says. “And a father gains the trust of his children by trusting them himself. That’s why the ever-gracious Easterman has provided his beloved children with the tools they need to truly sympathize with one another: knives, security cameras, and disguises made of human flesh. After all, sometimes you have to hurt the ones you love to help them get better… and in the world of The Outlast Trials, harm and healing always go hand-in-hand.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Outlast Trials launched in early access in 2023 as a PvE spin on Red Barrels’ green-tinted survival horror video game series, with its full launch following in 2024. It’s remained in that space since then, so the Invasion Experimental Therapy mode should shake things up more than ever before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can access the mode via the Sleep Room Terminals, where they are given the option between playing as a Reagent or an Imposter. Like so many other asymmetrical horror games, those Imposter spots are limited, but their impact can’t be overstated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Imposters stick to the shadows and essentially serve as mimics in The Outlast Trials Invasion Mode, hunting other players by using surveillance cameras and tricky, fleshy disguises until the time to strike arrives. Red Barrels says Imposters will then engage in close-quarters combat with multiple knife strikes or a single stab attack.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Outlast Trials October Update First Look Images | IGN Fall Fan Fest 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">True stealth is key for killers looking to dispatch other players in The Outlast Trials Invasion Mode, but other gameplay opportunities will be introduced with that major Season 4 update. Also on the way is the Geister time-limited event and time-limited catalog, as well as two new MK Challenges – Beguile the Children and Investigate the Minotaur – and a new in-game store.

But the explosive creatures probably wouldn't be included today, the developer has said, if it were to design them from scratch now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking in a new developer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBTJIYzJDJw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> discussing game balance and fairness, chief creative officer Jens Bergensten said that Mojang now followed a strong principle when adding any new item, biome or enemy to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> that could cause players grief. In a nutshell, if anything causes the player to suffer, it should be because players brought it on themselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want to avoid treating players in a way that feels unfair," Bergensten said. "So we have this guiding principle that bad things [can] happen, but they're technically the players' fault. What we mean by that is either the player caused it, or the player had a chance to prevent it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That means enemies have to feel fair — so players can choose to take them on if they want or have a decent chance of mitigating the danger if not. Situations that negatively impact a player should also never feel too random.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bergensten listed various examples of things that have been added in the past that haven't felt as fair as intended — such as Iron Golems protecting villages by attacking Creepers (and getting said villages blown up), or Endermen randomly stealing blocks that could have some pivotal signifiance (such as a painstakingly-built Redstone circuits).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This doesn't mean that Mojang won't add in tougher challenges, though the developer said it was now careful to make difficult content feel like something players were opting into — such as when actively making the choice to enter The End and take on the game's climactic Ender Dragon. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/15/the-biome-that-broke-minecraft-00-05-53-1760547479174.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mojang chief creative officer Jens Bergensten.

It can be encountered from the very beginning of the game, it can instantly kill players and destroy builds, and it sometimes feels like it appears at random.
