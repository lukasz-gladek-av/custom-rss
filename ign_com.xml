But it's also hoping to stand out to avoid "clone" comparisons to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake"><u>Silent Hill 2</u></a>, and appeal to younger players by racheting up the combat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto and Silent Hill f director Al Yang have been making the rounds just recently, and an interview has popped up at <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/08/01/155659.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game*Spark</u></a>. Okamoto discussed that whilst his aims for the remake of Silent Hill 2 were to respect the source material, for f, he's interested in "more entertaining and thrilling action."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Inserting more entertaining and thrilling action into Silent Hill f was an idea I had ever since the early phases of the development," Okamoto said, as transcribed by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/silent-hill-f-features-more-action-gameplay-to-avoid-being-a-silent-hill-2-clone-but-also-to-appeal-to-younger-audiences-producer-says/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"And, since NeoBards is a company that’s tremendously good at making action games, this is also one of the reasons why we decided to choose them as the developers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Silent Hill series isn’t considered a game that has entertaining action per se, but as we’re opening our doors to new players, we began to wonder what it would be like if we added more of those elements into the game.” Okamoto added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Challenging action games are gaining popularity among younger players nowadays, so I believed that if we implemented such elements into the game, it would resonate well even with people who are new to the series."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yang added: "We didn’t want to end up recreating Silent Hill 2 over and over again, and we were aware that there was no reason to keep making clones of it. So, in order to avoid repeating what previous major titles did, we decided to make the action stand out more."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f is not a sequel to any of the existing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/silent-hill"><u>Silent Hill games</u></a>. Instead, it will offer a standalone story "independent from the series." That came from publisher Konami itself, which finally confirmed on X/Twitter that the latest instalment of the horror series — which is usually, if not always, based in a sleepy resort town on east-coast America — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-a-completely-new-title-that-people-who-have-never-played-the-series-can-enjoy-konami-says"><u>will be "a completely new title" that "people who have never played the Silent Hill series can enjoy</u></a>."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Silent Hill f Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-combat-has-a-heavier-focus-on-melee-and-is-more-action-oriented-than-silent-hill-2-remakes-producer-says"><u>Okamoto said that tougher combat</u></a>, with the visuals and music's "juxtaposition between beauty and terror," along with the "terrible beauty of the game’s monster design," makes for a terrifying adventure. Even the puzzles are apparently "grounded in psychological anguish and suffering."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Higurashi and When They Cry creator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-writer-ryukishi07-says-his-story-is-a-salad-dressing-of-supernatural-and-psychological-horror"><u>Ryukishi07 also recently opened up about writing Silent Hill f, likening the game's supernatural and psychological elements to, uh, "salad dressing."</u></a> The writer explained that it would initially be difficult for players to distinguish between the game's supernatural and psychological horror motifs, as they'll often feel like one and the same. As the game progresses, however, players will understand more of what's going on —and it's here that the game "will be like a salad dressing", he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f takes us to 1960s Japan, where we'll follow Hinako Shimizu, a teenager struggling under the pressure of expectations from her friends, family, and society.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"It'll be worth it though."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> is two years old, and to celebrate Larian boss Swen Vincke has briefly discussed how its enormous success paved the way for the studio to work on its hotly anticipated next game. But don’t hold your breath for a reveal: Vincke called on fans to be patient as Larian "need a bit of time to make it all work."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game Baldur’s Gate 3 was a breakout hit in 2023, dominating online conversation and setting sales records. Its wild success was a game-changer for Larian, and it has continued to perform strongly in the two years since launch, with mods helping to fuel seemingly never-ending interest in the RPG, especially on Steam.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke told IGN in September 2024 that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-one-year-later-larian-interview"><u>the success of Baldur’s Gate 3 meant Larian was now in a “luxurious position,”</u></a> and could “pick our own destiny and our own path.” The developer shocked the video game world when it announced plans to make brand new games outside the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe, rather than follow Baldur’s Gate 3 with DLC or a sequel. It is now hard at work realizing that vision, Vincke said in a tweet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Crazy to think it’s only been two years,” he said. “It’s truly been life changing. Probably worth writing about one day. But I can spoil the biggest takeaway. BG3 was what allowed us to do our next crazy thing. How that will pan out is anyone’s guess but I can assure you we’re working hard to ensure you’ll have plenty of fun. Like really — loads of it. In a surprising way. And I can’t wait to show you. But you’ll need to be patient / we’ll need a bit of time to make it all work. It’ll be worth it though.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Crazy to think it’s only been two years. It’s truly been life changing.

Its release sparked a player surge as fans flocked to test out the new subclasses as well as the brand new photo mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1914637297946931379" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a> to say he expected Baldur’s Gate 3 to “continue to do well for quite some time,” not just because of the Patch 8 player boost, but because of “thriving” mod support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538860954058754131" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on Steam</a> issued today, August 4, Larian said that since the introduction of mod support in September 2024, players have uploaded over 8,500 mods to mod.io and hit 265 million mod downloads ("of which, over 250,000 of all downloads are Withers Big Naturals by the way - we just thought you’d like to know"). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This ongoing success in turn gives Larian “room to focus on making our next big thing as good as we can,” Vincke continued. “We’ve got big shoes to fill.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN 10 of 2023</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian is done with Baldur's Gate, but D&amp;D owner Hasbro has teased plans to continue with the series. Speaking to IGN at the Game Developers Conference, SVP of digital games at Hasbro, Dan Ayoub, let on that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated"><u>with Larian moving on</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says"><u>Hasbro has "a lot of people very interested in Baldur's Gate."</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that," Ayoub said. "And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ayoub didn't offer any further information about whether this "stuff" would be a full-blown new Baldur's Gate in the works, or some sort of crossover like the characters had with Magic: The Gathering previously. However, he did acknowledge that he eventually <em>wants</em> a Baldur's Gate 4, even if making one will likely take a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's somewhat of an unenviable position," he said. "I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach... We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
