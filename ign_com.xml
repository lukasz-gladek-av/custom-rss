            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-patch-221-adds-dlss-4-on-pc-and-additional-fixes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt has announced that patch 2.21 for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077"><u>Cyberpunk 2077</u></a> is rolling out to players on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. The brunt of the changes are largely fixes for photo mode, as well as DLSS 4 support for PC players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-patch-22-fully-revealed-and-its-out-now"><u>patch 2.2</u></a> added a much deeper look at customization in photo mode, 2.21 adds heaps of fixes for the mode. One of the most notable is the ability to finally save characters and V’s rotation and position within your Photo Mode presets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also fixes present for “texture and color inconsistencies for vehicles that have CrystalCoat applied,” in addition to several other menu fixes for the vehicle customization system added in patch 2.11.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those looking at creating a character in future runs, you can now also preserve randomizer settings within the character creator after further customization of character attributes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also a handful of changes to allow Johnny Silverhand to appear more in the passenger seat of your car if you’re ever feeling lonely while driving along the streets of Dogtown. Patch 2.2 originally sought to resolve this by having Johnny sitting shotgun around 25% of the time, which didn’t happen. The inverse also occurred, where Johnny could appear duplicated in the passenger seat in quests where he is set to appear during a scripted event. The new patch will solve any ghostly duplications of Silverhand, and have him spend more time with V in a car this time around.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.1</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Most notably, the game has also added DLSS 4 support for PC players, as well as Multi Frame Generation for RTX 50-series GPUs. This tool will now allow players to boost their FPS by “up to three times per traditionally rendered frame,” so long as you have the new GPUs to run it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">RTX 40-series users can also enjoy “faster single frame generation with reduced memory usage." All Nvidia RTX GPU owners can also choose between the traditional CNN model in DLSS features to the new Transformer model, which CD Projekt claimed can enhance “stability, lighting, and detail in motion." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">RTX users can also enjoy enhanced Ray Reconstruction, with fewer artifacts and smudging in patch 2.21. CD Projekt has not announced whether or not this might be a final update to Cyberpunk 2077, as the company transitions to full development on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-enters-full-scale-production-cyberpunk-2077-hits-30-million-copies-sold"><u>The Witcher 4</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cyberpunk 2077 update 2.21 patch notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 2.21 for Cyberpunk 2077 is being rolled out on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This update adds support for DLSS 4 on PC and introduces various fixes, notably to SmartFrames on Xbox and Photo Mode across all platforms.
