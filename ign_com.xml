            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">You ever wake up and think it'll be a normal day only to discover that literally everything you thought you knew about reality is wrong? That's what happened to <em>me</em> today when I woke up, sat down to work, and then read a post stating that Mario and Peach are apparently "good friends" as opposed to, I dunno, anything else I might have thought they were to one another.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>"Princess Peach and Mario are good friends and help each other out whenever they can."</p><p>Via: Nintendo Today app. <a href="https://t.co/IsyQqe2KLz" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/IsyQqe2KLz</a></p></div>— Kābī (@KirPinkFury) <a href="https://twitter.com/KirPinkFury/status/1948141191440286122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">This aggravating discovery comes from the Nintendo Today app. The post that originally included this information is now gone due to the app's regularly updating, but has since been preserved in several spots including by <a href="https://x.com/KirPinkFury/status/1948141191440286122" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter user @KirPinkFury</a>, who originally surfaced it online. The post, which was a profile on Princess Peach, included the sentence, "Princess Peach and Mario are good friends and help each other out whenever they can." Good friends, you say? What about all those times they definitely smooched?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look," you might say, "they could be good friends and in a relationship. It's important to be friends with the person you love also." Sure, you're correct. But who's describing a relationship like that? I don't go around referring to my husband as my "good friend". That would probably confuse several people, including him! The only conclusion I can come to here is that Nintendo is trying to distance Mario and Peach from the previous very, very, very direct ways in which it indicated they were, at minimum, romantically interested.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo admittedly has been deeply inconsistent about this over the years. Peach has been referred to as Mario's "special someone," they've been shown on multiple occasions to have some level of romantic interest in one another. Nintendo's Yoshiaki Koizumi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190822105931/https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2017/06/17/marios-developers-on-hat-capture-and-peachs-love-for-mario.aspx?amp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has directly said in an interview</a> before that Mario "carries a torch" for Peach. Nintendo celebrated them as a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/434371505024409600" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">romantic couple, pink hearts and all</a>, for Valentine's Day at least once. And Mario even tried to propose to her at the end of Super Mario Odyssey. Though she refused at the time, she had also just gone through a wild ordeal with Bowser where he tried to kidnap her and force her into marrying <em>him. </em>If I had just been kidnapped into an attempted forced marriage and then rescued and my boyfriend tried to propose to me the second I was rescued, I'd probably tell him to take a hike too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But whatever! I guess they're just friends or something. Just like Link and Zelda, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tears-of-the-kingdom-hints-that-link-and-zelda-are-finally-in-a-relationship">two characters who live together and definitely sleep in the same bed</a>. Next they're going to try and tell me there's nothing going on between all those people in Fire Emblem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone who's wanted to run through <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> with just their trusted duos partner is getting their wish. FromSoftware <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWqBTAYa8h4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed today</a> that a two-player Duo Expeditions mode will arrive in Elden Ring Nightreign Patch 1.02.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The patch will arrive on July 30, allowing just two Nightfarers to embark on expeditions to strike down the Nightlords together. Before now, the only options were to either head out on a solo expedition or team up with two others for a trio.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Duos has been a hotly requested feature, as it there seems to be a solid contingent of players who'd like to play with just one other person. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players">Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki previously said</a> the two-player mode was something that was "overlooked" during development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the wake of Elden Ring Nightreign's launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-duo-expeditions-on-the-way-fromsoftware-confirms-as-sales-jump-to-35-million">FromSoftware committed to adding Duo Expeditions</a> as a mode. And now, several weeks later, the option is finally ready. I imagine this should be a nice option for playing with your pals and loved ones, without the need to add a random third to the mix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 1.02 also brings a few other updates in the quality-of-life department, including more filtering options for your Relic pool. Considering players probably have a hefty amount of Relics at this point (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-player-discovers-theres-a-maximum-number-of-relics-you-can-store">hopefully not too many</a>), the added sorting options should be nice too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The eager duos and everyone else queuing up will have some tough fights ahead of them too, as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-will-start-rolling-out-more-enhanced-bosses-at-the-end-of-july">next Everdark cycle spins up at the end of July</a>. Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast, and the Fissure in the Fog are all set to receive their enhanced Everdark Sovereign fights starting July 31. Solos, duos, and trios alike should have a good time learning these bouts, if the past few Everdark Sovereigns are any indication.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's good to see this particular playstyle finally get accomodated, and considering it's been a little under two months since Nightreign launched, it didn't take that long either. It's certainly been intriguing to watch FromSoftware work on a live service-oriented game like Elden Ring Nightreign, and considering <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-will-get-dlc-bosses-and-characters-according-to-steam-page-slip-up">the potential for DLC down the road</a>, I'm betting there's still more to see in the Lands Between.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-finally-gets-its-two-player-duos-mode-on-july-30]]></content:encoded>
