            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It's dangerous to go alone, take these!</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Day is still going on until this Friday, July 11, and there are countless great deals available in a wide variety of categories. There happens to be a significant amount of Legend of Zelda-related items in these sales, so I've gathered some of the best and put together a little Prime Day gift guide for that Zelda fan in your life. Amazon has everything from games, books, and apparel on sale, so Hyrule is your oyster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the Prime Day deals don't quite have what you're looking for, be sure to check out the <a href="https://store.ign.com/collections/the-legend-of-zelda" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN Store for more awesome Legend of Zelda gift ideas</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Some of the Best Legend of Zelda Gifts to Grab During Prime Day</h2><p id="video-games"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Video Games">Legend of Zelda Video Games</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the Legend of Zelda video games are the bread and butter, and we wouldn't have any of these other snazzy gifts without them. While the discounts on these aren't as steep as I'd like, it's never a bad time to experience Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom for the first time. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is the highest discounted of the bunch at 15% off, and I highly recommend it if you enjoy the classic top-down 2D style like I do. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Breath of the Wild and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/Everything_New_In_Zelda:_Tears_of_the_Kingdom_Switch_2">Tears of the Kingdom both have Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades available</a>, so if it's your first time dipping your toes into these masterpieces and you have the snazzy new handheld-hybrid console, you won't be disappointed. There are also quite a few <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-amazon-prime-day-switch-game-deals-2025">other Switch games on sale</a> if you're looking outside of Hyrule for games to play.</p><p id="books"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Books">Legend of Zelda Books</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of Prime Day is a buy 2, get 1 free promotion on dozens of physical media. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-books-are-heavily-discounted-for-prime-day">A handful of Zelda books are included in this at a discount</a>, so if you've had your eye on these, you can bundle and save for some great coffee table books. Of note, while the Legend of Zelda Encyclopedia is sitting at 55% off, it isn't included in the buy 2, get 1 free sale like Hyrule Historia and Art &amp; Artifacts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then you have the Legend of Zelda manga series, covering the stories from most of the games like Twilight Princess and Ocarina of Time. Another odd selection of these is included in buy 2, get 1 free, but the box sets of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-legend-of-zelda-books-and-manga">entire library of Zelda manga</a> is still discounted for Prime Day. Check them out below.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Legend of Zelda Manga Box Sets</h3><h3 data-cy="title3">Buy 2 Legend of Zelda Books, Get 1 Free</h3><h2 data-cy="title2">The Legend of Zelda Animated Series</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You're likely familiar with the "well excuuuuuuse me, Princess" meme at this point. It originated in the incredibly cheesy and campy animated series from the 80's. Luckily for us, the complete series on DVD is on sale during Prime Day and qualifies for the buy 2, get 1 free promotion. You can save an additional 10% off the already discounted 43% with the attached coupon. </p><div id="224816" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="c8b15a1e-0046-45e0-9af2-fe6f733c05d1"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Legend of Zelda - The Complete Series (DVD)</h3></p></div><p id="apparel"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apparel">The Legend of Zelda Apparel</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We all love a good graphic tee, and the Legend of Zelda selection is pretty good. There are countless styles, sizes, and colors available and discounted for Prime Day, but here are some of my favorites. The Retro Kanji Link Portrait is an awesome recreation of the classic Link design and goes with any style. These are all 30% off, so if you've been looking to upgrade your wardrobe with awesome nerdy shirts Prime Day has you covered. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Other Great The Legend of Zelda Gifts</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are countless cool gifts to pick from, it really was hard to narrow down this list without making it too extensive. Below are some more of my favorite things I'd actually get for my home office, light the heart container light and the Majora's Mask LED neon sign. The ceramic ocarina actually works and comes with a song book with music from the games, as well as an easy explainer for how to play it. These are going for between 20% to 42% off for certain items and make great additions to bookshelves, desks, what have you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.
