            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox is once again hosting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-announces-xbox-tokyo-game-show-2025-broadcast-for-later-in-september-heres-what-to-expect">a Tokyo Game Show broadcast in 2025,</a> and this time it's happening today, September 25, at 3am PT/6am ET/11am BST/7pm JST. While we don't know exactly what will be featured in the show, Microsoft did share that it will "feature titles from our creative teams, alongside exciting updates from our partners in Japan, across Asia and around the world."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter what they announce, we will be right here covering all the biggest moments live, so we encourage you to keep checking back to ensure you don't miss any of the reveals, trailers, gameplay, and more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Forza Horizon 6 Speeds to Japan in 2026</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox's Tokyo Game Show ended with our first look at Forza Horizon 6, which is actually located in Japan and will be released in 2026. While we didn't get to see actual cars in the open world, we were given a glimpse of a beautiful vista featuring Mount Fuji after a few fun nods to the series' past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For a long time, Japan has been top of Horizon fans’ wish lists, so we’re excited to finally be bringing this much-requested location to players in <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>,” explains art director Don Arceta to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>. “Japan has such a unique culture – from cars, to music, to fashion – that make it perfect for the next Horizon setting. As with any Horizon title, we want to make sure we do the country justice in terms of authentic representation and Horizon open world playability – and now is the right time to realize that fully for players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team also shared that the technical side of the equation is now in the right place to bring this vision to life, and they even gave the example of Forza Horizon 5's Hot Wheels DLC, which helped the team develop the elevated roads of Tokyo City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for where else Forza Horizon 6 will take us, the team isn't quite ready to share any more locations. However, they did give us a small tease.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While we’re not announcing too much in terms of detail right now, we’re excited to show fans the true breadth of beauty – both natural and urban environments – that Japan has to offer,” explains Arceta. “From the neon lights and towering buildings of Tokyo City – one of our most detailed and layered environments to date – to the serenity and natural beauty of Japan’s rural and mountain areas, we think players will be blown away by the open world of Japan that we have built."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Japan also has a long and storied history with cars, and Playground Games is doing all it can to honor that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In Japanese car culture, the depth and diversity is astonishing,” Cultural consultant Kyoko Yamashita said. “Kei cars and vans with cult followings, precision motorsport, drifting’s roots, and their passion for customization really stands out. It’s welcoming to different levels of enthusiasm and knowledge, which is exactly the kind of layered world I want players to feel.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And of course Forza Horizon 6 will have changing seasons, which will all pay homage to Japan's "sweltering summers, snowy winters and, of course, the iconic Sakura season, those precious weeks where cherry blossoms bloom across the country."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The team has also been able to build a system where seasonal changes truly inform the world – how spring, summer, autumn, and winter subtly shift tone, activity, and sound,” explains Yamashita. “The team is also really proud of the attention to everyday details: ambient audio like station chimes or summer wind bells that instantly place you without a caption. Those are quiet choices, but they carry a lot of truth.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">007: First Light Casts Eternals' Gemma Chan as Dr. Selina Tan</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">007: First Light not only was featured during the stream with quick looks at gameplay, but we were also introduced to MI6's Head of Tactical Simulation, Gemma Chan's Dr. Selina Tan. For those unfamiliar, Chan has previously been seen in Eternals, Raya and the Last Dragon, and Crazy Rich Asians.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Selina oversees a cutting-edge program designed to test and refine the skills of MI6’s most promising recruits," the official description reads of the brand-new character. "With her background in psychology, strategy, and immersive technologies, she is as formidable as she is innovative."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ninja Gaiden 4 Gameplay Overview Features Master Ninja Difficulty Action and Training Mode</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of its release on October 21, Ninja Gaiden took center stage at Xbox's TGS stream to showcase not only its training mode that will let you practice combos and weapons in a safe place, but also its Master Ninja mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlocked after beating Story Mode, Master Ninja will challenge players with feature late-game enemies in earlier chapters, enhanced AI, a greater number of enemies at once, and much more. For those looking for an even greater challenge, there is a setting called Death Wish mode where "growth elements are reset, and difficulty can be escalated towards an even harsher extreme." </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection Gets a Story Trailer, First Two Monster Hunter Stories Games Headed to Xbox in November</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A new story trailer was revealed for Monster Hunter Stories 3: Reflection, and it was also revealed that the original Monster Hunter Stories and Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin will be headed to Xbox Series X/S on November 14, 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bruce Lee Is Joining Hitman: World of Assassination as Your Partner</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The legendary Bruce Lee is joining Hitman: World of Assassination as 47's partner "against the Dragon" later today. 47 will need to identify threats and protect Bruce Lee and work together with him to bring down this threat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lee will play a character named Agent Lee, a character trying to infiltrate the Concorn Union in Hong Kong. The mission, called The Infiltrator, will take place at the Himmapan Hotel in Bangkok, where the Concord Union is hosting a secret international martial arts tournament. Agent Lee needs to win this tournament and identify the leader of the Concorn Union, and he needs 47 to help him do so. There will even be new mechanics to help 47 be the ultimate protector, which is a change from his usual missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Infiltrator will be available from September 25 - November 20.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024's World Update 20 Is Out Today and Adds a Lot of Detail to Japan Locations</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024's World Update 20 is out today and adds a ton of detail to locations in Japan, including Mount Fuji, Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park, Naruto's Otsuka Museum of Art, the Port of Kobe, Osaka Castle, Kyoto, Todaiji Temple, and so many more. In total, there are 23 areas of interest and 67 points of interest to explore, five new airports, more immersive missions, and it's all free.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and the update will also add Local Legend #22: NAMC YS-11 for players to fly.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gungrave Gore Blood Heat Lets You Dualwield Guns and Use a Massive One As a Weapon <em>and</em> a Shield</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Gunegrave Gore Blood Heat is a remake of 2022's Gungrave Gore and its "newly added systems preserve the legacy while delivering a modern and more explosive feel." These updates will be felt in level design, motion, visuals, player interactions, combat system, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yes, you'll be playing as Beyond the Grave, who was once known as Brandon Heat, and will have full access to his dual Cerberus pistols and the gigantic Death Hauler that can be used as a weapon and a shield.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-microsoft-tokyo-game-show-september-2025-everything-announced]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Microsoft has now formally announced Forza Horizon 6 during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-microsoft-tokyo-game-show-september-2025-everything-announced">today's big Xbox Tokyo Game Show broadcast</a> and revealed that it will release first for PC and Xbox console, before then arriving on PlayStation 5 "post-launch".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The teams at Playground Games and Turn 10 have poured their hearts into Forza Horizon 6, bringing Japan to life like never before," said Xbox exec Matt Booty, finally making the game's reveal official.  "This has been the most-requested location since the very first game and we can't wait to share more next year."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s Japan. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ForzaHorizon6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ForzaHorizon6</a> <a href="https://t.co/D6HngHj43g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/D6HngHj43g</a></p>— Forza Horizon (@ForzaHorizon) <a href="https://twitter.com/ForzaHorizon/status/1971165411119943871?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">An <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a> blog post on the game's announcement goes into more detail on why Japan has been chosen now specifically, with art director Don Arceta revealing that recent technical advances had made the game possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The beauty of Horizon games is that each one gives us learnings and ways to make the next even bigger and better," Arceta said. "As well as taking player feedback into account, we’ve also been able to lean into more practical things – for instance, the Forza Horizon 5 Hot Wheels DLC has helped us develop the elevated roads of Tokyo City in FH6.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As evidenced from today's teaser, the game will mix Tokyo's urban environment with a sample of Japan's rural areas, including Mount Fuji. The series' usual seasonal changes will also return, Arceta confirmed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ORIGINAL STORY:</strong> Forza Horizon 6, the next entry in Microsoft's racing series, will be set in Japan and launch in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft made the announcement via a post on Instagram, which has gone live several hours before today's big Xbox Tokyo Game Show broadcast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The post shows a brief teaser for Forza Horizon 6, confirming its setting and release year. "The Horizon Festival is heading to Japan," reads a caption. "Coming 2026. Wishlist now!" Logos confirm the game will be an Xbox Play Anywhere title, and unsurprisingly also launch on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While today's announcement looks to have gone live a little early, nothing from today's announcement comes as much of a surprise. Microsoft gaming chief <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-teases-return-of-halo-in-2026-and-its-reportedly-a-halo-combat-evolved-remaster">Phil Spencer previously confirmed a fresh entry in the Forza series would launch in 2026</a>, and with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-motorsport-team-is-no-more-former-developer-claims-with-remaining-turn-10-staff-left-to-support-the-horizon-side">Forza Motorsport's team reportedly gutted in the company's recent layoffs</a>, it seemed obvious this referred to a fresh Forza Horizon entry instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Forza fans have also had their eye on Japan for a while, as well — particularly after a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-location-leaked-by-car-import-company-fans-believe">teasing social media post last month from a car import company</a> connected to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
