It’s an ideal way to kickstart a collection, offering two Starter Decks that are playable right out of the box, as well as four additional booster packs and a Mickey Mouse Pirate Captain promo card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s an ideal combo because when you want to upgrade your decks with fresh cards, you already have packs to rip open. The decks included are fun ones, too, with the unlikely duo of Peter Pan and the Dalmatians helming one, and Moana and Scrooge McDuck in the other. Each deck contains a booster pack, too, so you’re really getting six in total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Lorcana now rotates sets. This set isn’t currently standard legal - so competitive players should look elsewhere. Thankfully, though, it remains a fantastic deal for collectors or casual players looking to learn the ropes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of writing, the Into the Inklands bundle has gone past the ‘50% claimed’ mark, so you’ll want to move swiftly!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Lorcana Black Friday Deals </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for more Lorcana?

It’s a scheduled test period for anyone wondering if the new Battlefield is worth it, following what EA has called the most successful launch in the FPS shooter franchise’s history.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are extremely proud of what our amazing teams at Battlefield Studios have accomplished and tremendously excited about the community’s passion as we continue to build <em>Battlefield </em>for and with our fans,” general manager of Battlefield Byron Beede said in a statement. “Today’s launch of a free trial for Battlefield 6 is the perfect opportunity for new players to have the All Out Warfare experience that millions of players around the world are raving about.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As detailed in <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-season-1-free-trial-details-tips-and-tricks" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post from EA</a>, the Battlefield 6 free trial week offers three playlists for new players: Initiation Breakthrough, Close Quarters Battle, and All-Out Warfare. The first is meant to ease newcomers into the entry’s destructive gameplay with 48-player matches mixed with real-world people and bots. Close Quarters Combat focuses on fast-paced gunplay in smaller maps with Team Deathmatch and Sabotage modes. Finally, All-Out Warfare presents Battlefield 6 multiplayer unrestricted, giving free trial players access to Conquest, Escalation, and Breakthrough modes on the biggest maps it has.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The free trial isn’t quite the full Battlefield 6 Season 1 experience, but it does give players a chance to try out its core gameplay without leaping into a $69.99 purchase (or a little <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-deal-ps5-xbox-black-friday-2025"><u>cheaper if you act fast</u></a>).

Additional progress made during the trial will also carry over to the full experience, should a player choose to purchase the full game. Those who log in to either experience by November 30 also gain access to the free long-range Lethal Force Weapon Package.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X | S October 10, 2025.

It’ll only be available for four days though, from 9 a.m. ET on November 28 to 11 p.m. ET on December 1, so you’ll need to act fast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If this is your first time hearing about TCGplayer, it’s an online marketplace that specializes in trading cards. There are listings from thousands of sellers across tons of different card games. As you could probably guess, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/3383147/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Magic: The Gathering</u></a> has a big presence, including recent collaborations with <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/3383153/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Avatar: The Last Airbender</u></a> and <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/3383155/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Final Fantasy</u></a>. There are also tens of thousands of listings for Pokémon cards, both in <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/3383158/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>English</u></a> and <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/3383161/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Japanese</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s games like <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/3383165/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Yu-Gi-Oh!</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/3383168/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Digimon</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/3383170/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Cardfight Vanguard</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/3383172/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Flesh and Blood</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/3383173/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Disney Lorcana</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/3383174/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>One Piece</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/3383175/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Dragon Ball Super</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/3383179/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Star Wars Unlimited</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/3383182/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Riftbound</u></a>, and that’s just scratching the surface. We’re not going to list all of them here, it would take forever. But there are dozens of different games available; if you’re a collector of a particular game, chances are good you can find it on TCGplayer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s an in-depth filtering system that will allow you to get very specific about what you’re looking for, and those filters change depending on what product line you pick. For example, when you choose Pokémon, the other filters will change to target specific Pokémon card categories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So you can select things like holofoil or reverse holofoil, shiny rares, first edition, etc. And you can pick card types, like trainer, energy, or stadium. Or target specific sets, like World Championship Decks, Prismatic Evolutions, or Paldean Fates. You can make selections across all these categories at the same time and find only the cards that fit your filters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you only have one specific card in mind, you can always skip that whole process and just type it into the search bar. Or you can get sealed products like bundles or booster packs, which are particularly nice if you’re building a deck for the first time or if you just like the mystery box appeal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However you get there, once you find a listing you’re interested in, you can click on it to find more information about the item itself and who it’s available to buy from. You can see product details, market price history, and all the listings and prices that are currently available. Listings will show their seller, and you can click on them to see how many sales they’ve made, where they’re located, and the reviews they’ve gotten. Many of the listings are posted by local game stores, giving you a chance to support small businesses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever product you’re interested in, you can get 10% store credit on it if you check out between Friday and Monday. But you can plan ahead by loading up your cart now, then just wait to check out until this weekend. That will still count, the timing is just based on when you complete your order. To get started, you can head over to <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/3383146/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>TCGplayer</u></a> now.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/trading-card-marketplace-tcgplayer-has-a-special-offer-this-weekend]]></content:encoded>
