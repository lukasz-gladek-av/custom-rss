That is an <strong>incredible </strong>deal for the later 77" screen size. On a normal day, you would be paying that much for the 65" model. This TV and others in LG's C-series lineup have won top spots in several of our buying guides, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-high-end-4k-tv">best 4K TV</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-for-gaming">best TV for gaming</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">best TV for the PlayStation 5</a>.

The Victus is HP's lineup of budget-oriented gaming laptops. This model features a 15" 1080p display, a low-voltage AMD Ryzen 8 8845HS CPU, GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. The RTX 4070 has a maximum TGP rating of 120W, which is actually quite impressive for such an affordable gaming laptop. That means it will perform pretty well relative to other RTX 4070 gaming laptops.</p></div><p id="gaming-laptops"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Gaming Laptops">More Cyber Monday Gaming Laptop Deals</h3></p><div catalogid="028a145e-5dc2-4e3c-a711-702c006350a6" id="211413"><div id="211413" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sony PlayStation 5 Slim Disc Console Fortnite Cobalt Star Console Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony released their entire set of Black Friday PlayStation deals last week and most major retailers have followed suit. The best deal is definitely on the consoles themselves: the PS5 Slim Disc Edition has dropped to $424.99 (originally $500) and the PS5 Slim Digital Edition has dropped to $374.99 (originally $450). I would choose the Disc Edition because it's only $50 more and then I have the option to buy (and later sell or trade) physical disc media. But if you want to save some money and go the Digital Edition route, I would suggest getting the NBA 2K25 bundle, which also includes a game. Although the Fortnite Cobalt Star bundle has a fancy looking box, no actual game is included.</p></div><p id="playstation-5"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="PlayStation 5">More Playstation Cyber Monday Deals</h3></p><div catalogid="56b24fb1-b74e-4b45-8835-20eee9ba9746" id="211427"><div id="211427" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Metaphor: ReFantazio</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://howl.link/fmaa2am0vzacr" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> was released on October 11, so it's nice to see a nice 29% off discount so soon after launch.

Retailers usually release their hottest selling items in batches so that every sale event has at least some inventory reserved. That said, I also expect plenty of new, never before seen deals. Traditionally, Black Friday was known as the "retail holiday," where the best deals were found in-store, and Cyber Monday was known as the "online holiday," where the best deals were online only. Although today the lines have blurred, it is still true that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">many online only retailers still consider Cyber Monday the sale event of the year instead of Black Friday</a>. Expect some amazing sales to come out of online-only sites like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, Lenovo and several online-only deals from traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart.
