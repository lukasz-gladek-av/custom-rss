Our reviewer gave it a 7, saying it was "a fun intergalactic heist adventure with great exploration, but it’s hindered by simple stealth, repetitive combat, and a few too many bugs at launch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft didn't have many details to share beyond reiterating that the title would be available on Nintendo Switch 2 and confirming when, but at least we can update the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/Switch_2_Games_List_-_Release_Date,_Price,_and_Exclusives"><u>Switch 2 Games List.</u></a> With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-order-date-in-the-us-to-assess-impact-of-trumps-tariffs"><u>American and Canadian gamers locked in pre-order limbo</u></a> as Nintendo assesses the impact of the new tariffs introduced by the Republican administration, any news on Nintendo Switch 2 games getting released is a welcome distraction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news was announced during a panel at Star Wars Celebration in Japan today, where Ubisoft also gave fans a look at the second story pack headed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-gets-second-story-update-a-pirates-fortune-in-may">Star Wars: Outlaws, titled A Pirate’s Fortune</a>. The add on will see Kay joining allying with Hondo Ohnaka to take on Stinger Tash, leader of the Rokana Raiders. Star Wars: Outlaws: A Pirate’s Fortune will be released on May 15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial.

It'll be free for season pass holders, otherwise you're going to need $14.99 in credits to join Kay Vess and Nix on a new adventure. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Pirate's Fortune gives players the chance to join forces with Hondo Ohnaka, head of the Ohnaka Gang. Hondo will be a name familiar to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-the-clone-wars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a> fans and readers of the 2017 comic book series Star Wars: Darth Maul, and has even done time as one of the animatronic characters at the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge attraction. This time around he'll be Kay's ally as she takes on Stinger Tash and her gang, the Rokana Raiders, checks out a mysterious tomb and does some smuggling for the Miyuki Trade League. If you haven't quite finished the main storyline quests in Star Wars Outlaws you'll need to get that done to be ready to jump into the new content on May 15. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news was announced during a panel at Star Wars Celebration in Japan today, where Ubisoft also revealed that Star Wars Outlaws would be coming to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on September 4 a few months after the handheld's June 5 launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial.
