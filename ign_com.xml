            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The reveal of new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> details has Nintendo fans furiously speculating about the company's <em>next </em>big 3D platformer — and the return of company mascot Mario.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-bananas-interview-with-the-developers-of-donkey-kong-bananza">revealed by IGN yesterday</a>, Donkey Kong Bananza is being produced by Nintendo veteran Kenta Motokura, and directed by Kazuya Takahashi, a relatively recent addition to the company. Prior to Nintendo, Takahashi worked at Sega and Square Enix on franchises such as Sonic and Final Fantasy. Motokura, meanwhile, directed Super Mario 3D World and Super Mario Odyssey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-finally-confirmed-by-nintendo-sparking-questions-over-when-switch-2s-3d-mario-will-arrive">confirmed to IGN last month</a> that Bananza was being worked on by the team behind Super Mario Odyssey, without detailing exactly who. But now we know who the game's top developers are — and we even know <em>why </em>the game exists, as IGN was told the idea came from Odyssey producer and Nintendo legend Yoshiaki Koizumi.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And here's the part that now has fans wondering. If <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-exists-because-yoshiaki-koizumi-asked-the-mario-odyssey-team-for-a-3d-donkey-kong-game">Donkey Kong Bananza exists because Koizumi asked the Mario Odyssey team to make a 3D Donkey Kong game</a> but Koizumi isn't involved in his usual spot as either director or producer, then... well, what else could Koizumi be making?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of Nintendo's most prolific creators, Koizumi has worked on every major Mario 3D platformer the company has made, acting as assistant director on Super Mario 64, director of Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy, then producer of Super Mario Galaxy 2, Super Mario 3D Land, Super Mario World and Super Mario Odyssey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Koizumi also took on a major role around the launch of Nintendo Switch, acting as general producer for the hardware itself, and appearing as a regular face in Nintendo Direct broadcasts. Now, fans believe Koizumi's absence is a sign he's being saved up for something else: the next big 3D Mario.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/cjwxadk-1752228835804.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nintendo veteran Yoshiaki Koizumi.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The fact that Koizumi (produced Galaxy 2, 3D Land, 3D World, and Odyssey) isn’t working on Bananza is proof enough that there’s a separate 3D Mario in development and that Bananza isn’t supposed to take Mario’s spot," wrote fan BiggieNephew in a <a href="https://x.com/BiggieNephew/status/1943321530487771474" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on X / Twitter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Do you think then Yoshiaki Koizumi is producing the next 3D Mario?" another fan said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"YOSHIAKI KOIZUMI ISN'T THE PRODUCER NOR THE DIRECTOR OF BANANZA!" wrote a third fan, all in caps. "NEW 3D MARIO GAME FOR SWITCH 2 IS SAVED FOR NEXT YEAR, WAHOO! WE BOTH MARIO AND DK FANS CAN COEXIST TOGETHER HAPPILY AT THE START OF THIS NEW ERA OF NINTENDO! (I Hope...)" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the arrival of another 3D Mario game at some point is assured, and none of this speculation appears to be taking away from the fact that Donkey Kong Bananza looks set to be Nintendo's next big and very promising-looking new 3D platformer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the absence of a new 3D Mario around the Switch 2's launch, and an increasingly lengthy wait for a new 3D Mario — since Odyssey's launch back in 2017 — has inevitably sparked speculation, and a hope that, alongside the upcoming delights of Donkey Kong Bananza, Nintendo's next Mario outing is still not too far away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other Donkey Kong Bananza details revealed by IGN this week include the fact <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-was-originally-a-nintendo-switch-1-game">the game started life on Nintendo Switch 1</a>, as well as fresh chatter from Nintendo on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-leads-say-the-reason-pauline-is-13-years-old-specifically-is-for-the-player-to-puzzle-out">how Bananza fits into Donkey Kong canon</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

You'll then head out onto survival missions against familiar Resident Evil foes, with Aniplex promising a "global multiplayer experience." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can watch the full showcase video just below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, it looks like the game's real-time defense battles will be single-player, but Aniplex says you'll also be able to "connect and compete in real time across the globe" with other fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Survival Unit's story begins with your player character shaking off the effects of being an Umbrella Corporation test subject, then recruiting a team of Resident Evil stars to fight back. Over time, you'll upgrade these characters by purchasing items from the Resident Evil Merchant, to take on progressively tougher threats.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/unnamed-1-1752226346639.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Leon may not (yet) be announced for Resident Evil Requiem, but he's included here.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/unnamed-1752226346640.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">How will the game be monetised?

Becca Woolett makes a return from Resident Evil: Resistance, while Resident Evil 2's fallen hero cop Marvin Branagh is also included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just don't expect any of the new story here to be reflected in Requiem when it arrives next year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">An also-ran with a winning attitude.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Umamusume: Pretty Derby, the Japanese mobile game in which you raise anime horse-girls, has brought Japan’s most unsuccessful racehorse a second boom in popularity following its western launch on Steam — with her positive, never-give-up attitude inspiring a whole new set of fans overseas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cygames’ Umamusume: Pretty Derby franchise centers around a cast of anime girls with horse ears and tails. Each one is based on a real racehorse, with the personalities, designs and stats of each character reflecting their IRL counterparts. With the 2021 free-to-play mobile game finally getting its English-language debut this June on Steam, more international fans have been discovering the charms of Umamusume’s characters.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/image007-1752223496532.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Umamusume: Pretty Derby has enjoyed a successful launch in the west via Steam.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pink-haired Haru Urara seems to have struck a particular chord with some players. To say she has a bubbly, positive, can-do attitude would be an understatement. Even though she often loses races, she is good friends with the other horse-girls and often buys them souvenirs. Like Umamusume’s other characters, plucky Haru Urara is based on the real life horse of the same name, who is now 29-years-old and enjoying her retirement at <a href="https://www.matha-farm.com/%E9%A6%AC%E3%81%AE%E7%B4%B9%E4%BB%8B/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Matha Farm</u></a> in Japan’s Chiba Prefecture.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone loves an underdog, or an underhorse in this case. Haru Urara raced from 1998 to 2004, however she didn’t win a single one of her 113 races. Although she made it to second and third place a handful of times, she spent most of her career literally lagging behind (source: <a href="https://www.jbis.jp/horse/0000307965/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>JBIS Search</u></a>). So much so that she became famous for losing, becoming a kind of national symbol of perseverance in the face of adversity.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/gettyimages-154598960-1752223029427.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yutaka Take riding Haru Urara in 2004. Photo by Sports Nippon/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2004, Junichiro Koizumi, the Japanese prime minister at the time, even praised her in his <a href="https://japan.kantei.go.jp/m-magazine/backnumber/koizumi/2004/0325.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official email magazine</u></a>, saying: “I believe that Haru Urara's attitude of not giving up despite being beaten race after race is one that is clearly an inspiration for us all.” In her last years of racing a “Haru Boom” was underway (source: <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/losing-racehorse-charms-japan/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>CBS News</u></a>), with fans travelling across the country to watch her lose races and buying up Haru Urara merch. Even the betting slips with her name on were being used as charms to ward against traffic accidents (the word “<em>ataranai</em>” or “didn’t win” stamped on losing betting slips is a homonym for not being hit, by a car for example). In 2018, Haru Urara became a local celebrity again when she was featured on Chiba police’s traffic safety posters, getting paid 600kg worth of carrots (source: <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20180822-RPWWJE7OAVJCFL6YLXXVVS6TIQ/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Sankei News</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to July 2025, and users posting real life Haru Urara content on X noticed a sudden uptick of likes and follows, likely the Umamusume effect in action. X user animal_love_kaz, a self-confessed fan of retired racehorses who frequently posts photos and updates noted that their Haru Urara birthday post suddenly got thousands more likes overnight, with their overseas account gaining 400 new followers. In a <a href="https://x.com/animal_love_kaz/status/1940610702202511743" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>July 3 post, below,</u></a> featuring a photo of the horse with a flower on her head that has since racked up 2.6 million views, animal_love_kaz wrote: "I don’t know if this will reach my overseas bros and sisters but Haru Urara is very well, in fact, she’s probably healthier and more energetic than me!"</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">なぜかウララさんの今年の誕生日の時のティアラのが昨日からまた更に1万くらいイイネが増えてて通知止まらんし海外アカで昨日から400人くらいフォロワー増えてるじゃん<br>海外ニキネキ達に伝わるかわからないけど、ハルウララさんはとても元気で過ごしてるし、むしろ私より健康で元気なくらいだよ😆👍 <a href="https://t.co/E9MKbUaPRj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/E9MKbUaPRj</a></p>— もつご (@animal_love_kaz) <a href="https://twitter.com/animal_love_kaz/status/1940610702202511743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Umamusume’s Haru Urara has even been co-opted into the “Why don’t you ever give up?” “Because she never did!” meme, which is now floating around a social media comment thread near you (here it is on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tamanpermainan/comments/1lpuun7/the_horse_that_inspires_people_to_never_give_up/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit</u></a>). It seems that Haru Urara has become a symbol of not giving up in the face of adversity for a whole new group of fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In-game Haru Urara naturally doesn’t have the best stats compared to other characters. However players can take on the challenge of trying to make her a winner in the game, or at the very least, just enjoy her infectious positive attitude in the Story Mode cutscenes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Haru Urara is also a reminder that if your career isn't working out right now, you may find success in another field (pun intended) later on. Although Haru Urara was not successful as a racehorse, she is now gaining popularity on social media, and living out her retirement years with her friend Pepper the goat. Matha Farms even has <a href="https://suzuri.jp/Matha-Farm/products" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official merch</u></a> featuring her, from T-shirts to cushion covers and phone straps. Some fans visit her, but with the surge in popularity of these real life racehorses, Umamusume developer Cygames recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/umamusume-pretty-derby-dev-reminds-fans-to-follow-the-rules-when-visiting-the-real-life-japanese-racehorses-behind-their-favorite-anime-horse-girls"><u>shared guidelines on how to respectfully meet your horsey idols in real life</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mobile game Umamusume: Pretty Derby is available now in English via Steam, Google Play, and the Apple App store.
