Saying goodbye to talented colleagues and friends is painful. These individuals have contributed meaningfully to our studios, our games, and our culture. I want to thank them for the contributions they have made that shaped our journey as a team and as a company.</blockquote><blockquote>Today is a day to support one another. Please know we are working closely with impacted employees to ensure they are treated with respect and have our full support during these difficult times. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your manager or HR support team.</blockquote><blockquote>I also want to share today that Matt Firor has decided to step down from his role as the head of ZeniMax Online Studios, effective July 14. I want to offer heartfelt thanks to Matt for his incredible leadership of ZOS over the last 18 years. As a driving force behind the success of The Elder Scrolls Online, Matt has grown the game into one of the most enduring and beloved MMOs in the industry.</blockquote><blockquote>I’m pleased to announce that Joseph (“Jo”) Burba will be taking over for Matt Firor as the new Studio Director for ZOS. With over 20 years in the industry, his extensive experience in live service multiplayer titles, and a strong background in various roles across ZOS the past thirteen years, Jo is well-prepared to lead the team into its next chapter.</blockquote><blockquote>Matt, Jo, and I will work together to finalize our transition plan – more to come soon. In the meantime, please join me in wishing Matt all the best and congratulating Jo on his new role.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you to all of you for your dedication to Bethesda/ZeniMax, our community, and to each other. </blockquote><blockquote>Jill</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The reference to Matt’s note here is the prior memo Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios, sent to Microsoft gaming staff today confirming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox">the cancelation of Rare's Everwild</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">the Perfect Dark reboot</a>, as well as the closure of Xbox studio The Initiative.

As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment.</blockquote><blockquote>Our overall portfolio strategy is unchanged: build games that excite our players, continue to grow our biggest franchises, and create new stories, worlds, and characters. We have more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026.</blockquote><blockquote>For those directly affected, we are working closely with HR and studio leadership to provide support, including severance, career transition assistance, and where possible, opportunities to explore roles on other teams.</blockquote><blockquote>To everyone across our studios: thank you. Your creativity and resilience continue to define who we are. I believe in the strength of our teams and the direction we're taking on the path ahead.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">- Matt</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has made a huge number of cuts to its gaming business since acquiring Activision Blizzard for $69 billion. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">It laid off 1,900 staff in January 2024</a>, then made further cuts just a few months later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">when it closed Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks</a>.

Perfect Dark first debuted on the N64 back in 2000, developed by Rare, which has survived today's cull.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a memo to staff sent today and reviewed by IGN, Xbox boss Phil Spencer failed to confirm specifics, telling staff “any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The following message from Phil Spencer was shared to all gaming staff today:</p><blockquote>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.</blockquote><blockquote>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</blockquote><blockquote>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental — it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.</blockquote><blockquote>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey.</blockquote><blockquote>Phil</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has made a huge number of cuts to its gaming business since acquiring Activision Blizzard for $69 billion. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">It laid off 1,900 staff in January 2024</a>, then made further cuts just a few months later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">when it closed Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks</a>.

At this price, it’s a sharp buy for any AC fan.</p></div><p id="m3gan-20-limited-edition-steelboo"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="M3GAN 2.0 - Limited Edition Steelboo">M3GAN 2.0 - Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital)</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223899"><div id="223899" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>M3GAN 2.0 - Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">M3GAN 2.0 dials up the chaos and trades in some of the original’s horror flair for a louder sci-fi action vibe. The Limited Edition Steelbook packs in 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and Digital formats for $37.99, with a pre-order guarantee that locks in the best price. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/m3gan-2-review-allison-williams-jemaine-clement">While we noted the sequel stumbles trying to balance satire and spectacle</a>, M3GAN still steals the spotlight with her savage wit and unpredictable presence. It may not reinvent the killer robot genre, but if you’re in for stylish carnage and sharp-edged commentary, this edition delivers plenty of polished personality for the price.</p></div><p id="wowbox-32-pcs-clear-plastic-drawer"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" WOWBOX 32 PCS Clear Plastic Drawer "> WOWBOX 32 PCS Clear Plastic Drawer Organizer Set</h2></p><div catalogid="1bc59909-398e-495b-92aa-9cfd51a5260c" id="223900"><div id="223900" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> WOWBOX 32 PCS Clear Plastic Drawer Organizer Set</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For $15.99, this 32-piece WOWBOX drawer organizer set is an easy win for cutting clutter across any room.

For example, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7YM4?object_uuid=846ed0e8-2a82-47cd-bbd1-7a9842c18700&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prismatic Evolutions Super-Premium Collection</a> was a massive 56% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xEG5?object_uuid=846ed0e8-2a82-47cd-bbd1-7a9842c18700&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">market value</a>, but TCG Player is coming in cheaper now at $195. On the other end of the scale, TCG Player has <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnm1k?object_uuid=846ed0e8-2a82-47cd-bbd1-7a9842c18700&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cynthia’s Garchomp ex Premium Collection</a> at a massive 48% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpXZv?object_uuid=846ed0e8-2a82-47cd-bbd1-7a9842c18700&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon's current price</a>, which is very close to MSRP.

</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">This Weeks Pokémon Card Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been keeping a close eye on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-june-23">Pokémon TCG market this month</a>, and we’re seeing two very different stories unfold. On one side, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a> cards are going through a steep correction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Crown Zenith</a> cards are showing early signs of what could be a long-term value surge. The bottom line? If you're a collector or investor, <strong>now is the time to buy into both.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m picking up what I can from both sets. The current dip in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-booster-bundle-shining-fates-amazon-restock-latest">Sparks</a> is a glimmer of hope for long-suffering 2024-2025 collectors. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-card-packs">Crown Zenith</a> is a train I want to be on before it leaves the station.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Classic</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sam's Club Pokémon TCG Classic deal is back, and it's massively undercutting other big box retailers and the secondary market. Just for comparrison, the top four cards from this set, Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur and Mewtwo, are worth the same price as this discounted offer. This deal is well worth it and should be snapped up as soon as possible.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Mega Evolution Pokémon Cards Are Climbing</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"> I can't believe the X Y era of Pokémon cards came out 12 years ago, but it was an amazing era for the TCG introducing the Mega Evolution mechanic. Mega's will be returning later this year with the start of the Mega Evolutions era and the end of Scarlet and Violet, so snapping up these top Mega cards before prices go even higher is a wise move. We know how it'll play out, no one will be able to grab the new sets at launch, then the nostalgia will kick in and these cards will skyrocket.  Just the Charizards and Rayquazzas alone are worth a look.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Magic: The Gathering Price Comparison</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">MTG doesn't seem to be struggling to keep up with demand despite it being one of the biggest trading card games on earth, but that doesn't stop big box retailers getting cheeky when they notice a peak in demand. Like with Pokémon TCG, i've gone through the majority of MTG stock on Amazon and compared their pricing to market values on TCG Player. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1vxV?object_uuid=846ed0e8-2a82-47cd-bbd1-7a9842c18700&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Theros Beyond Death booster</a> made me spit out my tea.

Go figure.
