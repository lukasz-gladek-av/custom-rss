The content available will be in various stages of production, including items in alpha state, which may result in less polished and/or unstable builds. This allows DICE to balance and make adjustments much faster as it "shapes the future of the game with the community to shape the future of the game."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/bf-labs-resumes-update-1756460090903.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Battlefield Portal user interface. Image credit: EA.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This next collection of play sessions will focus primarily on hosting, where the team will "concentrate on the ease of setting up player-owned servers with predefined shortcodes, altering descriptions, selecting tags, and joining those experiences." And as part of this, we've been given our first look at the Battlefield Portal user interface.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Some of the most frequent questions from the community have been about Server Browser availability and functionality," DICE explained in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battlefield-labs-testing" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>community</u></a> blog. "In an upcoming Battlefield Labs play session, we will enable an early implementation of this Portal functionality within the Community tab. At this stage, our main goal is to observe how it works in practice, with initial feedback focusing on accessibility and UI clarity."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players will be able to use the experience library to find a verified Conquest experience using a shortcode, after which players can then choose from a pre-filtered list of active servers, or host their own, where they'll be able to alter descriptions, rotations, tags, and so on. Of course, this should still be treated as a work-in-progress for now, and DICE would like feedback from Battlefield Labs participants as they play.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The next batch of closed tests will also usher in new maps, Operation Firestorm and Mirak Valley, which are designed for combined arms combat and vehicles, including quad bikes, tanks, and aircraft. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're having a great time with what we've played so far, writing in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer"><u>Battlefield 6 review-in-progress</u></a>: "Right now, even in beta form, Battlefield 6 might be the most fun shooter I’ve played this year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't forget that from now until October 7 — Battlefield 6's launch day — EA has a "wave of content" planned for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-2042"><u>Battlefield 2042</u></a>, including a free new pass "celebrating the legacy of Battlefield," new hardware, and a reimagining of the fan favorite Iwo Jima map.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It is the driving force behind many of your favorite video games released in the last few years, but it largely flies under the radar. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> are just a few of the many games that were and continue to be supported by Virtuos, one of the largest independent video game companies in the world with over 20 studios globally employing about 4,000 staff. Still, the average gamer probably doesn’t know Virtuos exists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s starting to change though, with Virtuos’ profile rising with each new release. Oblivion Remastered is perhaps Virtuos’ biggest project yet, and its heavy involvement with its development was made a key part of the game’s announcement by Bethesda. Meanwhile, CD Projekt livestreams feature members of the Virtuos development team. Looking ahead, Ken Levine’s BioShock follow-up, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/judas">Judas</a>, and Riot’s League of Legends fighting game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/2xko">2XKO</a>, will both come out with Virtuos’ help.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it has not all been plain sailing. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/despite-laying-off-270-staff-development-studio-virtuos-remains-fully-committed-to-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-cyberpunk-2077-and-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Virtuos laid off approximately 7% of its global workforce</a>, or around 270 staff. In a statement, Virtuos said it was "evolving to meet the changing needs" of its partners and the wider video games industry. Most of the layoffs affected Virtuos’ Asian workforce.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a wide-ranging interview with IGN at gamescom 2025, Virtuos CEO Gilles Langourieux discussed the company’s history, its recent projects, and what it’s hoping to achieve in the future. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which has gone a long way to putting Virtuos on the map this year, was a big part of our chat.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/28/virtuos-gilles-langourieux-landscape-1756412895462.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Virtuos CEO Gilles Langourieux.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Langourieux said Virtuos’ expertise when it came to remasters (Batman, Final Fantasy, Dark Souls Remastered) meant it was a natural part of the conversation around Oblivion’s return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We managed to convince Todd Howard and his team that we could do it,” Langourieux began. “He had known us for a while. And then how does it work? You prove what you're capable of during a pilot phase. You deliver a convincing vertical slice or pilot. You align with the team at Bethesda on what they believe is the level of quality or detail required to meet their audience goal, and you continue all the way to final ship.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtuos developed Oblivion Remastered using Unreal Engine 5. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology. The changes went down well with fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake"><u>some of whom believe Oblivion Remastered would be more accurately described as a remake</u></a>. Bethesda, however, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-comments-on-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-changes-we-never-wanted-to-remake-it"><u>has explained why it went down the remaster route</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Langourieux said Virtuos knew it had to use a new engine for Oblivion Remastered to bring the classic RPG up to date in terms of graphics and performance, but also retain the original engine so veteran fans would recognize Oblivion’s gameplay. As Todd Howard himself described it, Bethesda was keen for the Oblivion remaster to have some of that “old charm.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We realized that one of the solutions would have to be to combine the original engine with a new engine. Virtuos happens to have a long experience working with Unreal,” Langourieux said. “We've done a number of projects like this where we combine — it's called engine pairing — we pair two engines to work together so that the gameplay comes from the original engine, but the rendering and the new modern bells and whistles come from the new engine. And our experience doing that, our experience with Unreal, was one of the things we had to bring to the table.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, hundreds of artists were mobilized to work on Oblivion Remastered to “nail” the Oblivion art style while also modernizing it. Virtuos had its studio in Paris lead the project, making technical, design, and artistic choices about the game, with the help of other Virtuos studios. At Bethesda, a small team under the direct supervision of Todd Howard monitored Virtuos’ work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At peak, around 400 people at Virtuos worked on Oblivion Remastered. This was a true AAA development effort spread out across a number of years. The end result was a successful release, a video game played by over 9 million people at this point, and a (largely) impressed fanbase. Virtuos itself was made a part of Bethesda’s official Oblivion Remastered announcement video, which Langourieux appreciated.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Sometimes when you tackle these kinds of projects, you worry about talking about a new developer because you're worried that new developer name might not resonate so well with the audience,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They put their money where their mouth is by supporting us very transparently and openly, and that has given us more visibility than other projects have. So credit to them for that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077, Oblivion Remastered, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater… what’s next? With all sorts of rumors swirling around about more Bethesda remasters, could Virtuos be helping out with, say, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-success-ex-bethesda-dev-expects-a-fallout-3-remaster-would-significantly-improve-the-not-good-gun-combat">a Fallout remaster of some description?</a> Of course, Langourieux won’t name names, but did talk generally about what Virtuos has up its sleeve, and teased “similar” titles to Oblivion Remastered coming from the company in the years ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I won't be able to share specifics,” he began, “but what I can say is that you've seen what we're capable of for a big, impactful remaster like Oblivion. You can expect more similar titles to come out of Virtuos in the coming years. And you can also expect to see us involved in expanding the life of large-life titles. Those would be two directions that I'm super excited about.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But will Virtuos break out of its support act status and make an original IP of its own? Langourieux seems happy with where his company is at right now, insisting “not everyone aspires to be the rockstar.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have a lot of ambition,” Langourieux said. “We've built one of the largest, most stable game developers in the business, and we intend to continue doing that. We've done it by being very clear about what we're good at and how we can serve our clients in the industry. And there's a lot of ambition with that. Not everything is about being the rockstar. Not everyone aspires to be the rockstar. We're playing a different role."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly a year on from the launch of MachineGames' brilliant <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, the studio is back with an additional chapter, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants">The Order of the Giants</a>, which arrives on September 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who enjoyed the base game's blend of puzzle-solving and fisticuffs, this fresh DLC adds more of what you love — and takes a novel approach to tuning its difficulty, based on your experience with the Great Circle so far. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN last week at Gamescom, creative director Axel Torvenius and lead game designer Zeke Virant explained how The Order of the Giants will smartly adapt its combat to suit both new and veteran players, due to the DLC's addition within the base game's narrative, branching off of its Rome location. And while the pair remained tight-lipped on word of an Indiana Jones sequel, discussion was still had about MachineGames' intention for the overall narrative of the game — and how it's sometimes best to leave players keen for more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The conventional way of doing DLC is to add something that stands after, or a miniature game on the side," Torvenius begins, "but we didn't really feel that that was the best for our game." He pauses, smiles. "Though it would've been the easiest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can tell you we had a lot of struggles or challenges with the technical side of things, making sure that people's existing save states [work]. The systems we had in place did not fully support us just splicing in a lot of new content in the middle of the game. So there was a lot of hard work from engineers and programmers and also on the design side. It was not an easy thing to do, but we felt it was the best to do."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who are yet to play Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, the idea is that Order of the Giants simply adds onto the game's already generous Rome section, with additional areas outside and underneath the Vatican to explore. And for players who have finished the game already, who will likely be familiar with dipping back into previous areas to hunt down remaining side-missions and collectibles via their journal, the DLC simply acts as a huge new side-quest to pursue. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The integration makes the experience the most seamless," Torvenius continues, "and makes it feel like it's really expanding on the existing content. There was a balance, because obviously the DLC is its own completely standalone adventure. So there are hooks and the red threads between the main storyline and the DLC, but the DLC story does not impact the main story, even if the DLC story will give you a deeper understanding of some elements. So it was absolutely not the easiest [way to do DLC], and maybe not the smartest, but the best."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: The Order of Giants DLC Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously, though, players still finding their feet in the Vatican's sunny courtyards will have a different experience approaching Order of the Giants' content than those who have played another 40 hours, seen Indy's journey to the end and buffed up their archeologist with all sorts of upgrades and bonuses. And it's because of this, Virant says, that MachineGames was forced to get even smarter under the game's hood.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Players who are at the end of the game don't need to worry about the difficulty [being too easy] as actually we have a new system in place where players are dynamically scaled based on how far they progressed," Virant explains. "We know a lot of players are coming back from the endgame and would like to have a continuation of that difficulty, especially if they have health upgrades and a lot of abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We tried a few different things, but the one that was simplest and actually just what felt right was that if you've progressed to the Vatican but you haven't gotten to Giza yet, we keep it on a first tier of difficulty. If you've gotten to Giza, then we adjust it up to a second tier. And then once you've gotten to Sukhothai, we adjust to a third tier. From there we [can tune] the different amount of combos enemies can use, different amounts of health and also how many will gang up on you at the same time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a smart system, though one which need not come into play at all during the DLC's first hour, as Indy kicks off his new adventure with some impressive-looking new adventuring and puzzle sections, set just outside the bounds of the base game's existing area. It's here that Indy meets Father Ricci, a priest obsessed with the legend of a secret chamber that houses a giant helmet - something that immediately sparks our hero's interest. (Brilliantly, Father Ricci also has a pet parrot, Pio, who rather steals the show. Torvenius confirmed that while the parrot speaks, this is not another turn from the talented Troy Baker, and is instead another voice actress who provides the parrots' voice and much of its chirping sounds.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The DLC's focus on the main game's race of giants, otherwise known as the Nephilim Order, will likely pique the intrigue of fans who enjoyed piecing together their story during the Great Circle's campaign. Sadly, the late Tony Todd, who played Locus, was not able to contribute to the DLC — though Torvenius said his presence "would have been amazing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To some extent this was never really about telling the background story of Locus as a character," he said. "Even though for me personally, I would've loved to play a game that was where you just play as Locus for 15 hours on all of his grand adventures. That would've been interesting. But this was more about deepening the story of the tribe of the giants and the Nephilim Order. And obviously Locus is part of that since he's part of the race, but it's more about the origins and the mystery of it and how it connects with the Vatican and the streets of Rome."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked whether players will learn everything there is to know about the giants before the end of the DLC, or whether MachineGames was purposefully keeping some elements of their story secret, Torvenius remained coy. "Yes and no," he replied. "I would say I think absolutely this will help for people that have played through the main game, and when they have played the DLC in addition to that, they will get a deeper understanding of the mystery around the Nephilim Order. But there are things that maybe are to some extent left unanswered, though the majority of it I think starts to paint a pretty good picture."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/28/giants-dlc-cavern-4k-1756390200862.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Was this secrecy a desire to hold some story elements back for use in the future, I wondered, or simply a decision not to explain too much — the Midichlorians effect — of something that could otherwise remain a cool mystery? "In my mind, both as a consumer myself but also as a creator, I enjoy when maybe sometimes everything isn't explored," Torvenius responded. "Sometimes there will be still like a fog of war on the map that is best left unexplored.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have internally fleshed it out completely," he continued, discussing the lore of the giants. "I could write a blurb that explains how everything is connected, but would that be fun?" <em>Yes</em>, I say, to which Torvenius laughs. "We are always working towards giving players the sensation they have figured it out and it should make sense when it's all connected. But for me it's always important to make sure you slowly get a bigger picture without saying too much."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Torvenius and Virant, Order of the Giants has been a challenging but enjoyable victory lap for one of 2024's most widely-praised games. Development on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle began amid the height of Covid lockdowns, with the studio forced to collaborate via Microsoft Teams. For the DLC, however, its developers have been together throughout, able to build on what has come before, in the knowledge they're working on something that is already beloved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The overall quality of the DLC is absolutely on par and in some instances higher than main game," Torvenius concludes. "For people that love the Great Circle and the world of Indiana Jones that MachineGames built, this is more of that. It's really for them. And if you haven't played the base game, we are really hoping that this is a great opportunity for people wanting to play. It's been a great adventure doing it, a lot of hard work, but it's been fun to see. Sometimes you work on a game for many years and towards the end there can almost be a bit of fatigue, or you're a bit exhausted. But when production really geared up on the DLC, people were still energized. I think that passion for Indiana Jones shines through, and we are extremely proud of it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
