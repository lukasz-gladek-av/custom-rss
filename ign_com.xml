We’ve teamed up with the experts at Maxroll to bring you a beginner’s guide, builds to crush the game’s hardest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/wuchang-fallen-feathers/Boss_Guides">bosses</a>, additional resources and mechanical overviews, and much more. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Beginner's Guide</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Get started with Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/wuchang-fallen-feathers/guides/wuchang-fallen-feathers-beginners-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Beginner's Guide</u></a>. Combat in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is different from a lot of other Soulslikes, as your main resource Skyborn Might revolves around getting “perfect dodges” called Shimmers (think Sekiro but with hitting B instead of LB). You can then spend Skyborn Might to empower your weapon skills, or instantly execute a charged heavy attack. This is particularly useful because you can use charged heavy attacks to stagger foes, opening them up to a powerful Obliterate attack. Maxroll’s Beginner’s Guide also covers topics like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/wuchang-fallen-feathers/How_to_Level_Up">leveling up</a> using the Impetus Repository system, how the game’s unique <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/wuchang-fallen-feathers/Madness_(Inner_Demon)_Explained">Madness system</a> works, and the various character progression systems including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/wuchang-fallen-feathers/How_Temperance_Works">Temperance</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/wuchang-fallen-feathers/How_to_Unlock_and_Use_Benedictions">Benedictions</a>, <a href="https://maxroll.gg/wuchang-fallen-feathers/guides/wuchang-discipline-guide-best-disciplines" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disciplines</a> and more.

The Longsword is a balanced weapon that acts as a middle ground. Spears have great reach and excellent Disciplines, but have a weaker charged heavy attack animation. One-Handed Swords have long animations and low damage but provide Spell Damage, enabling a dedicated caster archetype. The Dual Blades reward all out aggression as you clash through enemy attacks and heal yourself. Axes hit hard, staggering foes and stopping them in their tracks, but they also tend to be slower and have higher stamina costs. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://maxroll.gg/wuchang-fallen-feathers/builds/dual-blades-blademaster-build-in-wuchang-fallen-feathers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Dual Blades Blademaster</u></a></li><li><a href="https://maxroll.gg/wuchang-fallen-feathers/builds/one-handed-swords-spell-build-in-wuchang-fallen-feathers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Spellcaster Build</u></a></li><li><a href="https://maxroll.gg/wuchang-fallen-feathers/builds/axe-rampage-build-in-wuchang-fallen-feathers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Axe Rampage Build</u></a></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Database</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/database-wffimg1-1024x767-1753926837961.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Use Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/wuchang-fallen-feathers/database" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers database</u></a> to learn more about all of the items in the game.
