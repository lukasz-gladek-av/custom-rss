            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The opening area of the campaign for Styx: Blades of Greed shows promise and the potential for creative stealth gameplay as a tiny but mighty creature in spaces designed for much larger beings. Extinguishing torches to create safe passages, cutting chandelier chains to crush groups of guards, and popping out of goblin-sized tunnels to assassinate enemies from behind is just kind of Styx’s thing. And now, the third entry in the series has sharpened its blades considerably. If you already liked Styx: Master of Shadows, Styx: Shards of Darkness, or any of the series’ obvious inspirations – such as Thief, Dishonored, Assassin’s Creed, et cetera – you’re in for a treat when Styx: Blades of Greed launches on February 19 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get into the nitty-gritty of goblin life, it’s worth noting that the preview session ran through a cloud streaming service, which, unfortunately, experienced considerable latency issues that made the caliber of precision platforming necessary to progress through Styx: Blades of Greed feel more like piloting a drone on another continent than stepping into the boots of a little green fellow. Split-second timing defines Styx's gameplay loop, making input delay a serious obstacle when it appears. Fortunately, after massively downgrading bitrate settings to get this zeppelin flying, the early areas uncovered a beautiful and compelling high-fantasy world with plenty of nooks and crannies to explore.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Styx: Blades of Greed Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On first boot, there’s an initial accessibility menu with thoughtful implementation, which is always nice to see. Options for deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia colorblindness modes appear alongside adjustable color vision deficiency severity, color spectrum shifting, and controller vibration settings. It takes less than a second to skip through, but matters enormously to players who need it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You’ll travel between even larger locations on a sweet zeppelin in classic Warhammer or World of Warcraft fashion.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After a decently paced and informative opening cutscene, a subsequent tutorial layers in movement mechanics gradually. Running, jumping, double-jumping, and power sliding are all properly introduced and explained as the playable zone starts opening up, which is great because the tutorial itself doesn’t overstay its welcome. The B button executes a slide that allows players to slip under obstacles or cover ground quickly, while pressing RB after a jump triggers a cool little dash that propels Styx upward along walls. The preview build also included advanced saves that showcased grappling hook and glider mechanics in the Turquoise Dawn environment, which are available later on in the campaign. That said, our session focused primarily on the opening hours centered around The Wall, a sprawling human settlement built on the side of a mountain.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Styx: Blades of Greed commits earnestly to its high-fantasy roots, and its environments carry substantial detail to help players establish a sense of place in its immersive world. For instance, its opening zone features ornate dwarven architecture covered in ramshackle human structures and detritus, illuminated by atmospheric lighting that casts long shadows across vast industrial spaces. You’ll also travel between even larger locations on a sweet zeppelin in classic Warhammer or World of Warcraft fashion. A deep level of consideration went into the way this world functions, and playing as a goblin within it provides a distinct perspective that makes Styx both unique and interesting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll find zeppelin crewmates like the dark elf Djarak and human pilot Helledrin to be well-written, which adds dimensionality. Meanwhile, the world is sprinkled with fun side-interactions throughout. Random guards can be overheard making offhand comments about eating goblins and turning them into pies, which would be darkly humorous if they weren't actively trying to murder our boy Styx. Besides some minor NPCs that sound like they're reading lines off scripts, using jarring modern American accents that clash with this vibrant fantasy setting, Styx: Blades of Greed’s voice acting broadly delivers solid performances, particularly during the cutscenes that act as connective tissue between the first few playable areas.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dead Zeppelin</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Styx: Blades of Greed is one of those games where trial and error are key gameplay elements, and you’ll probably die a lot while figuring out the best strategy to get through each challenge. Falling too far will kill you instantly. Likewise, walking into environmental traps like energy-spewing fissures, laser grids, and explosive vents will end your runs immediately. If you find yourself caught in direct combat, enemies kill in two or three hits. Death physics can, at times, create unintentionally comedic moments that add to the fun. For instance, when Styx flops around like a ragdoll after a mistimed jump sends him plummeting off a ledge.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s all perfectly fine because autosaves are extremely frequent, and death here is almost overly forgiving. Respawns rarely throw players back more than a minute or two, meaning death is more of a teaching tool than a setback. Each failure reveals something about enemy patrol patterns, environmental hazard placement, or ability limitations. In this way, Styx encourages methodical approaches and keeps everything good and fun, keeping its pacing steady even during some of its harder encounters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What became clear after the first hour is that Styx: Blades of Greed rewards patience and observation in addition to twitch reflexes. There’s a solid selection of abilities to unlock as well, including Invisibility, which is activated by holding RT and pressing A and can prove invaluable when slipping past large groups of enemies. The climbing mechanics do sometimes feel janky, which could be a side effect of those aforementioned cloud streaming service issues – but animations also look unnatural, moving Styx up surfaces faster than what seems physically plausible.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the stealth systems show a clearer mix of promise and limitations. On a positive note, light and shadow both matter significantly. Enemies spot Styx more easily in illuminated areas, while darkness provides cover. Players can extinguish torches with the Y button, creating safe passages through otherwise dangerous zones. Silent kills require careful positioning – like approaching from behind or above – but when executed properly, stealth is mechanically rewarding. Styx: Blades of Greed’s satisfying death animations convey a brutal elegance to grabbing an enemy, bringing them to their knees, and ending them with a quick throat stab, goblin-style.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Styx: Blades of Greed’s satisfying death animations convey a brutal elegance to grabbing an enemy, bringing them to their knees, and ending them with a quick throat stab, goblin-style.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even so, the enemy AI typically often came up short in intelligence in the preview build. Guards sometimes get stuck on geometry or fail to react logically to obvious threats. In one notable instance, an enemy watched Styx kill his companion, then promptly turned around and stood facing a door, waiting to receive a knife in his gullet. This inconsistency in tone and mechanical depth is disappointing at times, undermining the tension Styx works so hard to establish with its thick atmosphere, slick stealth action, and excellent worldbuilding. There are times when enemy guards feel genuinely threatening, using ranged weapons with alarming accuracy even when Styx hides in supposedly safe spots like rooftops, or easily scrounging him out of simpler hiding places like cupboards and barrels. And then there are times they seem to forget they’re guards altogether, making it way easier to simply walk to the next zone like Boromir would walk into Mordor if he were a real Son of Gondor.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Stick 'em Wiv Knives</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Direct combat in Styx: Blades of Greed feels deliberately awkward, which makes thematic sense: Styx is a small goblin, not a warrior. But this creates frustrating moments when stealth fails. To fight, you must manually draw your dagger by pressing into the right stick, which feels incredibly clunky, creating vulnerable moments during frantic situations. Enemies can much more easily block your attacks, interrupt strikes, and deal significant damage, slaying you in just a few hits; by the time combat starts, you’re basically already dead unless you can run elsewhere and hide.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/30/ss-6c16015c621d70e39091ba3af62e4bdffe522532-1920x1080-1767125038889.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a dodge mechanic here, and enemies do telegraph attacks with a blue flash before striking – but timing feels inconsistent, especially when fighting multiple opponents in confined spaces. The camera compounds these issues by obscuring key details in tight quarters, frequently clipping through geometry while players attempt to track Styx and the enemies he’s trying to fight off. This game clearly wants its problems solved through stealth, not brute force. This would be fine if some of the challenges didn’t end up feeling more punitive than strategic, with far too many enemies to outsmart and not enough breathing room to outmaneuver them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s good, then, that each area typically includes at least one scripted environmental interaction that allows real creativity if you manage to weave it into your strategy. In one tavern, you can cut chandelier chains to crush the group of enemies waiting below, but you’ll need to have already snuck past or incapacitated a whole other group of foes to use this opportunity efficiently. Most of the time, there are opportunities to lure guards into explosive barrels or turn off lights to make an easier path for yourself. These moments highlight what Styx does well: rewarding clever observation and planning over reflexes and combat skill.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/30/ss-54011d695a81a99ffe91820c5d24cdd49c2118e2-1920x1080-1767125053526.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">About an hour into the session, Styx’s seemingly robust progression systems started becoming available, giving the moment-to-moment gameplay a sense of depth that rewarded exploration beyond surviving to the next story beat. There’s a decent system for item crafting in the field. This feels similar to A Plague Tale in that you’ll collect raw materials in the environment that enable the instant creation of distractions and limited-use weapons. Craftable glass bottles break on impact and distract nearby enemies. Whistles lure guards toward specific locations. Acid traps eliminate both enemies and their bodies, removing evidence quickly and efficiently – a real boon if you can’t find enough time to hide a body in a nearby container before a passing guard catches up to you. Bolts provide ranged silent kills, though the physics feel janky and slow since bolts fly in straight lines and enemies slump over in basic ragdoll animations that lack the cinematic flair the rest of the game strives for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Styx can equip up to four of these items at once in his quick slots, creating opportunities to switch up loadouts depending upon the situation. The crafting system requires gathering uncommon materials such as iron ore and cloth scraps scattered throughout each level.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/30/ss-6526cba475bab4032dbe418e887579151b439856-1920x1080-1767125068422.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of progression, it’s cool to see experience points accumulate from exploration and successful encounters, eventually unlocking skills in two categories: Amber skills, which lean defensive, and Quartz skills, which feel more aggressive. During the preview session, there were eight unlockable skills visible in the character menu. We only got a chance to try Invisibility and Clone Decoy, but the in-game menu shows some intriguing options that open up further into the story. A few that stood out included Time Shift for super-speed movement, Mind Control for possessing enemies, and Flux Blast for sending out waves of energy and knocking back enemies. The Clone Decoy move is particularly versatile; you throw it down at a location of your choosing, and it makes noise to distract enemies. It seems like with upgrades, multiple clones can remain active simultaneously, making it worthwhile to pump extra points into it if that’s your thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Granted, this framework suggests meaningful customization over the course of Styx’s estimated 20-hour campaign. Being able to specialize Styx's abilities based on preferred playstyle – whether that be pure stealth, aggressive elimination of key targets, or a hybrid approach – could add some decent replay value if the system is ultimately as robust as it feels during these early hours.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/30/ss-ff1ae2f80f75e2d0d202364aa4bd771e7e82f925-1920x1080-1767125082647.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We spent roughly two hours with Styx: Blades of Greed, and it already looks like a potentially great high-fantasy stealth action game that understands what made the first two entries in its franchise work while expanding upon their scope. The Wall is a breathtaking zone, demonstrating Styx’s impressive environmental storytelling. Standing upon rooftop vantage points and looking outward, you can see the rolling mass of buildings clinging to the mountainside connected by precarious bridges, fires dotting the darkness below, creating a sense of lived-in verticality that excites us for the rest of the campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even in its current state, though, significant questions remain. Particularly around whether the enemy AI improves beyond its early inconsistencies, whether the grappling hook and glider feel good in later zones, or whether the narrative delivers on its setup as Styx leads a zeppelin crew in pursuit of valuable Quartz and away from the pursuing Inquisition that’s set out to hunt him down. The technical rough edges and combat frustrations can't be ignored, but they also don’t obscure the feat that Blades of Greed attempts and largely seems to nail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Simply put, we’re excited for the rest of it. This is already shaping up to be a memorable third entry to cap off the Styx trilogy, and hopefully it will become the next great methodical stealth game in the vein of classic Thief and Dishonored.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/styx-blades-of-greed-aims-to-carry-the-torch-for-stealth-games]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1397446</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> fan has discovered hidden name explanations for the game's enemies and other characters buried within the game's files, which give an intriguing look at some of their origins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The descriptions — some of which even include links out to Wikipedia — were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1q16bft/just_found_out_very_interesting_things_in_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=post_embed&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discovered</a> by reddit user Responsible-Race-575 and appear to have been intended for development staff translating the game's text into other languages. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Clair Obscur is developed by French studio Sandfall Interactive and is heavily influenced by French language and culture, and the explanations here look to be an attempt to ensure as much of the game's original references make it through into other languages. So, how much did you spot?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the name references are straightforward. A note for the Nevron enemy Potier explains that its name simply means "potter", because "it's an enemy that uses pots." Fair enough. The trumpet-wielding Troubadour, meanwhile, uses the same name as that of a French minstrel or composer. Makes sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barbasucette is a combination of the French words for beard ("barbe") and lolipop ("sucette"). Licornapieds is the smushing together of unicorn ("licorn") and 'with feet' ("à pieds"). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you hadn't guessed already, the annoying Petank enemy — a fast-moving ball on legs that likes to run away — is a reference to the French boules game Pétanque. Finally, it's confirmed that Gestral fighter Ono Puncho is indeed a reference to anime hero One-Punch Man (and Sandfall even provides a Wikipedia link to details of the anime for further explanation).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite note is the one for a gestral named Limonsol, whose name is simply explained as an "inside joke." No further detail is provided, other than a request that the name to be transliterated. Why Limonsol? Putting my detective hat on for a moment, I wonder if this could be a reference to the French energy drink Nocco, which comes in a Limon Del Sol flavor. Nocco is, of course, the name of another prominent gestral character. Cheers to that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still after more from Clair Obscur? One final update to the game arrived in December with new challenges and boss fights, and you can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/clair-obscur-expedition-33/Update_1.5.0_Patch_Notes">catch up on the full patch notes for Expedition 33's final update here</a>. Already though, of course, fans are already speculating what might come next, Sandfall has teased that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yes-another-clair-obscur-game-is-coming-expedition-33-is-one-of-the-stories-that-we-want-to-tell-in-this-franchise-teases-director">Clair Obscur is a "franchise name."</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <title><![CDATA[Code Vein 2: The Final Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/code-vein-2-the-final-preview</link>
            <guid>1397353</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">“Anime Souls” is a term often used to describe the original Code Vein. And while that is a very simple but fair descriptor – it is after all one of the very few soulslike games with an undeniably anime aesthetic – it also doesn’t really describe what was <em>actually </em>cool about the 2019 action RPG. For instance: the emotional storylines of your companion characters, delivered in these excellent sequences where you relive their most tragic memories; the phenomenal score by the wonderful Go Shiina; the flexible Blood Code system that allowed players to switch up their stats and playstyle without having to respect their whole character while also being able to pick and choose skills from other “classes.” There was certainly room for improvement in the core combat and level design, but it had great ideas, and would benefit from some refinement and iteration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s what Code Vein 2 seems to be all about: Refinement and iteration. Based on the three or so hours that I’ve played, Code Vein 2 felt familiar, but altogether much more confident and focused on the strengths of the original, while also getting off to an immediately more interesting start thanks to a brand new story with some intriguing time travel twists. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the first game, at the heart of Code Vein 2’s plot is a catastrophe that occurred many, many years ago. This time around, it’s known as the Resurgence, a calamity that corrupted everything it touched and gave rise to a new being known as a Revenant. Somehow, the Revenants managed to seal the Resurgence, but the victory was short-lived, as soon after, the Resurgence… well, surged again. This led to a battle that became known as the Upheaval, in which several heroes gave their lives to seal the Resurgence once again. One hundred years later, that seal is weakening, causing existence-erasing explosions all over the world, and this time, the means to save everything exists not in the present, but in the past. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And thus the stage is set for Code Vein 2’s time-hopping story that sees the nameless protagonist teaming up with Lou Magmell, a Revenant with the power to jump back and forth through time as they link up with the heroes of the past to try and find a way to stop the imminent world-ending threats of the future.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a pretty good hook! As someone who never really got invested in the world of Code Vein 1, outside of learning more about my companions, I was pretty happy that I was immediately invested this time around. I looked forward to seeing how the heroes of the past fought back against the Resurgence and what ultimately brought about their fates. I got a chance to ask Code Vein 2’s director, Hiroshi Yoshimura, if he looked to any specific sources of inspiration with regards to their interpretation of time travel, or the rules that govern it, and he said, “I wouldn’t say there’s one film or work in particular, but one golden rule that we had within the development was that once the player has observed or seen something happen within the game, then that becomes truth, or that becomes locked in the sense that it can’t be overturned.” </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Thicker Than Blood</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the gameplay side of things, much of the core of Code Vein 1 is still intact in the sequel. It’s still a stamina-governed combat system with a big focus on special abilities tied to various Blood Codes, which essentially determine your class or playstyle. Switching to a new Blood Code changes your stats, defense, and your max Ichor, which is essentially the mana that powers your special abilities. One of the interesting new twists of Blood Codes is that they also now come with a series of traits that can dramatically affect how you approach combat. For example, traditionally, the way combat works is you attack an enemy to inflict stacks of bleed, and then use a special technique known as a jail attack (previously known as “Drain Attacks”) to collect that blood, which then gets converted into the Ichor that you use to use your special skills.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pretty much every aspect of Code Vein 2's combat is more customizable than before. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But if that doesn’t sound like your style of play, you could instead use Josée’s Blood Code, which lets you gain Ichor simply by attacking, but that boon comes with a catch. If you gain more than your maximum Ichor, you take a significant chunk of damage. This was my preferred method of play, as it meant that I didn’t have to fish for opportunities to use my jail attacks to regain my Ichor, and it helped me be extra vigilant about using my abilities regularly so I didn’t end up overflowing with Ichor. Of course, my attention would occasionally wane, and this would occasionally be the death of me, but regardless, I appreciated the added twist to the gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, pretty much every aspect of Code Vein 2’s combat is more customizable than before. While Drain Attacks used to be tied to your Blood Codes, they’re now got their own equippable slot in your inventory, and there are a ton of different types. You’ve got the returning Ogre claw for a fast and short ranged option; Hounds for a powerful two-hitting mid-range attack; Stinger to nail enemies from afar; and then you’ve got a handful of completely new attacks like Ivy, which caused spikes to emerge from the ground and can be placed by charging the attack and moving the targeting circle; Bat, which causes you to grow wings and sends out a swarm of bats, and Reaper, which is a scythe that can be swung around to hit enemies in an AOE.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to Jails, you can also equip powerful subweapons known as Bequeathed Formae, and you can also choose a Defensive Formae as well.. With regards to the Bequeathed Formae, I only got to see two of these in my demo: a Battle Axe known as Idris’s Conceit, and a Longbow called Statesman’s Longbow. I opted more for a strength build throughout most of my demo time, so I primarily used the Battle Axe, and it certainly was a difference- maker in fights where I would get swarmed by enemies. All I needed to do was create some space to account for the lengthy windup, and boom. Once it hit, it would create a temporal field that slowed everything down, making it easy to clean up the survivors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Defensive Formae, you’re able to basically choose whether you want a standard block, a parry, or a dodge, with a couple of others thrown in there with some slight differences in how they perform. Im a huge fan of all these changes, as they allow even finer tuning of a build to your personal preference without becoming too overwhelming or complicated. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Big Question</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most common things that always gets discussed anytime there’s a new soulslike in town is how difficult it is, so let’s talk about it. For the most part, I got through this demo without much issue. Granted, this was a provided save, so it’s hard to say how things would have been if I got to this point on my own playthrough with my own loadout, but Bandai Namco was very generous in giving us a wide selection of weapons, Blood Codes, and jails, and I never felt like I was particularly under- or overlevelled. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Code Vein 2 also smartly lets you decide on whether you want your companion to follow you and participate in combat like an AI coop partner, or whether you’d prefer to have them be assimilated into you, providing you with specific buffs, but without giving you the benefit of another body to deal damage or distract enemies. It’s a great trade-off that allows Code Vein 2 to maintain the companion element that makes it such a distinct soulslike in the first place, while also allowing players who enjoy tackling these challenges as a solo player to do so without feeling like they’re being severely punished.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Where the difficulty really turned up several notches was in the two boss battles that I got to experience.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Where the difficulty really turned up several notches was in the two boss battles that I got to experience. These were true tests of skills and reflexes and took nearly half of my allotted three hours of playtime, and that’s without even delivering the final blow against the second one. The first boss could simply wipe out my health with just one or two hits, while also afflicting me with the acid status effect, which would deal damage over time. My windows to punish were very small, making me opt for a strength-oriented build so I could land a powerful and chargeable overhead slash with my greatsword to make the most out of those opportunities. Eventually, I prevailed, only to be hard stuck against the second boss. This boss was fast, had an extremely dangerous second phase that I didn’t get to see enough of to really learn its new attacks, and had the nasty habit of electrifying the floor and inflicting bind on me, which would paralyze me long enough for the boss to land another free attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the difficulty spike, I loved both these encounters, and while I'm a bit salty that I couldn’t finish the job at the preview event, I’m looking forward to the runback once I get the full game in my hands and can attempt the boss with my own personal build. Overall, Code Vein 2 is shaping up to be a marked improvement over the original in just about every area. We’ll see if Bandai Namco is able to stick the landing when this soulslike sequel releases on January 30, 2026 for PlayStation 5,  Xbox Series X|S, and PC. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.
