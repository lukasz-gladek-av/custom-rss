Amazon is offering two INIU branded power banks at just over $10:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/916gNR?object_uuid=83d313b0-328b-4448-a905-abcfc873ff09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">INIU 10,000mAh 22.5W USB Power Bank</a> for $11.59 with code: "<strong>CCPUVQ4A</strong>"</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/znXLrG?object_uuid=83d313b0-328b-4448-a905-abcfc873ff09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">INIU 10,000mAh 22.5W USB Power Bank</a> for $12.58 with code: "<strong>L6FIOIAI</strong>"</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">INIU power banks generally have very good reviews and are considerably less expensive than equivalent Anker models. These two models have the same battery capacity and power delivery output, but the $11.58 model has two USB Type-C and one USB Type-A ports. The $12.58 model has one USB Type-C and two USB Type-A ports and a battery indicator.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">INIU 10,000mAh 22.5W Power Banks</h2><div id="213945" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="97fbf52d-392a-4fd5-b10f-ab8444983cbb"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU 10,000mAh 22.5W Power Bank</h3></p></div><div catalogid="97fbf52d-392a-4fd5-b10f-ab8444983cbb" id="213946"><div id="213946" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU 10,000mAh 22.5W Power Bank</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two reasons why these power banks serve as great battery backups for your Nintendo Switch console: capacity and charging rate. A 10,000mAh (37Whr) power bank can charge a Nintendo Switch OLED from completely empty to full about 1.9 times while still managing a slim footprint. Provided you fully charge your Switch from the get-go, that nearly triples your total playtime. Both power banks also boast a 22.5W charging output over USB Type-C. The Nintendo Switch console accepts a maximum charging rate of 18W, which is the charging rate of the official Nintendo charger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a power bank this small, you don't need to worry about being stopped at airports. The 10,000mAh capacity is well below TSA's 27,000mAh carry-on limit. Both power banks also also low-profile enough that no one will take notice in the first place. If a TSA official actually does take the initiative to test the wattage, you are well in the clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for more options?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-confirms-nerfs-and-buffs-coming-with-season-1-balance-changes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals Season 1 balance changes are nearly here, and NetEase Games has revealed details that promise tweaks for popular heroes like Captain America, Cloak &amp; Dagger, and Jeff the Land Shark.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team detailed its reasoning for the buffs and nerfs that will soon be delivered with version 20250110 in <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250108/41548_1205103.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post on its website</u></a>. Despite having launched only last month, NetEase says it’s happy with the “vibrant diversity of lineups” it has seen this far but still sees some room for improvement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hence, in the first half of Season 1, we are set to make balance adjustments to certain heroes, enabling a broader roster to partake in more intricate gameplay, ensuring a richer, more engaging, and diverse gaming experience for all,” the team explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the balance tweaks arriving in the first half of Marvel Rivals Season 1 include slight nerfs to a few of the more dominant heroes in the roster. Hulk’s Indestructible Guard gamma shield is going from 250 to 200 health, while Hela will be hit with a base health reduction that brings her from 275 to 250. Hawkeye is also getting a decrease to his medium-long range damage alongside a slight increase to his close combat resistance. Then there's Luna Snow, whose ultimate ability will now take longer to switch from damage to healing.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The list of heroes set to benefit from buffs, meanwhile, is quite long, with Cloak &amp; Dagger, Storm, Punisher, Moon Knight, and more due improvements in some form. Captain America is getting some of the more substantial balance adjustments, with NetEase aiming to enhance his survivability. Jeff’s Joyful Splash healing is also getting an increase from 140/s to 150/s, while the team has also moved to make his ultimate ability warning marker line up better with its actual radius.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-details-the-fantastic-four-new-maps-and-mode-coming-in-season-1">Marvel Rivals Season 1</a> launches this Friday, January 10. In an <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1877053617435455855" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>X/Twitter post</u></a>, NetEase announced that a maintenance period will begin tomorrow, January 9, starting from 11pm to 1.10am PST. Servers go offline during this time, with the team warning that server return times may vary based on progress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside today’s patch notes, NetEase revealed what it is calling the Hero Hot List, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-hero-stats-reveal-pick-and-win-rates-in-quickplay-and-competitive-modes">stat page that details pick and win rates for heroes</a> across console and PC quickplay and competitive matches. It’s a list that will almost certainly change with Season 1 not only because of the balance adjustments but the introduction of four new heroes with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fantastic-four-confirmed-for-marvel-rivals-in-official-first-look-image">Fantastic Four</a>. Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman start things off with the first half of the season, with The Thing and Human Torch set to arrive in the second half.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can read the full balance changes planned to arrive in the first half of Marvel Rivals Season 1 below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Marvel Rivals First Half of Season 1 Balance Changes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>VANGUARD</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Captain America</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Steve will receive some enhanced survivability, allowing more frequent entering and exiting of the combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Reduce the delay time for shield restoration after releasing Living Legend from 3s to 2s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Reduce Liberty Rush cooldown from 12s to 10s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Increase base health from 650 to 675.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Reduce the energy cost for releasing Freedom Charge (ultimate ability) from 3400 to 3100; Reduce the additional health provided per second to self after releasing it from 110 to 100.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Doctor Strange</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll be reducing the threat range and increasing the defense window of the Sorcerer Supreme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Add damage falloff to Maelstrom of Madness and Gamma Maelstrom.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-hero-stats-reveal-pick-and-win-rates-in-quickplay-and-competitive-modes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">No love for Storm as players continue to flock to Jeff.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase Games has unveiled a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes_data/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hero Hot List for Marvel Rivals</a>, revealing pick and win rates for everyone from Jeff the Land Shark and Mantis to Storm and Spider-Man.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a straightforward list of every playable character in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-a-smash-hit-with-10-million-players-in-just-3-days"><u>massively popular</u></a> hero shooter that gives players more insight into which Marvel icons are being picked over the others. You probably won’t be too surprised to see Jeff leading the pack as the number-one pick across PC and console quickplay games. He’s sitting at 21.18% pick rate, with Venom in second at 19.09% and Cloak &amp; Dagger in third at 18.81%. At the opposite end of the list, we find Storm, with only 1.66% of players choosing to smite opponents with her weather abilities in quickplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pick rates for competitive, meanwhile, tell a slightly different story. Pop-centric healer and Strategist Luna Snow tops the pick rate list at 20.66%, with Jeff still cracking the top 10 in seventh with 13.86%. The tough-to-handle Storm remains at the bottom in competitive games at just 0.69% on PC, while Black Widow sits in last with 0.79% in competitive console matches. It also seems that the Strategist and Vanguard roles remain equally popular among players regardless of mode or platform.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Concrete numbers for Marvel Rivals show NetEase is willing to be a bit more transparent about how fans are choosing to engage with the roster, but many will likely find little surprise in the pick rate list. Jeff, specifically, has proven to be quite the punching bag for the community since launch arrived last month. This adorable dog shark has terrorized enemy teams with his It’s Jeff! Ultimate ability, which sees him swallowing multiple enemies and, usually, sending them hurtling to their deaths. He’s relatively easy to get a handle on, so it’s never been a surprise to see him show up in a match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Win rates, on the other hand, reveal that Marvel Rivals has been a mostly even experience regardless of which hero players dive into battle with. While nearly every character hovers around a 50% win rate regardless of game mode, Jeff actually finds himself on the lower end of the spectrum at 45.39% of matches won in quickplay and 44.38% in competitive. It’s actually Mantis who brings home the most consistent victories, with 56% of games won in quickplay and 55.20% won in competitive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of these stats may give players clues as to how NetEase will push forward when it comes to future balance changes. That said, those pick rates will certainly change once <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-details-the-fantastic-four-new-maps-and-mode-coming-in-season-1"><u>Season 1</u></a> introduces new maps, modes, and characters, such as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fantastic-four-confirmed-for-marvel-rivals-in-official-first-look-image"><u>Fantastic Four</u></a>, starting this Friday, January 10.
