The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h45Sr1kafGU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>resulting video</u></a> is quite funny, showing the new Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) family as they fumble through a few matches as their in-game counterparts.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Meet the family! ✨Marvel Studios The Fantastic Four: First Steps cast's genuine reactions as they try out Marvel Rivals! 😄 <a href="https://t.co/sq8lwMh7pp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/sq8lwMh7pp</a></p>— Marvel Rivals (@MarvelRivals) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/1948513591134679137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's goofy and occasionally hard to watch as Pascal flails his stretchy arms at enemies, but the highlight is no doubt the Fantastic Four cast’s reaction to Invisible Woman’s infamous Marvel Rivals Malice skin. Fans of the game had already taken the time to see everything the shockingly revealing outfit had to offer when it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/marvel-rivals/Season_1_Battle_Pass_and_New_Skins#Malice_Invisible_Woman_Skin">its debut with Season 1</a> in January. On the eve of the new Fantastic Four movie’s premiere, though, the cast is only just seeing it for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby is the first to joke about the skin: “Thank you. This is my favorite bit of her as well,” she says of the video game version of her Fantastic Four character. “This is my favorite bit. Guys, watch out, like I said, for the sequel. You better watch it.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fantastic Four: First Steps, of course, has yet to receive the green light for a proper MCU sequel, though we do know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-pedro-pascals-reed-richards-lead-the-avengers-the-fantastic-four-first-steps-director-clarifies-previous-comments-insists-its-for-the-russo-brothers-to-reveal"><u>at least some of its major characters</u></a> will make an appearance in the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday. Invisible Woman’s evil black-and-red Malice skin probably won’t make it into the MCU, but the slack-jawed Pascal still shared some of his thoughts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Here we go,” Pascal said. “Costume designer, take notes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Loserfruit’s video also includes the Fantastic Four cast’s reaction to other Marvel Rivals cosmetics, including Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman’s The Life Fantastic wedding skins. Of course, it’s how all four actors reacted to the Malice skin that has started to achieve viral status. You can see the group's reaction at 4:40 in Loserfruit's video and then see how it's spread to the internet below.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/8n9dQItgZq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/8n9dQItgZq</a></p>— 🏆- Christian (@Braves246) <a href="https://twitter.com/Braves246/status/1948513963584487646?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Their reaction when they saw Sue's Malice skin 😭💀 <a href="https://t.co/tFQ7kAvlGq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/tFQ7kAvlGq</a></p>— Suebi ⓸ (@wasabitoffee) <a href="https://twitter.com/wasabitoffee/status/1948411685297103052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Fantastic Four: First Steps officially lands in theaters tomorrow, July 25, and will introduce the first new live-action take on Marvel’s First Family in a decade.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The best of both worlds for backers and creators.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a surprising turn of events, Indiegogo, one of the largest global crowdfunding platforms second only to Kickstarter, has been acquired by board game crowdfunding site Gamefound.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/blog/post/gamefound-acquires-indiegogo?ref=info-banner_1-152" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joint announcement</a>, Gamefound revealed it will be integrating its technology to enhance the Indiegogo platform, offering creators and backers more powerful tools than ever before. These include over 20 payment options, a full-featured mobile app, built-in marketing tools, and more robust pledge management. Indiegogo will also adopt Gamefound's flat 5% fee structure, putting more money in creators' pockets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s time for crowdfunding to be a forward-facing industry again,” said Julie dePontbriand, CEO of Indiegogo in the official release. “Gamefound’s technology is unrivaled, and we’re thrilled to bring it to Indiegogo’s diverse community. Together, we’re making crowdfunding more innovative, creator-friendly, and exciting than ever before.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two sites will continue operating independently for now, with Gamefound remaining focused on tabletop games and Indiegogo continuing to promote tech, film, and other creative projects. In the near future, Gamefound campaigns will also be discoverable through Indiegogo, opening the door to a much broader audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiegogo is one of the original crowdfunding pioneers, having launched over 17 years ago. In that time, it has amassed 38 million members and raised more than $3 billion for projects across the globe. By combining Indiegogo’s global reach with Gamefound’s cutting-edge infrastructure, the partnership might finally give Kickstarter a run for its money.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What does this mean for the board game industry?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, this acquisition is a massive win for the board game industry. Gamefound will soon be cross-promoting its tabletop campaigns through Indiegogo, allowing creators to get in front of millions of new customers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With fewer fees and more native tools to help promote projects, creators may finally start shifting away from Kickstarter for new campaigns. Since Gamefound doesn't have a paid promotion feature like Kickstarter Boost, it levels the playing field for smaller creators, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Large publishers are already favoring Gamefound, with six of the ten <a href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/520142/gamefound-top-10-biggest-board-game-crowdfund-campaigns" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largest board game projects in 2024</a> successfully funded there, including the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-the-board-game-funded-in-10-minutes">Cyberpunk 2077 board game that reached its goal in ten minutes</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matthew Adler has written for IGN since 2019 covering all things gaming, tech, tabletop games, and more.
