That's smaller compared to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/Cyberpunk_2077_Download_Size">Xbox or PS5 (100-110GB)</a>, but for Switch 2, 64GB is a whopping 25% of the console's confirmed 256GB of internal storage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Launching on the same day as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-confirmed-during-nintendo-direct">Switch 2, June 5</a>, Cyberpunk 2077 will be available as a physical 64GB game card or as a digital download from the Nintendo eShop. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo also recently confirmed that several new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-game-cards-will-only-include-a-download-key">Switch 2 game cards won’t always carry an actual game</a>, but instead contain a key for a game download. This isn't the case for Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, this also begs the question: how quickly will a Switch 2's internal storage fill up?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-supports-120fps-up-to-4k-resolution-docked">Switch 2's 256GB internal storage</a> is a big step up from the original Switch’s 32GB. However, early signs already suggest Switch 2 games will be much larger. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077, like we've mentioned, is a 64GB download. By comparison, one of the biggest games on the original Switch, Tears of the Kingdom, was just 16GB. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-nintendo-switch-games-are-getting-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-including-breath-of-the-wild-and-metroid-prime-4">Switch 2 version</a>—and other titles like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-costs-80-30-cheaper-if-you-buy-it-bundled-with-the-nintendo-switch-2">$80 Mario Kart World</a>—will likely demand significantly more space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The obvious solution? Expandable storage. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-ssd">PS5 has it</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssds-for-xbox-series-xs">Xbox has it</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-sd-cards-for-nintendo-switch">Switch has always supported it</a>. But unlike the original Switch, which accepted standard microSD, microSDHC, and microSDXC cards, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-game-cards-will-only-include-a-download-key">Switch 2 is locked to microSD Express</a>. That means your old microSD cards won’t work, and more importantly, you’ll need to buy new, notably pricier memory cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can tell, IGN’s deals team has already tracked down the best prices on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-microsd-express-cards-where-to-buy">Switch 2-compatible microSD Express cards</a>, including <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPp5EV?object_uuid=c261c5f9-8f6b-4fb0-95dc-698a4c23b7b8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">128GB</a> ($44.99), <a href="https://zdcs.link/aewqoJ?object_uuid=c261c5f9-8f6b-4fb0-95dc-698a4c23b7b8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">256GB </a>($59.99), <a href="https://zdcs.link/9lXGRE?object_uuid=c261c5f9-8f6b-4fb0-95dc-698a4c23b7b8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">512GB</a> ($99.99), and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPp55W?object_uuid=c261c5f9-8f6b-4fb0-95dc-698a4c23b7b8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1TB versions</a> ($199.99) options from SanDisk and Lexar. However, some are already being snapped up in bulk and are now listed as "temporarily out of stock" on Amazon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is also partnering with SanDisk and Samsung to release its own branded cards, though if history is any indication, expect them to be more expensive than identical third-party versions. It’s also possible more manufacturers will jump into the microSD Express market now that the Switch 2 is driving demand, but whether that leads to lower prices remains to be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Switch 2, you can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">everything from the Nintendo Direct right here</a>, and read our full guide on how to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-start-time">secure your preorder for the Switch 2</a> on April 9.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Senior Editor, Commerce, for IGN.

This distinction serves as a powerful reminder that the challenge we embraced continues to resonate with and inspire so many people even today. It is truly the greatest of encouragement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Above all, we would like to express our heartfelt thanks to the fans around the world who have continued to love and support Shenmue," Suzuki added.
