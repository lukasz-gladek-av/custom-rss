            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> Season 1 is here, and players have already turned their attention to one major issue: Blackwell Fields.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The California sun-soaked fields of EA and Battlefield Studios’ first new post-launch map are home to an army of oil pumpjacks, smoky hills, and an orange tint that blankets every scrap of metal and radio tower. It also happens to be what some believe is “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oiq7iq/hands_down_the_worst_map_in_the_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>hands down the worst map in the game</u></a>” if not “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi8psv/man_this_is_the_worst_map_in_bf_history_i_cant/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the worst map in BF history</u></a>.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This week's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-trailer-highlights-blackwell-fields-and-eastwood-maps-ahead-of-next-weeks-launch"><u>Season 1 launch</u></a> was meant to be the first in a long line of exciting moments for Battlefield players. Instead, it’s kicked off seasonal updates on a sour note, as fans flock to criticize Blackwell Fields as a wasteland that suffers from a lack of cover for infantry and vehicles alike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I can't count the amount of times I spawn on this map and instantly have direct vision of the enemies capturing points,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi8psv/comment/nltl0qp/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>dissatisfied Battlefield 6 player</u></a> said. “You get shot at from every angle on this map, there's never a break. People can just spawn and start shooting you straight away.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"My playstyle is engineer class and I blow up armored vehicles, but I cant even get into cover in this map without getting shot from ALL sides," another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oiq7iq/hands_down_the_worst_map_in_the_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popular post</a> explained. "The massive open areas makes it a sniper haven and every other class is just trashed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite its relatively large battles, Battlefield 6’s Conquest mode seems to suffer the most when it comes to Blackwell Fields, as players report facing enemy fire from as far away as enemy HQ spawn points. Pilots for air vehicles, specifically, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi7tgc/blackwell_fields_enemy_base_aa_shoots_you_while/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> having a hard time on the new Season 1 map. Despite being considered one of the larger maps Battlefield 6 has to offer, opponents with the right hardware can still lock onto some jets before they’ve even taken off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is fantastic,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi7tgc/comment/nltejew/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user</u></a> jokes. “I was hoping for more maps where Helis are useless.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No no, they are perfect nice garage helicopters,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi7tgc/comment/nlthu77/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user</u></a> teases. “You keep them nice and clean in the hangar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's not helicopter season yet.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These Blackwell Fields balance issues only add fuel to the fire that is the conversation surrounding map sizes in Battlefield 6, but many have expressed dissatisfaction with the map regardless of game mode. Even smaller objective-based game modes in downsized versions of Blackwell Fields still feature those orange visuals, leading to even more chaotic moments as bullets fly through dense environments obscured by smoke.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I played a round of breakthrough which was decent and one of conquest which was a disaster,” one <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/0/599667545349564587/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam user</u></a> commented. “The visibility is already so bad in this game no matter what settings you use, the red/orange tint that this map have it's a disaster.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although the <a href="https://x.com/L0SSY/status/1983322555940516260" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>stray comment</u></a> praising Blackwell Fields and its cinematic feel can be found if you look hard enough, it seems most players online would trade atmosphere if it meant BF Studios would fix what they feel are one-sided battles and suffocating gun fights. Of course, it’s only been one day since Season 1 launched for Battlefield 6, so opinions could shift after they spend more time with the new map.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Me on Blackwell fields <a href="https://t.co/03GkOb6pAd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/03GkOb6pAd</a></p>— Lou (@louallen026) <a href="https://twitter.com/louallen026/status/1983213456758063388?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 28, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear if Blackwell Fields will receive any changes, but EA and BF Studios have proven to be responsive when it comes to fan feedback so far. Even if Blackwell Fields continues to be a sore spot for the community, Season 1 will at least deliver a new, less orange map in the form of Eastwood come November 18.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Numerous updates, big and small, have arrived since Battlefield 6 launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X  and S October 10.
