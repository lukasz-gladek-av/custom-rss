            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Christmas is magical, so buy Magic: The Gathering. Sorry, couldn't think of a better way to open up today's Daily Deals, so there you go. Terrible openers aside, there's some cracking bargains to be had on MTG Universes Beyond and proper, and I've compared pricing on a load of sealed products to make sure you're getting the best price. Additionally, you can see the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-magic-the-gathering-gift-ideas">best MTG gift ideas</a> or more of IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/best-gift-ideas">gift guides</a> for any last-minute shopping needs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are the best gaming and tech deals available now, AKA the day before Christmas Eve!</p><p id="tldr-deals-for-today"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TL;DR: Deals for Today">TL;DR: Best Deals Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sweet spot seems to be getting a product on Amazon that is cheapest or at market value, as you're getting a bargain and should <strong>get it delivered before Christmas Day</strong>. If you are looking to get some MTG by then, I wouldn't wait around, as this is likely the final day to get something delivered before a round man breaks into your home, eats your food, and leaves you something nice under your tree. Let's get into it:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save up to 50% on Webroot Cybersecurity Plan - Includes VPN, Antivirus, Identity Theft Protection &amp; More</h2><div catalogid="bc0e7f43-d26a-4642-b84f-939b2357eccd" id="233791"><p data-cy="paragraph">For when Santa's not the only one watching you...</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Any time is the right time to ensure you’re doing everything right to protect yourself online from cybercriminals. Webroot is the all-in-one cybersecurity software, offering its Webroot basic software subscription <em>and</em> its Webroot Total Protection subscription at 50% off for the holiday season. Plans start at $89.99/year for newbies, which isn't bad considering everything you get: Identity and antivirus protection, privacy protection (VPN for up to 10 devices), and data protection (unlimited cloud backup).</p></div><p id="mtg-cheapest-at-amazon"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG Cheapest at Amazon">MTG Cheapest at Amazon</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seeing MTG: Fallout Commander decks for under market value on Amazon right now is kind of surprising, considering Fallout Season 2 has dropped, but here we are. It's a cracking last-minute bundle for you and three loved ones to play a themed game of Commander.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Want to play Commander at a cheaper price point? The Bloomburrow Commander deck bundle is down to $124.98, which is great value. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you really want to build out your Commander game, the Commander Masters Set and Draft Booster boxes are below market value right now too, at $447.20 and $366.47, respectively.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save up to 60% on Jüced Energy Gummies (Peach Flavor)</h2><div catalogid="f25b5f04-963c-4c9e-a597-1fc53445488b" id="233848"><p data-cy="paragraph">From the makers of Grüns, meet Jüced. Unlike other energy boosters, it doesn't cause beta-alanine tingles that make you feel like itchy or as if something's under your skin. Here are the deets on this new, trendy pre-workout gummy:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>95mg of natural caffeine</li><li>Doesn’t cause beta-alanine tingles or niacin flushes*</li><li>Ingredients in Jüced support both immediate energy and long-term training benefits</li><li>6g of fiber to support digestion*</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>** Full details </em><a href="https://go.linkby.com/NEBUCPPW" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>here</em></a></p></div><p id="mtg-at-market-value-on-amazon"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG At Market Value on Amazon">MTG at Market Value on Amazon</h2></p><div><div id="233830" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At Market Value on Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Avatar: The Last Airbender Play Booster Box</h3></p></div><div id="233833" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At Market Value on Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Outlaws of Thunder Junction Play Booster Box</h3></p></div><div id="233841" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At Market Value on Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Avatar: The Last Airbender Collector Booster Box</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Avatar: The Last Airbender Play Booster Box has dropped by $15 from its preorder listing and is in line with current secondary market listings on TCGPlayer. Surprisingly, the Collector Booster Box is also at market value on Amazon too, which is an MTG product that is usually well over the odds at the big box retailer.</p><p id="mtg-cheapest-at-tcgplayer"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG Cheapest at TCGPlayer">MTG Cheapest at TCGPlayer</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The crown for the overall best pricing on Magic: The Gathering sealed products however goes to TCGPlayer, that includes preorders for Teenage Mutant Turtles Play Booster Box and Lorwyn Eclipsed Play Booster Box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Chocobo Bundle is a nice deal at $173.79, which includes a 12-card Chocobo booster pack, a traditional art foil promo card, a borderless Final Fantasy scene card (there's 24 to collect), 32 FF landmark-themed Land cards, click wheel life counter and a Chocobo Edition card box. </p><p id="pokmon-tcg-price-check"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG Price Check">Pokémon TCG Price Check</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair to Amazon, some of their pricing isn't far off market price, but then again they're being undercut by independent businesses and sellers that will likely have worse rates from distribution than Amazon. Read between the lines there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So Phantasmal Flames ETB is <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXV3jO?object_uuid=5c7863e4-ca21-46ed-9a2e-95fac1bc86b7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$79.94 at Amazon</a>, just shy of $4 more than <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLMqER?object_uuid=5c7863e4-ca21-46ed-9a2e-95fac1bc86b7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGPlayers $76</a>. Mega Evolutions Three Booster Blister is in a similar spot on Amazon right now too, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aADZEL?object_uuid=5c7863e4-ca21-46ed-9a2e-95fac1bc86b7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$29.54</a> compared to <a href="https://zdcs.link/a01jRr?object_uuid=5c7863e4-ca21-46ed-9a2e-95fac1bc86b7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$28.93 on TCGPlayer</a>. But if you're after Mega Evolutions Boosters, i'd suggest going on TCGPlayer and buying single sleeved ones for <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2ldP?object_uuid=5c7863e4-ca21-46ed-9a2e-95fac1bc86b7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$8.70 each</a> instead.</p><p id="bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night">Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is Free Today Only at Epic Games Store</h2></p><div catalogid="f25b5f04-963c-4c9e-a597-1fc53445488b" id="233846"><div id="233846" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/25/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-review">Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night Review, rated 8.8/10,</a> Daemon Hatfield says the game plays and feels like the legendary Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, but with new heroes and villains to keep it interesting.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">007 First light</a> is delayed two months for “further polish,” developer and publisher IO Interactive has announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The James Bond adventure video game was due out March 27, 2026, but will now release on May 27, 2026. In <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2003511022141817016" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a statement published online</a>, IOI said the delay would ensure it was able to deliver “the strongest possible version at launch.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that 007 First Light’s new release date is just a day after Grand Theft Auto 6 was due to be released before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">its latest delay</a> to November 19, 2026. Essentially, IOI has snapped up the release slot left vacant by Rockstar’s behemoth.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">007 First Light was thought to have benefited from the GTA 6 delay, coming out at the time just two months before GTA 6’s prior release date. In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-io-interactive-interview-hakan-abrak-on-james-bond-dispatch-and-the-gta-6-delay" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesIndustry.biz</u></a> from last month, IOI CEO Hakan Abrak was asked about GTA 6 kindly getting out of 007’s way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It would be a lie not to say that obviously spring looks really good,” he replied. “I want to say in the same breath that GTA 6 is a welcome thing for the industry. I do believe a lot of gamers who maybe haven't played for a while will get into things again, and generally for the industry as a whole, I think that will be amazing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clearly, GTA 6’s delay has given IOI even more room to breathe, and it’s snapped that extra time up to  give 007 First Light the best chance possible of having a strong launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
