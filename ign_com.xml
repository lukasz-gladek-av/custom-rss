Each detail of this wrist-mounted computer remains faithful to the game. A fully functional IPS display delivers that vintage cathode ray tube look, complete with screen glitches and a huge gallery of media, including the Atomic Command minigame. The Wand Company spared no expense when creating this replica, from its die-cast metal front casing and memory foam cuff with a spacer to a rechargeable LiPo power cell and LED torch. It’s sure to elevate your cosplay to another level, but the included machined metal stand is ideal for displaying this exhibition-grade collectible — or using the Pip-Boy 3000 as an alarm clock; yes, it does that too. </p></div><p id="new-vegas-ranger-statue"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="New Vegas Ranger Statue">Fallout New Vegas Ranger Statue</h2></p><div catalogid="84737b41-6a12-4e0e-9a1a-40bee8f54287" id="230124"><div id="230124" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout New Vegas Ranger Statue</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The detail is incredible on this 8.4-inch resin statue of a New Vegas Ranger.

Nuka Mix isn’t the only Nuka-Cola flavor available; Bethesda’s Gear Store has a bunch of other kinds for an epic Nuka Mix Station at home.</p></div><p id="desert-ranger-battle-helmet"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Desert Ranger Battle Helmet">Fallout Desert Ranger Battle Wearable Helmet</h2></p><div catalogid="84737b41-6a12-4e0e-9a1a-40bee8f54287" id="230123"><div id="230123" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout Desert Ranger Battle Wearable Helmet</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Before the <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/New_California_Republic_Rangers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New California Republic Rangers</a> formed, there were the Desert Rangers, and you can grab a piece of their history with a durable plastic helmet modeled after one found in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>. It’s hand-painted with weathered detail to make each helmet unique. A green glow even comes from the eyes, thanks to the inclusion of LED lights. Best of all, this helmet is wearable for some epic cosplay, and it comes with a stand for displaying. An enamel pin of a completely geared-up Desert Ranger is also included.

You’ll find a 20L interior compartment, a laptop slot, pockets for various accessories, and, of course, the thick signature yellow blanket that rests on top.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Haha. Yeah, I know. "Half-Life 3". The long-fabled, often-rumored, still non-existent third numbered entry in the Half-Life series that fans have craved but never heard a credible whisper of. It's been a pervasive joke in the industry and among fans for years, a stand-in for a thing that doesn't exist and never would.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet, for some reason, a lot of people seem to think it's being announced soon. Possibly in the next few weeks. Maybe even today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might have seen it. The sudden flurry of mentions of Half-Life 3, some humorous, some quite serious. The surge of memes. A handful of people that seem to have lost their dang minds:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Update 1:09pm PT:</strong> Originally, I had included several embeds of Reddit posts of people desperately praying and begging for a Half-Life 3 announcement. However, the r/halflife mods appear to be removing them, seemingly due to the subreddit's rule against "low-value submissions", aka memes, and perhaps due to the sheer volume of these posts recently. These have subsequently been replaced by more posts wishing for Half-Life 3 - honestly, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just check out the subreddit</a>, I'm sure you'll see some good ones that haven't been deleted yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Original story continues below:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what's going on? Why do people think Half-Life 3 is imminent, seriously or unseriously? We investigated:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Half-Hope</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Half-Life 3 rumors have existed pretty much since Half-Life 2 first released, so that's nothing new. But the last couple of years have seen a steady trickle of interesting little threads that have lead many to believe that a third entry was actually in development, quietly, at Valve. There were vague nods, such as the Half-Life: Alyx team <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-half-life-alyx-sequel">saying they wanted to make more Half-Life games</a> and a Final Hours documentary that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-left-4-dead-3-details-cancelled-valve">actually confirmed it was in development at one point</a> between 2013 and 2014. We've also seen dataminers pulling crumbs from various Valve releases over the last few years of what seems to be an in-development game internally at Valve <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">known only as "HLX",</a> using Source 2. Dataminers have worked out that it's a full-fledged, non-VR, Half-Life game of some sort, that's been in the works since at least 2021, probably earlier. That game is possibly the same one as was accidentally leaked by a voice actor in 2024, who referred to it as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Project White Sands"</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But this year there's been a marked increase in little breadcrumbs. Right after the new year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-rumors-ramp-up-after-g-man-voice-actor-issues-cryptic-tweet-his-first-in-years">G-Man's voice actor issued a cryptic post</a> teasing "unexpected surprises" in 2025 – it was his first tweet since he congratulated Valve on Half-Life: Alyx in December 2020. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-fans-are-doing-a-gta-6-and-losing-their-minds-over-hidden-half-life-3-clues-they-desperately-want-to-be-real">Fans proceeded to tear apart the post</a>, delving deep into an album cover image and the number 197 for what they believed were even more hints that something was in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But an already simmering pot of rumors turned into a full boil with the announcement last week of new Valve hardware: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-machine-hands-on-first-impressions">the Steam Machine</a>, complete with a new Steam controller, and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-frame-preview-hands-on-with-valves-state-of-the-art-vr-headset">VR headset known as the Steam Frame</a>. Notably, there were no software announcements alongside these hardware reveals, which is a bit odd given that Valve tends to release new games alongside new hardware - recall Half-Life: Alyx and the Valve Index headset. Around the same time, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1ox4jzk/more_hopium/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a number</a> of Valve and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/uwn_XYk8Is8?t=2122s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">industry insiders</a> began mentioning Half-Life 3, saying confidently that it was planned for a 2025 announcement still. One leaker, who has a good track record of getting Valve stuff right, said back in May that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-is-not-just-in-development-its-now-playable-end-to-end-leaker-suggests" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Half-Life 3 was officially "playable, end-to-end."</a> There's a <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVINqBTwM=/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">massive Miro board floating around</a> that has catalogued every remotely credible recent mention of Half-Life 3, and is worth digging into if you want follow along.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Go, G-Man, Go</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There are so many other weird little indicators floating around that are leading to wild speculation. For instance, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/valve" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve's "Upcoming Releases" tab</a> on its own Steam page only lists one game (Deadlock) despite the sidebar indicating that there are <em>two</em> upcoming game releases. A <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1991101144207085644?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet/X post</a> from the official The Game Awards account commemorating Half-Life's 27th anniversary today has sent everyone into a frenzy, even though it tweets this anniversary every year. There was a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/820533/valve-secrecy-security-guards-steam-machine-valve-hq-no-hl3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weird amount of extra security at Valve</a> during the recent Steam hardware preview events – something noticed by IGN's own representatives and contrasted with my personal experience there for Half-Life: Alyx years ago, which featured a relatively normal and relaxed amount of security.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there was an incredibly silly saga where <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1990519287032000600?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geoff Keighley posted a screenshot</a> that showed he had one game in his Steam wishlist. When <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1990526450005651771?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked what the game was</a>, he responded with an eyes emoji, and then <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1990894100531306531?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showed the game Dadlympics</a>. Of course, the Half-Life nerds pounced. Keighley then posted a screenshot of his wishlist showing only the game "Dadlympics," but notably, this was added on 11/18, the same day he posted the screenshot, suggesting he's hiding <em>something.</em> Is he hiding Half-Life 3? Probably not! It doesn't have a viewable Steam page! That's not how Steam works! But that hasn't stopped Half-Life 3 fans from pouncing. Seriously, the replies are hilarious.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/t5L0zHW0Il" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/t5L0zHW0Il</a></p>— arda (@lornarcoss) <a href="https://twitter.com/lornarcoss/status/1990682190263251432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever you believe is happening here, the reality is that this has resulted in the community going completely bonkers. The Half-Life subreddit is overflowing with Half-Life 3 summoning and hope posts. A quick search for Half-Life on Twitter/X reveals an overflow of discourse, prayers, and memes. It's kind of nuts, and also really, really fun:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, so let's say everyone's right, and we really are getting Half-Life 3 announced soon. When? Well, some think it's as soon as today. November 19, as The Game Awards posted, is the anniversary of Half-Life – what better time to make an announcement? We've already passed the anniversary of Half-Life 2, and the anniversary of Half-Life: Alyx's announcement, but that particular anniversary is the reason you're likely seeing so much noise around this today. The other big possibility floated by some is an announcement at The Game Awards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-collects-12-the-game-awards-nominations-the-most-in-the-awards-history">which is coming up on December 11</a>. That would be a little surprising, given that Valve doesn't need an awards show to command attention with such an announcement. But Valve also has a long history of friendliness with host Geoff Keighley, so maybe it's not so far-fetched after all.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever the case, one thing is certain: either Half-Life 3 is getting announced before December 31, 2025, or an awful lot of folks are going to have egg on their faces come January 1, 2026. I'm personally hoping for the former, but the community has been hoodwinked before with Half-Life rumors, multiple times even. Keep injecting that Hopium, folks. Perhaps the return of G-man is right around the corner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social.

As explained by Peter Amato, Content Manager at publisher 2K in a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/19/mafia-the-old-countrys-free-ride-update-launches-november-20/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, Mafia: The Old Country’s Free Ride update is a collection of challenges separate from the main story that give players chances to revisit the world in a “more self-guided way.” Veteran fans of the series will find that Mafia: The Old Country’s Free Ride mode will be slightly different from previous titles as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The repeatable challenges include combat, stealth, and different race types. Completing them earns you the Dinari in-game currency to spend on the new outfits, charms, weapons, and vehicles unlocked by progressing through this content (as well as on items unlocked via the campaign).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want players to explore the world in a freeform way, and Free Ride turns it into an expansive hub where you’ll find and access various challenges by travelling around, unlocking Hitching Posts, and meeting contacts,” Amato said. “Challenges are instanced and accessed via these contacts, and doing so will place you into a combat location or special world state.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These combat encounters reuse mission locations, so once you’ve played the corresponding story chapter and unlocked a Challenge in Free Ride, you’ll get to re-experience areas in new ways. Races happen out in the world and we’ve placed them along less-traveled paths, so it should be fun seeing parts of the map you may have previously passed by.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Of course, there may be new places to explore too, but that’s something you’ll have to discover for yourself…”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/54922236404-e0d5a22d89-h-1763575721023.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Cinema Siciliano visual treatment makes Mafia feel like 'a genuine piece of classic Italian cinema.'</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, there’s the Cinema Siciliano visual treatment, which Amato said makes Mafia: The Old Country feel like playing “a genuine piece of classic Italian cinema.” “The visual treatment is stunning and it feels like you’re experiencing a black-and-white movie shot on an old-school sound stage, while the vintage-sounding audio convincingly brings the whole thing together,” Amato explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the new items earned by playing Free Ride are usable in the main story campaign. All the new elements are present from the start, so new players will have them as options going through the game for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The addition of first-person driving is a first for the Mafia franchise. And the Classic difficulty makes the game harder.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/54921115492-937ba8fbf2-h-1763575661878.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mafia: The Old Country is getting first-person driving.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, Strauss Zelnick, boss of 2K parent company Take-Two, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-confident-in-mafia-franchise-after-the-old-country-performs-well-ahead-of-expectations">teased a bright future for the Mafia franchise after <u>Mafia: The Old Country</u> “performed well ahead of expectations.”</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Definitely,” Zelnick said when asked if The Old Country performed well enough to instill confidence to continue the franchise. “We’re really excited about Mafia, and I think that’s a great question because it is sort of a reset for the franchise. We don’t have anything to announce — that comes from the label — but it definitely performed well ahead of expectations."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like the decision to sell Mafia: The Old Country at a cheaper than expected $49.99 price point paid off, then. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-the-move-to-80-video-games-kicks-in-gamers-point-to-mafia-the-old-country-and-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-hope-the-50-trend-succeeds"><u>Fans praised The Old Country's $50 price tag when it was confirmed</u></a>, and publisher 2K and developer Hangar 13 managed expectations by stressing pre-launch that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-compare-mafia-the-old-country-to-gta-6-dev-says-theyre-not-as-similar-as-youd-think"><u>it was absolutely </u><u><em>not</em></u><u> a Grand Theft Auto-style open-world game, but a linear, narrative-driven game</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two stopped short of providing exact sales figures but said the early 1900s Sicily-set Mafia “quickly surpassed our internal expectations and affirmed our belief that consumer demand remains strong for premium, narrative-driven experiences that over-index on value.” Although it’s unclear when or how another Mafia game could materialize in the future, more new content and updates for The Old Country are confirmed to be in the works.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mafia: The Old Country – Meet Your New Family</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mafia: The Old Country launched in August as a prequel for the crime drama video game franchise that got its start with the original Mafia in 2002. The series saw semi-regular releases up until the launch of the divisive Mafia 3 in 2016, with only a group of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-definitive-edition"><u>well-received definitive edition remasters</u></a> arriving to break up the wait for more in 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-review"><u>Mafia: The Old Country review</u></a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Mafia: The Old Country is a conventional but effective return to the linear and tightly story-driven format of the original Mafia and Mafia II, and it boasts a wonderful eye and ear for detail."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
