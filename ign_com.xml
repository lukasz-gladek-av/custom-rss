            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-the-most-its-fine-game-weve-played-in-a-while<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">ARC Raiders is blisteringly, aggressively archetypical, the extraction-est extraction shooter that ever extracted. It’s one of the least surprising games I’ve ever played, holding so much in common with its inspirations that they’re almost comically indistinguishable. For preview purposes, this is a very good thing:  If you enjoy other games about scavenging goods while avoiding PvE foes and robbing PvP humans, you’re probably going to like ARC Raiders. If you don’t, then there’s likely nothing new here to tempt you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a game so unabashedly tied to its progenitors that the hero’s default melee weapon is a pickaxe, the same weapon Fortnite metaverse heroes dropping off the Battle Bus lug into combat. That’s a cute enough homage, but it's only the tip of the iceberg for the ways ARC Raiders will be instantly comprehensible to those who play Battle Royale, tree-punching survival games, or extraction. There’s very little that feels truly original, but the components bolted together from other successful live service games click together predictably and produce a satisfying result. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">ARC Raiders - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The goal each round is simple: go to the surface and then get back underground alive with better loot than you started with. Two forces stand in the way of that goal. The first are the ARC, AI-controlled battle robots that wander the map searching for any sign of organic life. The ARC are no trifling threat. Even the smallest bots can prove surprisingly dangerous, especially in groups. The little spider-like scurriers are downright upsetting for an arachnophobe like me, and the large crawlers do not mess around. ARC wander the map listening for the sounds of search or battle and swarm any humans they find. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ARC are especially dangerous in numbers, and there are plenty of subtle little traps set where clusters of different ARC with complementary abilities are placed near one another, sometimes hidden in indoor areas where one can literally trip into them. I met my fate more than once when I got overconfident around ARC. One crawling monstrosity literally spun into the air with its legs like some cyclops spider helicopter. Take down an ARC, though, and the rewards can be worth your trouble. They generally contain ammo and weapon components. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Arc Raiders - Screenshots and GIFs</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The second and more deadly threat are your fellow raiders. If you choose to play ARC Raiders, you’d best enjoy watching your back, because to quote Casablanca, “this place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere.” It’s often more efficient to fall upon a fully-loaded player who isn’t paying attention than to risk a half hour of bracing open doors in a nearby warehouse, or to lurk near an extraction point and cut down somebody when they’re about to escape. Of course, every other raider is likely looking to do the same to you. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you choose to play ARC Raiders, you’d best enjoy watching your back, because to quote Casablanca, “this place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is competent enough to be satisfying. Your third-person avatar moves and controls like most other third-person avatars in modern shooters, with no real irregularities or surprises in the controls. Bullets mostly go where you want them to, depending on the capabilities of your chosen weapon, and melee attack power is substantial. Firearms feel right: SMGs are springy and difficult to control, assault rifles steady and heavy, sniper rifles punch like artillery. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing in teams of three adds a bit of depth to the battle, as you and your companions can search and cover for each other much more systematically than is possible with a single raider. Firefights between teams develop a sense of strategy, as coordinating squads deploy flanking tactics and ambushes against groups of foes. Whether calling out directions, overhearing sounds, covering all windows in a room, your three-person squad will find plenty of tension waiting in most buildings. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cleverly-designed maps draw the characters in. The most lucrative resource hubs are clearly marked, and players flock to the richest areas looking for loot, or hover between the treasures and the extraction areas, waiting to dispossess the luckiest foragers of their well-won gains. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The environments are passable, with the usual collection of rusty warehouses, abandoned apartment buildings, and overgrown vacant lots you’ll find in a lot of post-apocalyptic shooters. Everything is serviceable, but it all kinda feels like they gave Fortnite a coat of Day Z grime and moved on. It’s a boring enough world that it certainly took me out of any chance of getting into the lore. But I don’t really think lore is the big draw here anyway. ARC Raiders is meat loaf without much plate presentation, but the meat loaf is tasty if a little cold. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>ARC Raiders is meat loaf without much plate presentation, but the meat loaf is tasty if a little cold. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Every drawer and cabinet is a potential source of wealth: crafting components, ammunition, shields, healing items, and weapons. Ammunition is properly segmented enough to keep you hungry as you scavenge and construct guns. Light, medium, heavy, and shotgun ammo variants are available early on to locate in the overworld, craft in your lair, or purchase underground. Materials have the usual, predictable levels of rarity corresponding to color, with certain colors granting the ability to develop more useful or rare items. A single special pocket in your inventory allows you to keep one special discovered item safe even in the event of your death, so that you can haul your rarest finds home even when you die.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some containers take time to open and generate quite a bit of noise when manipulated, which is a delightful tension-raising mechanic that I really appreciated. Opening one of these was especially harrowing when playing solo... you can really feel the vulnerability with your camera locked forward, not knowing what passing robot or player might discover you as you make an ugly racket jimmying a door. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You spend your time between rounds underground, where you convert your ill-gotten gains into an ever-escalating series of crafting tables allowing for the creation of ever-more-elaborate gear. You can also choose to straight liquidate materials and finds for cash, and purchase fully-created items at in-game stores. There’s also some part of crafting that involves a live rooster. I never figured that out. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you explore the world above, you gain experience which opens up access to a series of Skill Trees. Selecting various branches can help you optimize your avatar to your playstyle, increasing combat ability, mobility, or stealth. The different abilities are clearly labeled, and most are useful enough that every step feels like real progress. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Character design with default options is pretty rough, but a number of better textures and outfits open up when you apply premium currency. I deliberately made my guy look as bleak and sad as possible using only default options, but my multiplayer partner had this whole ZZ Top Man With No Name vibe going on... I was envious. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">ARC Raiders previews pretty well, perhaps because its design conservatism makes it so instantly familiar. There’s absolutely nothing here to challenge what came before, but sometimes, that’s okay. Overall, the ARC Raiders loop seems pretty well tuned to satisfy: make it to the surface to loot and kill, bring your goods and experience back underground to improve your abilities, head back up stronger to find stronger gear, and repeat. There are worse ways to spend an afternoon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jared Petty is a former IGN editor who likes writing about how wonderful and silly video games are.

The classic gameplay style of many RPGs has contended with more action-oriented systems for some time, and now Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is restarting discussion over the direction of some genre titans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 went live last week and is, by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">both IGN's</a> and <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/18026/clair-obscur-expedition-33" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many other accounts</a>, an excellent RPG. It is unabashedly clear about its inspirations. There's a turn order, Pictos to equip and master, zoned-out "dungeons" to crawl, and even an overworld map.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/17041-clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-celebrating-turn-based-games-classic-rpg-influences-in-making-something-new" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPGsite</a>, producer Francois Meurisse said Clair Obscur was conceived as a turn-based game from the start, and pointed to Final Fantasy VIII, IX, and X in particular. Of course, there's also Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which is where Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's turn-based action takes after both FromSoftware's games and the likes of Mario &amp; Luigi: using quick-time events on attacks, and parrying / dodging on defense.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is a turn-based game that feels like a traditional turn-based game when you're inputting attacks and crafting your strategy each turn, then like a more action-oriented game when you're doing damage or defending against it. It's a fascinating system that has, predictably, stirred up discourse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Namely, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/04/expedition-33s-sublime-success-sparks-chatter-about-final-fantasys-future" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media users have taken the opportunity</a> to point out Clair Obscur's success as a counter-argument to long-held grudges over positions on turn-based games; namely, from the Final Fantasy series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An easy example: Naoki Yoshida, while on the media tour for Final Fantasy XVI, talked about why Final Fantasy and RPGs have taken on more action-based mechanics over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I’m from a generation that grew up with command and turn-based RPGs," Yoshida told Famitsu (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/final-fantasy-16-ditched-turn-based-combat-to-appeal-to-younger-generations-producer-says/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a>). “I think I understand how interesting and immersive it can be. On the other hand, for the past decade or so, I’ve seen quite a number of opinions saying 'I don’t understand the attraction of selecting commands in video games.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This opinion is only increasing, particularly with younger audiences who do not typically play RPGs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This thinking is reflected in the series, as Final Fantasy XV, XVI, and the VII remake series have all opted for more action-driven systems. Each has garnered their own share of fans and detractors.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And comments about turn-based games, and whether they connect with players, often come up in those moments. It's easy to see how stalwarts might read Yoshida's comments and hold a grudge, and now feel vindicated by Clair Obscur's status as the hottest game on the block. Here is a turn-based RPG, inspired by the greats, wearing its inspirations on its sleeve, and thriving.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Any truth is, as always, a little more nuanced than just that. It's certainly a little more nuanced than just, "Final Fantasy should do this."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For one, Square Enix might have seen its Final Fantasy series head in a more action-oriented direction, but it certainly hasn't dumped turn-based games wholesale. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/octopath-traveler-ii">Octopath Traveler 2</a> was, in this writer's opinion, one of the better role-playing games in the last few years, and the publisher has continued to roll out more turn-based RPGs, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/saga-emerald-beyond">SaGa Emerald Beyond</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">upcoming Bravely Default remaster</a> for Switch 2. While Final Fantasy may not be as turn-based as its SNES or PlayStation 1 days, it's not like Square has done away with the format.</p><div id="best-mainline-final-fantasy-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3><h3>Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And if the question is whether Final Fantasy should imitate Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, or whether this is "Final Fantasy if it was good" or not, well, <a href="https://x.com/GenePark/status/1915893483061055725" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I'd have to agree with everyone</a> replying with a resolute "nope." Final Fantasy has its own aesthetic drives and iconography that a simple "replace X with Y" can't really account for. While some comparisons between Clair Obscur and Final Fantasy are obvious, it's also easy to note the differences. Reducing Clair Obscur down to "Final France-tasy" is fun wordplay, but it does a disservice to both what's made Final Fantasy an enduring series, and what Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has done to elevate itself above mere imitation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is, funny enough, not the first time we've done this. Those with some tingling soreness in their lower backs <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/i2v43i/lost_odyssey_was_the_true_final_fantasy_successor/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">might recall discussions about Lost Odyssey</a> and whether it was the "true" successor to Final Fantasy, over the series' direction going into Final Fantasy XIII. Go back even further, and you can probably dig up conversations about whether Final Fantasy VII is truly better than Final Fantasy VI or not. As long as there have been two Final Fantasy fans on the internet, there have been arguments about Final Fantasy on the internet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">None of this is accounting for sales either, which were a driver for Yoshida's aforementioned comments to Famitsu on Final Fantasy XVI's direction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As I said, I believe I know the fun of command system RPGs, and I want to continue developing them, but I thought about the expected sales of Final Fantasy XVI and the impact that we have to deliver," said Yoshida. The Final Fantasy XVI producer did not even rule out the possibility that the next Final Fantasy could use a command system; just that, at the time of the studio making it, Final Fantasy XVI was going to be the game it became.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's an interesting point to watch, as time goes on. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has certainly been a breakout success for Sandfall Interactive and Kepler, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hit-rpg-clair-obscur-expedition-33-tops-1-million-sales-in-just-3-days">garnering 1 million sales over three days</a>. It's a strong start, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-16-and-7-rebirth-profits-did-not-meet-our-expectations">Square Enix's expectations for Final Fantasy are usually a bit higher</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most tired part, still worth noting, is the idea that turn-based games might struggle to see success. We have seen breakout hits in the space; notably, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>. While it's easy to point at the tip of the iceberg to make a point, it is worth noting that we've seen these RPGs — which each take after classic role-playing elements in their own way — have garnered both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2023-winners-the-full-list">acclaim</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-has-already-sold-1-million-copies-and-its-only-been-out-a-day">financial success</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, ultimately, Clair Obscur's success means a lot for the team behind it. It's an encouraging project that, even as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we get into discussions on its team size</a> compared to what you expect, feels like a return of the scoped, scaled, mid-budget RPG alongside the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/visions-of-mana">Visions of Mana</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ruined-kings-a-league-of-legends-story">Ruined King</a>. Whether its momentum carries it on higher, to the heights of something like a Baldur's Gate 3 or Disco Elysium, is yet to be seen, but you can't ask for a better start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for whether it signals some radical shift is necessary for Final Fantasy, I'm less confident. While Square Enix has said recent entries like Final Fantasy XVI and FF7 Rebirth's profits <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-16-and-7-rebirth-profits-did-not-meet-our-expectations">did not meet expectations</a>, that feels like a struggle shaped as much by broad shifts in the gaming landscape, as the cost of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/major-publishers-report-aaa-franchises-can-cost-over-a-billion-to-make">making major entries in huge franchises has not been a cheap endeavor</a>. They're taking a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-victim-long-development-time-playstation">long time to make</a>, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If anything, the lesson to take away is to be unapologetically authentic. Projects that imitate can struggle to break out from the shadows. It's why I stressed earlier that for all the ways Clair Obscur wears its inspirations on its sleeve, it's not wholly defined by its predecessors; its clever combat systems, incredible soundtrack, thoughtful world-building and scene direction all come from within, from the studio's drives. To put it better, here's Larian CEO Swen Vincke, recently discussing the "single-player games are dead" discourse that also pops up quite often:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think we've proven with [Baldur's Gate 3] that you can put in a pretty high budget and expect pretty high results," Vincke told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9P2HPF9ss" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameSpot</a>. As Vincke has stated several times over, you just have to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/boss-of-baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-says-single-player-games-arent-dead-they-just-have-to-be-good">make a good game</a>, one that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-reveals-what-he-wanted-to-say-at-the-game-awards-2023">your creative team is excited to make</a>. That seems like a constructive way forward for everyone, and one that doesn't feel like reheating the leftovers of old internet discourse all over again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
