Can you do that?’ Aki translated this into Japanese for Mr. Kitaue, and Kitaue just looked at them and told them plainly, ‘No.' We did still get to enjoy the Matrix Japanese premiere and afterparty, though."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, in a message posted to social media in English, Kojima said that while he and The Wachowskis were "mutual fans and exchanged emails," he didn't know they were hoping he'd take on a game adaptation of the movie, and "there could've been a way to make it work" despite his commitment to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-2-son-of-liberty"><u>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I was surprised to see on social media that the Wachowski sisters had “offered me a Matrix game project!” back in 1999.

In the morning, we had a Famitsu interview in Shinjuku — that time, Geof Darrow joined us for the talk session. In the afternoon, they were invited to the headquarters of Konami's CS Division. Back then, I was vice-president of KCE Japan, a wholly-owned subsidiary. When I arrived at the headquarters, their meeting with Mr. Kitaue, the head of the CS Division, had just ended. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I joined them afterward, and we chatted for about an hour without an interpreter (Aki wasn’t even there)," he added. "I think John Gaeta, the visual effects supervisor, was also present. That evening, I attended the premiere screening and party, where I also met Joel Silver. Even then, there was no mention of an offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At that time, I was already extremely busy with [Metal Gear Solid 2] and probably couldn’t have accepted the offer right away.
