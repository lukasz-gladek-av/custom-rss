The beta will include two new characters, one with telekinesis (Kae) and the other with a jetpack (Adrian). Additionally, the beta will add three new explorable points of interest, new daily missions, a revamped mission system, and other improvements.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Wildgate was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/wildgate-official-announcement-trailer">first announced back in March</a>.

All the characters and the aesthetics of the world they inhabit are heavily steeped in classic Japanese art, and among the cast is what appears to be, delightfully, a giant shiba and a large talking koi.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Summer Game Fest right here</a>, and stick with us for everything coming this weekend <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-live-2025-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect">from IGN Live</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
