Secondly, in-game purchases will be delisted on February 25, 2026, and finally, support will end completely in August 2026. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, HoYo has given a decent notice period, so you'll still be able to play Genshin Impact on PS4 right up until August 4, 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5 players are not to worry — the change shouldn't affect you at all, and Travelers will still be able to "enjoy the latest content updates."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These adjustments apply only to Genshin Impact on PS4," the publisher reiterated. "We recommend that Travelers currently playing on PS4 transition to PS5 or other supported platforms to continue enjoying the game. Your game progress will not be affected. If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please feel free to contact Genshin Impact Customer Service."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The announcement has garnered a lot of attention in the post's <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408849" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>comment section</u></a>, with hundreds of players sharing their thoughts. Some are confused why the game has to be discontinued on PS4 at all, given that the game is accessible on mobile devices, while others accept that PS4's decade-old architecture had an inevitable end date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While a PS5 may still be out of reach, don't forget that Genshin supports crossplay across all platforms, including mobile — <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/m/en/news/detail/103969" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>here's now to cross-save between your accounts</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the open-world action RPG Genshin Impact, you are a traveler drifted from another world who has awoken in a new land. You will explore this wondrous world freely, make friends along the way, and look for "The Seven" — Archons of the seven elements. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We thought it was 'amazing' when it released back in 2020, awarding it 9/10 in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/genshin-impact-review"><u>IGN Genshin Impact review</u></a>, writing: "Genshin Impact is an amazing open-world adventure that draws heavily on both its Breath of the Wild and anime inspirations to create something truly special. Even if the gacha model introduces some undesirable level grinding deeper in, the excellent combat, addictive exploration, and beautiful world make this one of the most exciting games I've played all year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
