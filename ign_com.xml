            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Get ready for the non-VR version of the "next evolution of Alien combat" this September.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN can exclusively reveal a brand-new gameplay trailer for Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One: Evolved Edition, the previously VR-exclusive shooter that is set to be released on PS5 and PC on September 30, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new footage, which you can see below and is filled with blood and snow, shows plenty of Xenomorphs stalking the main character - ex-Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks - and the terrifying and exhilarating action that will follow, complete with Pulse Rifles, Motion Trackers, jump scares, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the story, for those who didn't play Alien: Rogue Incursion when it first launched on PlayStation VR2 and PCVR via Steam in December 2024 (And on Meta Quest in February), it is set on the planet Purdan (LV-354) in Gemini Exoplanet Solutions' Castor's Cradle research facility that is now "hauntingly desolate." Oh, and it's set between the events of Alien and Aliens and Zula will be traveling with a Synthetic companion named Davis 01.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new version features everything included in the original plus "elevated visuals, immersive environments, and deadlier Xenomorphs." It also runs at 60 FPS and promises to be the "next evolution of Alien combat."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alien-rogue-incursion-review">review of the original Alien: Rogue Incursion,</a> we said it is "a faithful and entertaining stab at bringing Alien to virtual reality. The excellent story, spot-on Alien environments, and creepy Xenomorphs keep the horrifying times going throughout its eight-hour duration, even when repetitive combat, predictable AI, and the odd bug here and there make it clear this is the first attempt that it is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But while there’s plenty of room for this budding series to grow, I can already happily recommend Rogue Incursion as a strong proof of concept to Alien fans and newcomers alike – one that’s left me eagerly awaiting Part Two."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Part Two, we don't know much besides that it is currently in development and that it "continues Zula's story, pitting her against deadlier enemies and more difficult challenges."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from SDCC, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-coming-to-ign-san-diego-comic-con-2025-live-show">all the details of our live-show</a> that will feature Project Hail Mary, King of the Hill, Peacemaker, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“Why would you guys bring that up?"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Cast your mind back to 2023. At the time, MCU fans didn’t know who exactly would go on to play The Sentry in Thunderbolts*, but the rumor mill pointed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/invincible">Invincible</a> star Steven Yeun. So when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-walking-dead-star-steven-yeuns-top-secret-mcu-role-revealed">Invincible creator Robert Kirkman let slip that Yeun would be playing Robert Reynolds</a>, aka The Sentry, in Thunderbolts*, Marvel fans went wild.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s that original quote from Kirkman two years ago:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, he [Yeun] called me, he went in for a costume fitting. I hope I’m not... I don’t think this is a spoiler or anything that will get anybody in trouble. I don’t know, maybe. We’ll see. I don’t care. I don’t work for Marvel. What are they going to do to me?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, he called me and he said, 'I just came back from a costume fitting for The Sentry. I guess I only do superheroes that are yellow and blue.' He said he was at the costume fitting and was like, 'Aww, crap. I forgot Invincible was yellow and blue.'"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward two years, with Thunderbolts* out the door, and we know The Sentry eventually went to Lewis Pullman after Yeun himself dropped out. But at the time, Yeun as The Sentry felt like a sure thing. After all, Kirkman had confirmed it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, it seemed, caused Kirkman all sorts of trouble. In an interview with IGN at San Diego Comic-Con 2025 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robert-kirkman-teases-massive-roster-of-playable-characters-for-invincible-vs-thats-a-spoiler-i-might-get-in-trouble-for-that-sdcc-2025">to promote fighting game Invincible VS</a>, we asked Kirkman <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aang-avatar-movie-adds-invincibles-steven-yeun-to-its-cast">who Yeun will play in the upcoming animated The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender movie</a>, given how much he seemingly knows about the actor's schedule.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don't want to lose any more sleep spoiling Steven Yeun news!” Kirkman said. “I cannot tell you how much that Thunderbolts thing affected me.” Then, Kirkman joked: “Why would you guys bring that up? I'm so angry.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Avatar: The Last Airbender Episodes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirkman wenton to reveal that he actually <em>does</em> know who Yeun plays in The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender, but this time stopped short of spilling the beans - perhaps with his Thunderbolts / Marvel run-in in mind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The best part is he told me who he's playing in The Last Airbender and I was like, ‘I wish I didn't know. I wish I didn't know.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirkman continued the joke, saying Steven Yeun is set to play Abraham Lincoln in the unconfirmed hit TV show based on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skinbreaker-skybound-exclusive-preview-robert-kirkman-david-finch">Skinbreaker</a>, his new comic book series he’s working on with artist David Finch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At Comic-Con this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-season-4s-dinosaurus-has-a-voice-actor-robert-kirkman-says-7-9-seasons-needed-to-do-the-complete-comic-arc-jokes-season-5-will-be-out-in-2032-sdcc-2025">Kirkman announced Invincible Season 4's Dinosaurus voice actor</a>, revealed how many seasons the show will need to complete the story of the comics, and joked Season 5 will be out in 2032.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Michael Buckner/Variety via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
