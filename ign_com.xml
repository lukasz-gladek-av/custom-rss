Better yet, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6D8BR?object_uuid=6034817e-26e6-4737-83e4-709a58b40a4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>a bundle of all four is discounted at Amazon right now</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fallout Commander Decks: Under $40 Each With This Bundle Deal</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has all four decks for $144.99, a reduction of 11% on the $162.99 list price. That might not sound like a huge amount, but consider what that value represents when the Mutant Menace deck is selling for $70 and upwards on its own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the decks, the good news is that they’re all pretty great. Mutant Menace is one of the best, powering up its spooky Mothman Commander with counters as you deal radiation to everyone else at the table, while Hail Caesar is all about being aggressive and sacrificing cards to power up Caesar himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Science! offers something a little different since it leans into energy counters and powering up the board with artifacts, while Scrappy Survivors is definitely popular since it’s helmed by the adorable Dogmeat and has the series’ four-legged star rummaging through your graveyard for equipment and tokens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a reminder, each of these decks comes with a Collector Booster Sample Pack, too. They contain two cards each, but it’s better than getting irradiated, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you already have any of these, Amazon has discounts on a couple of them, too. At the time of writing, you can pick up <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6D8Bk?object_uuid=6034817e-26e6-4737-83e4-709a58b40a4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Scrappy Survivors for $44.99</u></a>, a discount of 25%, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxRpb?object_uuid=6034817e-26e6-4737-83e4-709a58b40a4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Hail Caesar undercuts it by literal cents</u></a>: It’s $44.95. Finally, Amazon isn’t showing it as discounted, but <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOgy2B?object_uuid=6034817e-26e6-4737-83e4-709a58b40a4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>$40 is a decent price for Science</u></a>!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios have previewed some of the gameplay tweaks and balance changes coming with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> day one patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Information about the first patch for this week’s long-awaited back-to-basics Battlefield game was outlined in a post on <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-play-your-way" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>its official website</u></a> today. It comes with a breakdown from the team explaining how their pre-release Battlefield Labs and beta tests helped them prepare for launch, with the first Battlefield 6 patch set to provide an even more stable foundation.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who played the Battlefield 6 open beta in August will notice several fundamental changes to how the DICE, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and Motive-developed game feels after its day one patch is downloaded. Today’s first look at the Battlefield 6 launch update is only a taste of what's to come, with full patch notes for the more than 200 changes set to arrive later this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Topping the list are tweaks the BF Studios team says will make movement feel more responsive, including fixes for “several movement issues” and changes to pacing. Weapon attachments should also display correctly across the Battlefield 6 experience, with the day one patch also promising rebalanced automatic weapons that make long-range gunplay more rewarding for tap firing and burst control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beta players will also be happy to hear Rush and Breakthrough have been reworked to improve balance between both the attacking and defending teams. Gadgets in Battlefield 6 will also be changed for the day one patch. The MBT-LAW, for example, is now set as the default Engineer launcher, while the MAS 148 now behaves more realistically, and Deploy Beacons have been updated to limit one spawn per player.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Battlefield 6 day one patch also promises updated UI and HUD elements, cleaner audio, improved network stability, and more, today’s post also comes with an update on one of the most hotly contested topics in the community: Open vs. Closed Weapons. Closed locks guns to specific classes, while Open allows each class to utilize a variety of different weapon types. Despite waves of fans hoping to see the BF Studios team lean on Closed classes for Battlefield 6, the team insisted in today’s post that Open classes were preferred by “the vast majority of players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Lastly, another key insight from the Open Beta was that the vast majority of players, after trying both playlist types, chose to stick with Open Weapons,” BF Studios says. “This reinforces our belief that Open Weapons is the right path forward for Battlefield 6. At the same time, we recognize that some players prefer the Closed Weapons experience. To support them, official Closed Weapons playlists will be available at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Additionally, Closed Weapons mutators will remain part of the Portal toolset, so players can create and share their own custom experiences.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 has a release date of October 10 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. Check out the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-global-release-times-confirmed"><u>Battlefield 6 global release times</u></a> if you want to know when you'll be able to play in your timezone. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-roadmap-revealed-heres-what-to-expect">Season 1</a>, meanwhile, kicks off October 28 and will deliver additional maps, guns, vehicles, and more, with additional updates planned for November 18 and December 9.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on our time with the Battlefield 6 beta, we’ve got a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/Battlefield_6_Beta_Beginner%27s_Guide_and_Tips">BF6 Beginner’s Guide and Tips</a>, plus the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/Best_BF6_Loadouts">best Battlefield 6 Loadouts</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/BF6_Range_Finder_Explained">how to use the Range Finder</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/How_to_Deploy_Bipod">deploy the Bipod</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/How_to_Turn_Off_Haptic_Feedback">how to turn off Haptic Feedback in Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, you can see everything we know about the Battlefield 6 day one patch below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield 6 Day One Patch Notes Preview:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The following gameplay updates will be included in our launch day patch, with over 200 changes focused on bug fixes, balance improvements, and polish for release.
