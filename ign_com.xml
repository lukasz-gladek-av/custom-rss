            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">10 hours in, this finely-tuned extraction shooter is hard to put down.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I thought I was only going to play five or six hours of ARC Raiders on launch day before sitting down to write this initial review in progress, but after just a handful of matches, I suddenly couldn’t pull myself away – and before I realized it, I’d been playing for 10 hours. This is without question the most hooked I’ve found myself on an extraction shooter (and I’ve played a lot of them), with clean and tense gunplay, a progression system that’s been incredibly satisfying so far, and a loot game that has me sweating over what to put in my backpack and what to leave behind. I’ve still got loads more to do and see before I can draw any final conclusions, but what I <em>have </em>played has made an incredibly good first impression.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ARC Raiders follows the usual extraction shooter formula of dropping you into a zone to take down NPC enemies and scramble for loot, all while looking over your shoulder for rival crews who would love nothing more than to crack you open like a meat pinata and take everything you’ve collected. From what I’ve seen so far, ARC Raiders hasn’t done much to iterate on those fundamentals, but it does absolutely nail them, and that’s harder to do than it might sound – for example, a big budget attempt like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-review">Battlefield 2042</a>’s Hazard Zone mostly fell flat, and the alpha for Bungie's Marathon landed with such a thud <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-delayed-as-bungie-promises-to-reveal-new-release-date-this-fall">it was delayed indefinitely</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the main ways it succeeds is in its stressful gunplay, where weapons only have a few rounds in each magazine, take a good deal of time to reload, and the robotic NPCs are either much faster than you or can rain down missiles to take you out in a single blast. This means I’m usually feeling like a rodent sneaking around to scavenge food and supplies from the world before slinking back to base – but when combat does break out, it’s charged with delightful anxiety thanks to the high-risk, high-reward situation of knowing you’re either about to lose everything you’ve fought for or grab some awesome gear off the corpses of those you’ve bested. This includes both AI-controlled and human players, as both can be found and fought out in the world, though it’s best to avoid either of them unless you know you’ve brought the gear and skills required for a fight. That’s because firing a shot has a good chance of drawing all robot enemies and loot-hungry players to your position, taking advantage of your vulnerability to do as much damage as possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All four of the maps I’ve seen so far have very cool and distinct vibes to them, from the ruined husk of a waterlogged dam to a city buried in red sand. It’s a good thing that they’re so great to look at, too, because you’ll spend a whole lot of time trekking back and forth across them in search of loot. I still feel like I haven’t seen most of the nooks and crannies of these areas, despite having played on them for dozens of matches already, but they are starting to feel a little familiar to me. Here’s hoping they’ve still got secrets to uncover that expand the amount of time I’m willing to spend on each.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Extraction Shooters</h3><p>For those who like risking it all on loot that's well worth it, these are your best bets.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As I work toward exploring every last zone, one thing I’m still looking for is an enemy combatant I haven’t faced yet (aside from the massive tanks, which I’m just steering clear of at this early stage). Most of my NPC combat encounters have been against the small roly poly bots and flying drones that are fairly easy to destroy, with my fellow players being the only proper challenge so far. I’m looking forward to the point where I’m powerful enough to actually engage with some of the chonkier enemies more seriously, but it still would have been nice to have a wider variety of low level AI combatants to shake up the early game a bit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, even as maps and enemies have begun to feel familiar, that hasn’t dampened my desire to play just because of how good the loot and progressions systems are. Every run, win or lose, has me excited to return to the cozy sanctuary of Speranza, where I can chat with vendors, turn in and accept new quests, upgrade my facilities that allow me to craft items and gain access to new upgrades, customize my character’s appearance, and spend skill points that make me slightly better at things like keeping quiet while rifling through loot during matches. There’s so much to do and unlock that I truly feel I’ve only scratched the surface in this regard, and that’s kept me glued to my controller and eager to dive into new matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, there’s still lots to do and robots to slay, so I’ll be headed back out to the wastes for more just as soon as I’m finished typing. You can expect a full, scored review early next week!</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Three weeks ago on this day, I featured <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-october-10">Mega Evolution in my weekly Crashers and Climbers article</a>, which focused on the set doing the typical evening out after the drop of a new set. Some cards were going up, some were going down, business as usual. Damn sneaker heads!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to today, after a seemingly massive print run, everything is crashing. Literally every card you can pick out of this set is seeing new lows. For me, this is a market correction after a year of inflated prices both on the sealed and single card markets for a variety of factors I've discussed before.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Mega Evolution: All Crashers And Zero Climbs</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst I don't think we're seeing the bubble burst on the market just yet, we're seeing a massive market correction that could see a decline in scalped product and more availability across the board. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you can't tell by now, I won't be including a "Climbers" section today, but I'll be diving into just how much values have crashed in the last three weeks and bag my readers a few bargains in the process. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the top cards from Mega Evolution at a glance, and we're seeing between 8% and 33% drops in just three weeks. Full disclosure, the "Original Prices" on these cards are what I recorded on 10th October, just so we're on the same page.</p><p id="bulbasaur-133132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Bulbasaur - 133/132">Bulbasaur - 133/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229411"><div id="229411" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bulbasaur - 133/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like N's Reshiram Illustration Rare in Journey Together, this Bulbasaur Illustration Rare has a Mega Evolution Stamped version that's packed into every Enhanced Booster Box. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it's a bit of a tough one to say which one is rarer, although I'd put my Pokédollars on the stamped version getting rarer over time. Needless to say it's a gorgeous card either way that's dropped by 23% from October 10.</p></div><p id="bulbasaur-133132-mega-evolution"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Bulbasaur - 133/132 (Mega Evolution ">Bulbasaur - 133/132 (Mega Evolution Stamp)</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229410"><div id="229410" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bulbasaur - 133/132 (Mega Evolution Stamp)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a similar scenario with the Mega Evolution Stamp variant of Bulby, but the floor on this card seems to be a little higher than the standard IR. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It still dropped by 23%, but we're seein it retain a couple of dollars more in value. When you're right, you're right.</p></div><p id="mega-kangaskhan-ex-182132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Kangaskhan ex - 182/132">Mega Kangaskhan ex - 182/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229406"><div id="229406" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Kangaskhan ex - 182/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Khankaskhan ex SIR has only had an 8% drop, but it's a drop none-the-less. This card hardly broke expectations on the market, securing a low-end SIR level of value out the gate. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So whilst we're not seeing dramatic crashes here, we've got a solid value on this card that should only rise over time.</p></div><p id="mega-absol-ex-180132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Absol ex - 180/132">Mega Absol ex - 180/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229992"><div id="229992" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Absol ex - 180/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Absol ex SIR is an absolute banger, and in my opinion one of the best from this set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some reason this card didn't go mad when Mega Evolution came out, but it's still had a drop of 9% to a respectable $96.01 at the moment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is such an underated card, and I'd highly reccomend snapping it up whilst values are down.</p></div><p id="alakazam-003-staff"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Alakazam - 003 (Staff)">Alakazam - 003 (Staff)</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229991"><div id="229991" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alakazam - 003 (Staff)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Staff cards are always ridiculous value-wise due to the small distribution base and not being available in booster packs. A handfull are given out at Pokémon TCG events such as tournaments, and this one has actually dropped by 16%. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Secondary market prices always go off what people are willing to pay, but it's still a coin flip situation. If you collect staff cards, It might be worth picking up whilst it's nearly $30 less than October 10.</p></div><p id="mega-latias-ex-181132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Latias ex - 181/132">Mega Latias ex - 181/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229404"><div id="229404" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Latias ex - 181/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At over $20 cheaper and a 13% price crash, I'd bit for Mega Latias ex SIR for under $150. It's a gorgeous card and has ridiculously expresive artwork. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't see this card loosing a lot more value, so i'd recommend picking this bad boy up before it shoots back up.</p></div><p id="mega-venusaur-ex-177132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Venusaur ex - 177/132">Mega Venusaur ex - 177/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229405"><div id="229405" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Venusaur ex - 177/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Venusaur is the best generation one starter and i'll live on that hill, because I can't die with Venusaur at my side. Correct opinions aside, this card is getting more and more affordable has time goes on, In just three weeks this card has dropped by over $30, or 20%, to $174.80. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally I think this card can settle to $150, but that's just a gut feeling. Considering how playable it is with the help of Meganium, this feels like a good price.</p></div><p id="mega-gardevoir-ex-178132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Gardevoir ex - 178/132">Mega Gardevoir ex - 178/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229403"><div id="229403" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Gardevoir ex - 178/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is arguably the chase card of the set for those who don't like Gold Hyper Rares, just look at it. Not only is Gardevoir a fan favorite (Let's forget about that life-sized weeb plush), but its a work of art. This has crashed massively by over $80, to a much more respectable $234.99, and i'd put a solid bet on this card climbing right back up in no time. </p></div><p id="mega-lucario-ex-179132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Lucario ex - 179/132">Mega Lucario ex - 179/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229409"><div id="229409" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Lucario ex - 179/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is my favorite card of the set, featuring an expresive sky-high battle over Luminoise City between Mega Lucario and Mega Venusaur. For me it's a continuation of the Charizard V Alt Art from the Sword and Shield era featuring Venusaur. Top tier artwork and two fan favorite Pokémon and it's 20% down on Oct. 10, it's a great time to buy this card.</p></div><p id="mega-gardevoir-ex-187132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Gardevoir ex - 187/132">Mega Gardevoir ex - 187/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229407"><div id="229407" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Gardevoir ex - 187/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This gold rare has had one of the biggest drops i've seen for a while. This was going for $600 on Oct. 10, and it's dropped by a massive 33% to $399, which I think is about the right value for it now. If history teaches us anything, Gold Rares go down not up. But the unique embossed patterns and rainbow holo effect Mega Evolution Gold Rares have seems to be turning more heads. Personally it's not for me, but it's a tied top chase card with Mega Lucario ex Gold Rare.</p></div><p id="mega-lucario-ex-188132"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Lucario ex - 188/132">Mega Lucario ex - 188/132</h2></p><div catalogid="4ad01f69-e15b-44a7-8e9e-29d2447c0865" id="229402"><div id="229402" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Lucario ex - 188/132</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you think $530 is eye-watering, this card was a massive $630 three weeks ago, so it's deffinately moving in the right direction. One thing i've noticed about Mega Evolution cards today, is that we're at the point where the cards have hit a new flooor. This will bring more buyers in, create more demand and we'll see a rise once again. So if you were after this card, now is likely the best time to get locked in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <title><![CDATA[Europa Universalis 5 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/europa-universalis-5-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/europa-universalis-5-review.1340716/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I load up Europa Universalis 5, Paradox's latest and most ambitious grand strategy game, I am reminded of a news report I once saw about a man who grew up in a tribal village seeing an airplane for the first time. This can't possibly be real, right? This giant piece of metal can't fly through the sky at hundreds of miles an hour? Attempting to conquer the 500-year period from 1337 to 1837 CE while modeling every single individual person in the world – yes, you heard that right – at a level of detail that's completely unprecedented, seems unbelievable. But it really does all of that. And it's generally quite engaging and enjoyable for a genre veteran like me. As for  whether it can soar? Only just. There is a lot of turbulence, and I wouldn't stake my life on it getting me to my destination without crashing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, let me say that this review is mostly based on a version I received on October 16th, and to a lesser extent on a medium-sized patch that came out on the 22nd and fixed a lot of bugs that were bothering me. There was an even larger patch on the 29th, but I was not able to do more than kick the tires on that before I locked in this review. And there's even one more big patch scheduled before launch. Overall, I think these patches have been improving the balance situation I'm going to talk about later, but there's no way I can say if they will have cleaned up all of the annoyances by the time you get your hands on it. I can only speak to what I played.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From a systems perspective, EU5 is an unambiguous wonder. Paradox keeps pushing the envelope on how much they can simulate in fine-grain detail, and I could even accuse this absurdly huge historical epic of taking things too far. It's certainly unwieldy in its bulk, and I fear especially that this will make it very difficult to balance. Fix one small thing and the ripples it sends out through the various interlocking mechanisms for economics, geography, demographics, and politics could possibly create 300 more. There's a certain hubris to it, if I might be so dramatic, and I've already seen some evidence of the problems it can cause.<br>But damn. DAMN! It is incredible to have the entire world depicted in this level of detail in a video game. For every one province in its predecessor, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/15/europa-universalis-iv-review">Europa Universalis 4</a>, there are roughly seven individual locations in Europa Universalis 5. And while each space on the map could only have a single, monolithic religion and culture in EU4, EU5's population mechanics represent the culture, religion, and social class of every living human individually. Having to think about population creates a rich relationship with each location in my country, and acts to balance so many things in a naturalistic way, without abstract currencies like "Administration Points." In EU4, terrain type was a single modifier. In EU5, topography, climate, and vegetation are all separate factors that can affect everything from agricultural output to combat.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>EU5 is for certified (or aspiring) grand strategy sickos only.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It is history nerd nirvana to simply scroll around the map and marvel at the amount of work that went into this. It's pretty slick-looking, too. I don't think it's necessarily Paradox's prettiest map. You will see some weird artifacts around areas of rough terrain and intricate coastlines that are a bit unsightly. For my money, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crusader-kings-3-review">Crusader Kings 3</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/victoria-3-review">Victoria 3</a> are a bit nicer to look at. But it is certainly the most detailed. And especially with the ability to render units moving around with varying cultures, social strata, tech levels, and even degrees of professionalism modeled in their uniforms – up to 30 in one formation depending on the number of troops – it's never boring to zoom in on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This does all mean that EU5 is for certified grand strategy sickos – and aspiring grand strategy sickos – only. Not for lack of providing a tutorial. That's here, and it's actually surprisingly good at getting you off to at least a walking start. Automation lets you hand off certain things to the AI until you're ready to micromanage them. The nested tooltips are very helpful, too, at least until you discover one of the many edge cases where they aren't. But I have over 2000 hours in EU4. It's my most-played game on Steam of all time. And even then, it took about an hour before I even felt comfortable unpausing EU5 – and dozens before I thought I knew what I was doing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And for me, that's not a bad thing! I think that trial-and-error learning period is part of the fun of this type of grand strategy game, and part of developing a relationship with it. But it takes a lot of patience, and I don't think Paradox is going to be expanding its audience much with this one. EU5 knows exactly who it's for, and it caters specifically to those people – people like me – very unapologetically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting into the groove of managing a nation can be incredibly engrossing. Planning out the site of a new market town, how it's going to connect up to my road network, and how I'm going to exploit the local resources in my workshops to turn a huge trade profit, is better than drugs. Control and proximity are brilliant new mechanics that model how you can’t necessarily govern something just because you painted it your color. And combined with a reworked estates system, there is an almost endless number of projects to do and challenges to face without ever leaving your borders. The geographic granularity here adds so much to nation management and warfare, which has evolved excellently with the new terrain modifiers and logistics systems. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That is, when everything is working correctly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Major bugs were infrequent and generally not game-ruining for me. Most of EU5's current problems are in what I'd call tuning. The numbers, the balance, and the AI simply aren't quite dialed in yet to provide a satisfying or historical-feeling experience. I saw weird stuff like Bohemia with one port on the Baltic colonizing half of Canada. The Holy Roman Empire entirely failed to consolidate. There was no clear victor in Turkey. Bordergore is everywhere. China is… horrifying. And weirdest of all, the Europeans colonized most of Australia, but never even discovered India for some reason. It's hard to say how much of this is typical, but I didn't have thousands of hours to play a statistically significant number of campaigns.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Most of EU5's current problems are in what I'd call tuning.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is kind of the vibe across the board. Nations will behave very strangely compared to what you'd expect. Borders become way too static after about 1500, even with the Protestant Reformation trying to mix things up. Historical countries don't often form. There are a lot of interesting situations and flavor events, but they don't result in a globe that reads as authentic. Also, despite efforts to slow down colonization, I still saw stuff like all of South America filled in with formal states by 1700, and the entire Kongo Basin speaking Italian. Either they invented Duolingo way early or cured malaria. Not sure which. And that stuff really bothers me. I don't need history to play out exactly as it did in our world, but some of this is just silly. I want it to look kind of plausible by the end. Historical-ish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I did also run into inconsistent crashes on one of my two full playthroughs. I had only four crashes across the entire 500 years I played as the mighty Norse colony of Greenland in my first run. My second run, as Portugal, I would sometimes get more than that in a single decade. I was able to find some workarounds after consulting Paradox about the issue, so it was playable, but very annoying. (Pro tip: turn off the buildings tab in the outliner if this is happening to you a lot. Worked wonders.) Paradox has a history of supporting their grand strategy games for many years after launch, with one recent exception (the tragic Imperator: Rome), so I do have a pretty good amount of faith that this stuff will get worked out. But I wouldn't blame anyone for waiting six months for a little more polish before diving in. And the sheer complexity of EU5's simulation does stoke some fears in me about if it's even possible to get it to behave nicely at all.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 4X Games</h3><p>The best games to explore, expand, exploit, and extol in 2024.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What I didn't really have to worry about was performance, thankfully. For such a CPU-intensive game, I was apprehensive about that. But I tried it out on three different processors: A Ryzen 7 3700X, a Ryzen 7 5800XT, and a Core i7 13620H laptop. Most of my playtime was on the 3700X, because that's my main desktop, and I didn't find slowdown to be much of an issue, despite being below Paradox's recommended specs. It was measurably slower than the i7 especially, but I still found the speed to be very playable, only seeing significant sluggishness if there was a massive war going on in the last 100 years or so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Days at the start of a run took less than a second to tick by on the 3700X, and it only got up to maybe around two seconds at worst by the 1800s, with a bit of extra lag at the start of each month when there are more things to calculate. An entire playthrough took me about 60 hours while playing at the fastest speed, including slowing down on purpose for most wars. It never ground to a halt or turned into a slideshow like Victoria 3 or Hearts of Iron 4 sometimes can in the late game, and the interface remains sharply responsive even when the simulation is chugging a little, which makes such a massive difference to me psychologically. Overall, I found the optimization to be almost astounding for the number of things going on.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Europa Universalis 5 might be the most on-paper impressive historical strategy game of all time, with its depth of simulation, ultra detailed map and demographics, and flavorful depiction of the half millennium that brought us from the middle ages into the modern world. At the moment, though, it is definitely hurting for some polish, particularly when it comes to general balance, tuning, and AI behavior. It doesn't really feel entirely done yet, and that's what you should probably expect if you decide to brave it as an early adopter. That being said, I think the foundation is very strong. Paradox has focused on the right things to maximize EU5's long-term potential – perhaps at the cost of day-one smoothness – as long as these devs can manage to wrangle its eminence effectively. The systems are excellent, and it's already an ocean-deep, exciting wargame and nation manager. With time and care, it could achieve hegemon status in the genre. But for now, that dream still lies somewhere over the horizon.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/europa-universalis-5-review]]></content:encoded>
