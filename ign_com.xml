            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After three days of competition, Q9 has emerged victorious at the 2025 Delta Force Invitational. The inaugural event, held at the Hangzhou Esports Center in China, brought together twelve of the world’s best Delta Force teams. But it was Q9 who ultimately stood above the rest and took home the lion’s share of the $500,000 prize pool. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Delta Force Invitational featured twelve teams that each qualified through region-specific qualifiers, each bringing their own playstyle and strategies. The teams competing included AKA, FL, FN, GS, Q9, STS, ESG, INK, ISG, LEG, MBA, and MG. Throughout the weekend, fans witnessed everything from carefully executed stealth operations to explosive final pushes. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/23/unnamed-1758628304548.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The tournament began with the Group Stage, where each team competed for a spot in either the Upper or Lower Bracket. FN, Q9, GS, MBA, ESG, and INK secured strong performances that placed them in the Upper Bracket, while FL, AKA, STS, LEG, MG, and ISG found themselves in the Lower Bracket, facing elimination pressure early on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the Bracket Stage, the competition intensified. During Upper Bracket Turn 1, Q9 and MBA were the first teams to advance to the Grand Final, while ESG, GS, INK, and FN were pushed down into Upper Bracket Turn 2. Meanwhile, in Lower Bracket Turn 1, FL and LEG were eliminated, while STS and MG headed to the Upper Bracket Turn 2, and ISG and AKA earned one last chance by moving forward into Lower Bracket Turn 2. This set up high-stakes clashes as the brackets narrowed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During Upper Bracket Turn 2, ESG and FN succeeded in advancing to the Grand Final, while GS, STS, INK, and MG dropped down into Lower Bracket Turn 2 for one last shot at victory. In Lower Bracket Turn 2, the tension peaked. INK and MG battled their way into the Grand Final, while AKA, STS, ISG and GS were eliminated after a hard-fought run.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/23/unnamed-1-1758628343653.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of the Grand Final, fans in the Hangzhou Esports Center were treated to a spectacular opening show that brought the game to life. The stage came alive with characters, tanks and battle scenes inspired by Delta Force, immersing the audience in the action before culminating in a performance of the iconic song Dawn, sung by Lithium Done. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Q9 set the tone in Round 1 of the Grand Final with a commanding performance, led by GuoR, who earned MVP honours with 2 kills, 2 assists, and 205 damage. But the competition quickly heated up in Round 2, when INK surged ahead by outpacing everyone in decoding a Mandelbrick. Kilzal was the star of the round, securing 6 kills and carrying his team to victory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Momentum shifted yet again in Round 3 as Q9 reclaimed dominance, with K1De stepping into the spotlight as MVP. In Round 4, ESG broke through with a show-stopping display, turning the match in their favour. DT proved unstoppable, racking up 5 kills to claim MVP. Round 5 saw Q9 refuse to back down, they seized the last Mandelbrick, with K1De earning his second MVP of the series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Heading into Round 6, it was all to play for. Q9 secured a prime position early and began decoding the Mandelbrick, forcing the other teams to scramble for an opening. None could break through, and with Q9 completing the decode, they locked in the invitational victory. But the map clock was still ticking, leaving room for a shake-up in the standings, and it was INK who endured the longest, gathering crucial assets to secure second place. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/23/unnamed-2-1758628378846.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Delta Force Invitational has proved just how much momentum the game’s competitive scene is building. With their victory, Q9 have laid claim to the top prize in Delta Force esports, but the question is, who will rise next to seize their own moment. The Delta Force Global League Season 3 is set to start next month. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/q9-crowned-winners-at-the-2025-delta-force-invitational]]></content:encoded>
