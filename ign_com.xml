            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Releasing on October 3.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-where-to-buy">available to preorder since June</a>, but only for PS5, Xbox, and PC gamers. We knew that the new game would be coming to the Switch 2, but it wasn't until recently that we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-will-launch-on-nintendo-switch-2-on-october-3">finally got a release date</a>. The Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 is set to arrive on October 3, almost a full month after its console and PC release. And as of today, you can now preorder your copy for $70.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder Borderlands 4 for Nintendo Switch 2</h2><div catalogid="48ada6cd-ff27-4739-b7b0-2cf5e7d895e0" id="226235"><div id="226235" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Borderlands 4 - Nintendo Switch 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As of right now, it looks like the standard edition of Borderlands 4 is the only version available to preorder on Amazon and GameStop. Both the console and PC currently have Super Deluxe Editions available for preorder that include additional content and fancy packaging. It's unclear at this time if the Switch 2 will get a physical release of the Super Deluxe Edition as well, but we'll update this page with any new information as soon as we have it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, the Super Deluxe edition <em>is</em> available to preorder <a href="https://zdcs.link/z62v5d?object_uuid=f0c6d5aa-6d28-4481-8280-ab58f5766e03&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">directly from the Nintendo eShop</a>. So if you want the benefits of that version without the actual physical copy of the game, that's one way to do it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Preorder Bonuses</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Although this is the standard edition of the game, preordering does come with a few bonuses when you buy from Amazon. Alongside the base game, you'll also get the Gilded Glory Pack. This features a Vault Hunter skin, a weapon skin, and an Echo-4 drone skin. You can see more <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/resources/borderlands-4-gilded-glory-pack" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">details about the pack from the 2K website</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Amazon's Preorder Price Guarantee?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've never actually preordered anything from Amazon before, it's worth noting that if you purchase this art book ahead of the release date, it includes Amazon's preorder price guarantee. According to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G4BRP7LCB9DSDNCR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon's own help page</a>, this means that if the price decreases between now and when the item ships, you'll pay the lowest price. So in this case, if any of these editions of the game get a discount before they actually start shipping then you'll pay whatever it dropped to rather than the full price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although not every preorder gets discounted, physical editions of games especially seem to rarely drop in price compared to other product categories before they actually release. That is especially true for popular Nintendo Switch games, which rarely receive discounts of any kind even after release.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 31, 2025 8:13 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-is-now-up-for-preorder-on-amazon]]></content:encoded>
