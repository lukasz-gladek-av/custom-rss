In light of this, Level-5 has announced some free DLC is on the way, in recognition of the new Fantasy Life's positive reception.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced on the <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/topics/250523_01/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Level-5 site</a>, the developer has confirmed free DLC is coming to Fantasy Life i. While no release date is set yet, the team is teasing some new recipes, as well as new content to "update the world" (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-free-dlc-update-the-world-announced" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gematsu</a>). It will also apparently allow players to utilize high-rarity weapons obtained from Treasure Groves and other sources.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time went <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-finally-locks-in-may-2025-release-date">live for early access on May 18</a>, with its full launch on May 21.

Business operations of Level-5 Comcept were transferred to the parent company after Inafune left. In a post from March 2025, Level-5 boss Akihiro Hino described Inafune's departure as an "unexpected challenge."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fantasy Life i has taken off though, which hopefully bodes well for the rest of Level-5's roster of upcoming games. The studio announced a slew of games in a February 2023 Nintendo Direct, and while some have released, others are still in development. The yet-to-be-released games include some heavy hitters, like futuristic detective RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/decapolice">DecaPolice</a> and the next installment in the Professor Layton series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and the New World of Steam</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to see when and how those games land, at least Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time players have some more chill life updates to look forward to.

For the duos out there though, it sounds like you'll need to be open to a third.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first">IGN's interview with Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki</a>, the Nightreign lead discussed the choice to lean on solos and trios as the core experience options. When asked why there's no option for a pair of players to drop in together without a matchmade third player, Ishizaki said it was overlooked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that," said Ishizaki. "As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start," Ishizaki continued. "And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed. So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if you're playing with just your favorite duos partner, be ready to accept a random third into your lives. Who knows? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-elden-ring-community-hero">You might match up with someone pretty good at the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're playing solo, it does sound like Elden Ring Nightreign takes that into account. Ishizaki said the parameters of Elden Ring Nightreign "adjust dynamically depending on the number of players in that session," so lone wolves shouldn't be too overwhelmed in single-player.</p><div id="top-25-fromsoftware-bosses" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3><h3>Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll have to find and locate some self-revive options, which are incorporated for those opting for single-player. And if you're playing trios, well, that's apparently what Elden Ring Nightreign is built around. Whether duos support shows up or not, having an extra hand around can't hurt against some of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-features-bosses-from-dark-souls">the fearsome bosses</a> waiting in Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign is out on May 30, 2025 for PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox One and Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
