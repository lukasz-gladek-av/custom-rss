            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After winning the Game of the Year gong for It Takes Two at the The Game Awards 2021 I’m certain that developer Hazelight Studios was positively brimming with ideas of what to do next. I’m certain of this because the team appears to have used every one of those ideas in Split Fiction. An enchanting and confident two-person adventure like no other, Split Fiction is non-stop, co-op satisfaction that had me smiling consistently as we progressed, parkoured, and pulverised our way through to one of the best finales I’ve ever played. Is it a puzzle platformer? Is it a third-person action adventure? Is it an extreme sports game, or a side-scroller, or a twin-stick shooter?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The answer is yes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Split Fiction is the story of two young and unsuccessful authors, Zoe and Mio, lured to a mysterious tech company by the prospect of finally being published. What they didn’t count on, however, was having their brains strip mined of every story they’ve ever conceived. When a scuffle involving a suspicious Mio thrusts her into Zoe’s personal instance within the computer system, the two find themselves forced to work together to escape and foil the company’s plot. Zoe and Mio are quickly and effectively established as polar opposites in everything from their attitudes to their accents, but Split Fiction wastes little time tossing them together. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Split Fiction is two proud middle fingers to the conga line of entitled tech bros who’ve decided art is a commodity that can be scraped, stolen, and repackaged by their plagiarism engines.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an easy-to-grasp premise, and it’s almost baffling that it hasn't come along in a dozen games already. That is, the idea of being trapped in an interactive, virtual world is a trope that’s been remixed repeatedly in film for decades. Of course, Split Fiction nonetheless arrives in 2025 as a particularly timely takedown of our grim future of being drenched in AI slop against our will. The fact that, at its heart, Split Fiction is two proud middle fingers to the conga line of entitled tech bros who’ve decided art is a commodity that can be scraped, stolen, and repackaged by their plagiarism engines only adds to its charm.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Non-friction</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As with It Takes Two before it, Split Fiction’s platforming is immediately on point. With a jump, double-jump, and air dash at each character’s disposal, Split Fiction boasts the same high degree of aerial maneuverability as its predecessor. Wall runs can be spectacularly chained, grappling hooks are thrilling swings or slingshots, and rails, poles, and tiny landing spots have a soft lock that draws Zoe and Mio onto them – so long as you’ve pointed them largely in the right direction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is a movement system that’s extremely approachable and easy to become adept with quite fast, and one that focuses on momentum and timing rather than getting too bogged down punishing tiny mistakes or a lack of expert-level finesse. It’s like having just one bumper up in a bowling alley; it’s happy to give you a slight nudge in the right direction on occasion, but it’s not going to render you immune from making mistakes entirely. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My only real criticism of the platforming is that there are a few occasions where it becomes tricky to catch up after falling behind your partner, as one player hurtles ahead and the other gets stuck in a brief loop of dying and respawning trying to get back on track. It’s also a minor bugbear having both Zoe and Mio simply clipping through each other whenever they occupy the same space, as it results in a surprisingly unfinished look. Make no mistake, having one character become an actual obstacle for the other would totally destroy the snappy pace of Split Fiction, but it would’ve looked so much better (and still made perfect sense) with some kind of digitised effect breaking up Zoe and Mio’s avatars whenever they found themselves perched on the same tiny platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At any rate, Split Fiction’s fast-paced platforming is perfect for its exclusively co-op approach, particularly when played by people of differing skill levels, as it’s mostly frictionless. Die outside of a boss battle and you’ll rapidly respawn near your partner automatically. Die <em>within </em>a boss battle and you can re-enter the fray after some brief button mashing. Checkpoints are generously frequent, even during boss fights. Chip their health down to halfway and you won’t need to repeat an encounter entirely, even if both Zoe and Mio are defeated at the same time. This is welcome because, as incredibly imaginative as the many bosses are, it’s not unusual to suffer a couple of cheap deaths during the fights – commonly after getting respawned under a salvo of deadly attacks that wipe you out the instant you blink back into existence. As such they were only ever brief setbacks, and we never had to repeat anything to the degree it felt like a chore.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Split Fiction - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall it’s not a particularly difficult game for, say, two dads with somewhere in the vicinity 80 years of video game literacy between them, but I don’t crave punishing difficulty and never have. For me Split Fiction soars thanks to its satisfying focus on communication, collaboration, and constant variety. It’s figuring out the path and the joy of suggesting the right puzzle solution. It’s laughing at untimely misunderstandings knowing the penalty for failure is never especially severe. It’s deciding whether to go on three, or if it’s one, two, three, <em>GO!</em> Split Fiction is nothing if not a game that makes you know what it would feel like to need your best friend to drag you off your booby-trapped toilet before it explodes. You’ve all seen Lethal Weapon 2, right? I did mention we’re a pair of 40-year-old dads, yeah?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Split Fiction is nothing if not a game that makes you know what it would feel like to need your best friend to drag you off your booby-trapped toilet before it explodes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Watching two of my kids play after I’ve finished it I’ve since seen a couple of possible bottlenecks (related to timing their way past a deadly obstacle) but if less experienced players have no one around to swoop in and save the day, the option to simply skip forward to the next checkpoint is available as a last resort. Split Fiction doesn’t want to stall anyone indefinitely. It wants to be played.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Clever, bending story</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Split Fiction is so good at wanting to be played it’s hard to <em>stop </em>playing. It simply doesn’t stay the same long enough for it to ever become boring. If you’ve ever wondered whether it would be possible to squeeze SSX and Shadow of the Colossus into the same story, wonder no more. Split Fiction found a way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zoe and Mio are fantasy and sci-fi authors respectively, and the action is essentially divided equally between the two genres, but the fantasy and sci-fi branches of Split Fiction are anything but static. That is, the story doesn’t pendulum between a single sci-fi world and a single fantasy world repeatedly for 14-hours – the levels are always different, each with their own special hooks. Mio’s mental archive of sci-fi ideas range from a neon-splashed, futuristic city full of flying traffic – with gravity-defying cyber ninjas that will have you and a partner helping each other down a high-altitude highway while operating on <em>totally different axes</em> – to a space complex next to a dying star releasing pulsing blasts that will disintegrate Zoe and Mio if they’re caught out of cover. That’s just two, and I’m extremely hesitant to drill down on any more. Not knowing how each new level and side story will shake up the backdrop and the gameplay is a huge part of what makes Split Fiction such tremendous fun to scoot through. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zoe’s fantasy worlds are initially a bit twee by comparison, and generally had me looking forward to the short sci-fi diversions that are scattered throughout, but they do feature the better boss battles (I’m reluctant to spoil the specifics of any of those either but, broadly speaking, the fantasy bosses are more impressive in size and have personalities than make them vastly more memorable). The fantasy portion does peak later in the story as it becomes a little darker and more grand-scale, which is a good springboard for the lengthy and meticulously engineered final level. It’s not just the most impressively executed stretch of Split Fiction overall; it’s one of the most memorable finales I’ve ever played. Split Fiction is a fine-looking game throughout, but the spectacle of the entire ending segment is a real visual victory for Hazelight.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">An expertly crafted and absorbing co-op adventure that pinballs from one genre extreme to another, Split Fiction is a rollercoaster of gameplay ideas and styles that are usually discarded as quickly as they’re introduced. This keeps it fabulously fresh for its full, 14-hour duration. With no idea sticking around long enough to get stale before making way for the next, it’s a victory of imagination and restraint in equal measure. Hazelight may have been rewriting the co-op rule book for a decade now, but Split Fiction is a new chapter that you (and a partner) cannot miss.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/absolum-is-a-gorgeous-roguelite-from-the-makers-of-streets-of-rage-4<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Streets of Rage 4 developer Guard Crush Games is once again partnering up with publisher Dotemu for a beat-’em-up. This time, though, it’s Dotemu’s first original IP, with gorgeous hand-drawn-styled animation from Supamonks and a soundtrack by decorated video game score composer Gareth Coker. That’s a lot of talent on one unproven project, but if my hourlong hands-on with that project – it’s called Absolum – is any indication, it’s not going to be unproven for very long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Absolum is a roguelite side-scrolling beat-’em-up action-RPG designed for, in the developers’ words, “deep replayability with branching paths to explore, quests, characters, and challenging bosses.” I can attest to all of those things being true. It’s an absolutely gorgeous fantasy romp with multiple player classes – I got to try out the tank-y dwarf-like Karl and the lank-y ranger-ish sword-wielding Galandra – where you kill evil creatures, smash up the environments (often hoping a carrot or other health-replenishing pickup will reveal itself), duck into the occasional building to pop open treasure chests or get ambushed by goblins, battle bosses with gargantuan health bars, die, and repeat the whole thing over again. Oh, and though I didn’t get to try it, you can also play two-player same-screen co-op. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For me, someone who has fond memories of many a two-player beat-’em-up back in 1980’s and early-’90s arcades as well as games like Golden Axe on the Sega Genesis, Absolum felt nostalgically familiar in a good way – perhaps owing to its Saturday morning cartoon-style art and animation. And you’ve got a relatively shallow but nevertheless slightly layered two-button combat system that allows you to mix up attacks depending on the enemy in front of you. But the roguelite element modernizes it in a way that gives it both an edge and a ton of obvious built-in replayability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you go, you’ll discover both hidden and obvious power-ups – some are equippable active weapons or spells that are activated by pulling one of the triggers and then hitting the corresponding face button, and others are passives that live in your inventory. All will randomize from one run to the next, but not all the items are necessarily desirable. Or at least, there’s a serious risk-reward system that might change your approach in that run. For instance, in one early run, I picked up not one but TWO orbs that gave me a 20% boost to damage, but at the expense of 20% of my health. So with both of them I had a frighteningly small health bar, but I could dispatch enemies pretty quickly. Fortunately, you can drop any item from your inventory at any time if you’d rather not deal with the trade-off of a particular power-up.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Absolum - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I did say this is a roguelite, so that means when – not if – you die, the realm you return to has a shop where you can spend in-game currency to buy items or power-ups for the next run. This wasn’t fully working yet in the early build I played, leaving me at the whim of what amounted to a dice roll regarding the quality of items and power-ups on each new run. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Absolum has a ton of potential, and dare I say even a high probability of being good.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Because I couldn’t spend any of the hard-earned gold in between runs, I had a heck of a time with the first major boss – who I sadly don’t have footage of, but at least I can show you another, later boss that looks far tougher. But mine was a mammoth troll that swung a gigantic mace, and who’d summon smaller goblins, some of whom would leap onto you and start biting away at your face like they were piranhas. I would’ve loved to have gotten a chance to experience two-player co-op, as it would not only split the boss’s attention, but as anyone who shares those fond memories of the beat-’em-ups of yore knows, these kinds of games shine brightest in two-player mode. Always. Every single time. No exceptions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But still, between the art style, animation, old-school side-scrolling beat-’em-up gameplay, and roguelite loop – not to mention the developer’s pedigree in this genre – Absolum has a ton of potential, and dare I say even a high probability of being good. If you’ve been lamenting the loss of couch co-op games over the years, Absolum is almost certainly one that’s going to stem that tide, at least for a little while. I’m very much looking forward to playing a more polished build as development progresses, but for now, I’m incredibly optimistic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.
