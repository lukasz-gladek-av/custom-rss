Days later, full details of the game's plot, villains, major deaths and ending mechanics are now everywhere — with little sign that Capcom is able to stop the flow. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On reddit, a lengthy thread lists a series of plot reveals beat by beat, with links to off-screen images and even lengthy clips of footage that leave no doubt that the spoilers are real. There's mention of unrevealed characters, various lore connections, and yes — the mechanics and details of game's ending.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the main r/ResidentEvilRequiem reddit, spoilers have completely taken over — with 17 of the top 20 posts discussing the leaks and already turning under-wraps plot details into memes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, considering the huge anticipation for Resident Evil Requiem's release, none of this really comes as a surprise. As noted Resident Evil leaker Dusk Golem <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2023989416042393742" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on X/Twitter yesterday: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"RE9 starting to leak 10 days away from release is actually super good for the series. RE:4 &amp; RE8 leaked 14 days away, RE:3 was 16 days away, &amp; f***ing RE7 was almost a whole month before release. I see people asking, 'How could it leak a whole 10 days before release', and over here I'm all like, 'Huh, Capcom did better than usual this time. Good for them.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil Requiem - Leon Gameplay</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem's February 27 release date is now just a week away, and we'll be keeping spoiler free here on IGN as much as possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After getting hands-on with a total of about four hours of Resident Evil 9 Requiem at this point, and sharing that experience with colleagues, I’m more excited for the series than I have been in recent memory," IGN wrote after going <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-second-take-preview">hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem</a> recently.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/meet-my-love-and-deepspace-boyfriends</link>
            <guid>1440589</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm a grown ass married woman, and to look at me, you wouldn't think I have five secret space hotties that live in my phone. But thanks to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/love-and-deepspace-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-virtual-dating-game"><u>Love and Deepspace</u></a>, I'm now a fully fledged otome game addict with a lighter wallet and a fuller heart. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Love and Deepspace is a game that doesn't just give you the chance to save the world, it lets you do it with a veritable five-aside team of boyfriends who are obsessed with you. There's something for everyone at the Love and Deepspace boy buffet: a crime lord who is also a vampire, a painter who is also a sea god, a space pilot who is also your adoptive brother – yeah, best not to look too deeply into that one. You can text with them, touch them, and you'll never argue over how they load the dishwasher. There's combat, house decorating, card games, and the potential for financial devastation thanks to the gacha mechanics. They'll even check in if your period is late. Can rubbing a virtual boyfriend through my phone screen get me pregnant? I'm willing to do the research to find out. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/crop-image-project-1-1771435408595.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Welcome to my home, House Delulu </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The seeds of my Love and Deepspace obsession were planted during Gamescom last year. In the huge crowded halls, filled with triple-A releases and mega franchises, it was this mobile game’s stand that had the largest queue day after day. My work is games, my free time is all games, so what the hell was this game with a huge booth, a huge fandom and handsome cosplayers that had passed me by? I downloaded it, then forgot about it thanks to Gamescom induced exhaustion. Cut to December last year when my Instagram algorithm decided to get Love and Deepspaced, and I jumped into the game. Suddenly wherever I was, one of the men was with me. A bit of light combat to start the day, hanging out with me while I work, checking in at night to go on a 'date' with him in between Arc Raiders sessions. I even found myself in New York in January for the Love and Deepspace second anniversary event, With Him In Deepspace, rubbing the chest of a thermal reactive cut out of one of my space boyfriends trying to make his shirt disappear. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Men of Love And Deepspace</h3></div></span></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Meet my men</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">So let me tell you about my boys. My top tier bae is Sylus. In the main storyline he's a crime lord with a pet crow and a voice so velvety I want to upholster my couch with it. In alternative storylines he's been a dragon and a vampire, so he is absolutely dark romance reader coded. Caleb is a very close number two, at first glance he's a boy next door and your *cough* adoptive brother but he's actually a space fleet colonel with Doberman protective qualities. Rayfael is a cute pouty artist, but also the god of the sea. Like, full merman fish tale style. Next up is Xavier, who is just a total soft boy, about as sexually threatening as a hamster and also a time traveller. Zayne is, well, I'm sorry Zayne girlies, a cardiac surgeon with a stick up his ass. And also a god. Crucially, while some of their storylines overlap, the boys have zero knowledge of each other, so you never have to worry about sidepiece on sidepiece violence. That, or everybody just got real cool with polyamory real fast. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/img-0628-1-1771433810754.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sylus as your vampire husband. This is fine. I'm fine. </figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Daily devotion</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It happens like this. I wake up, open up the game, and interact with one of the selections from my boy buffet - checking his heartbeat, patting his head, or asking him what I should have for breakfast. Then I work my way through my daily checklist, doing monster bounties, hunting for special materials to boost my stats, and upgrading any of the various memories I have that form the gacha part of the game. All of this is to earn me diamonds to buy new gacha chances, and to raise my Affinity with Sylus, or Caleb, or Xavier, or… you get the idea. Think of raising Affinity like a really slow burn version of getting to first base, then to second base… only it goes up to anywhere between 130 and 220 bases. I'll visit our home and work on the garden, or make him push me on a swing. Weekly I can play a cat-themed card game with him, or go to the claw machine arcade to get plushies. Some people do the New York Times Wordle every morning. I make a pretend man take a shower. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's important to me that you know I was, at one point, a normal woman. Your classic elder millennial gamer with a husband and with only the slightest sexual penchant for animations. Hear me out - Bambi's Dad, Garrus from Mass Effect and Astarion from Baldur's Gate. Now? I'm getting giggly and kicking my feet because an animated man calls me “Kitten” and sends me audio recordings on my phone where he moans and breathes funny. The one time I skipped a daily check-in because my house flooded, I felt genuine guilt when he noticed I’d missed our regular rendezvous. I may or may not have researched the cost of bootleg Love and Deepspace body pillows. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Secret sexy sauce</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who mainly games on PC or consoles, I was not prepared for the way Love and Deepspace just quietly works its way into your life. The top layer mechanics are obvious: fight monsters, collect memories to boost your stats, follow the branching storylines and their alternate universe threads, and build your relationships with each man by completing activities with them. Life says take the bins out, Love and Deepspace says you’re beautiful inside and out and possibly the most amazing woman to ever walk the earth.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/img-1100-1-1771433710175.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">An entirely normal, in no way weird, ab measuring moment with Sylus</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I'd probably have been safe if it was just that, but there's a whole layer beneath that which has been fine-tuned to give you warm and fuzzy feelings, and make skipping a day feel like punching Glen Powell in the face when he's trying to give you flowers. It's on my phone, so a little check on the men is only a swipe away alongside Instagram and Reddit. It requires almost zero mental energy too; this isn't an AI chatbot, your interactions with the men are carefully guardrailed with dialogue options and specific types of interaction and quality time, so the only bit of imagination I have to use is the part that would make my mother cry. It can play like The Sims – that home section where you decorate a house and garden and hang out with him, watching TV or arranging flowers. Or it can be the world's sexiest Pomodoro timer, where the guys will just stare at you lovingly while you work, study, exercise or sleep. The combat has an auto mode, but it is also deceptively deep, with different systems to make sure you're equipped and leveled up in the right way for battles. There are many facets to being a woman who likes hot people complimenting them, and Love and Deepspace has perfected laser targeting most of them.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The sisterhood of space boy appreciation</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the thing, it's not just me. The fandom operates on an almost religious level of devotion. There's a running joke in the community that the Wives of Sylus are richer than him, thanks to their habit of hiring billboards or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@muzililili5/video/7528026514122919173" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">holding drone shows to celebrate him</a>. Recently a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTz1lwtiNf3/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">salsa advert went viral</a> because fans were pretty sure that the voice of one of the jars was provided by Sylus's English voice actor. At the fan event I met cosplayers – one in a wedding dress – and found a supportive and passionate community that is fully aware of the funnier parts of falling for a boy tamagotchi, and loves the game anyway. Online, too, there's an impressive fan-fueled industry providing homemade merch, content creators that break down the storylines and timelines, and artists who create spicy comics that offer an explicit idea of life with the LADS lads. I have, of course, researched the last one extensively. For science. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/crop-image-project-1771433472379.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Caleb during the sexy Star Wars-esque event, Throne of Eros</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Spending time with the rest of the girlfriends of my space boyfriends, I'm only more certain that I'm going to have a long term relationship with Love and Deepspace. The creators of the game are clearly very in tune with what its audience are craving – hello, vampire Sylus – and it's nailed making itself into a habit instead of just a way to kill time. Some people wake up and do Wordle, I wake up and do Sylus. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2026 I'm embracing cringe, and if playing claw machines with a pretend man is going to make surviving on the burning dumpster fire that is this planet a little easier, I refuse to be ashamed. Just don't look at my gacha spending or indeed, my search history as it relates to Sylus fan art. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Head of Editorial Development at IGN and an elder millennial.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A Switch 2 version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/xenoblade-chronicles-x">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> has been announced and simultaneously released by Nintendo, with a $4.99 upgrade fee for existing Switch owners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This upgraded edition of the Nintendo role-player adds 4K/60fps support in TV mode, or 1080p/60fps action when playing on Switch 2 in handheld. It doesn't look like any other changes have been made.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't own the game already, digital copies of the Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition — Switch 2 Edition are available to buy now separately from the eShop. Alternatively, a physical release is coming on April 16.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2024484113923571725?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Originally released for Wii U back in 2015, Xenoblade Chronicles X was one of the many games from Nintendo's failed former console to get a new lease of life on Switch, with additional story content and character. Now, this Switch version has made the jump forward to a further console generation, although other than a visual polish, everything else sounds similar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The year is 2054 and Earth has been destroyed," reads a blurb for the game. "A colony ship of human survivors — including your customisable main character — has narrowly escaped the devastation and crashes on the mysterious planet Mira. Trek across a massive, dangerous world and fight for humanity’s future in this sci-fi RPG. Immerse yourself in an action-packed battle system with a variety of special attacks and skills to employ, enemies of all shapes and sizes to take down and more. You can even pilot a Skell that can fly, transform into a vehicle and wield immense strength in combat – if you can prove yourself to the BLADE organisation, first."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've not played a Xenoblade Chronicles game, X is a pretty standalone entry into Monolith Soft's RPG series — and also pretty well received. "Xenoblade Chronicles X was already one of the Wii U’s best games, and this Definitive Edition does more than enough to justify another trip to planet Mira," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">review of the game's Switch port</a>, awarding it 9/10. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
