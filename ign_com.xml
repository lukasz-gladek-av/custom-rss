            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Harry Potter is one of those franchises that has now infiltrated pretty much every medium. There are endless <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-harry-potter-gift-ideas">Harry Potter gifts for every type of fan</a> out there, but if your specific interest is in puzzles, there's some serious variety available to you. Just a quick search for "Harry Potter puzzles" will drown you in options from various brands that can take a while to sort through.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR – These Are the Best Harry Potter Puzzles</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As a fan of both Harry Potter and puzzles, I have taken it upon myself to help you find the right Potter puzzle for you. Below I've gathered some of my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzles-for-adults">favorite adult jigsaw puzzles</a> with a Harry Potter theme, as well as some great options for kids. I've also included an awesome model kit that makes for an exciting 3D puzzling experience.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marauder's Map Puzzle</h3><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215775"><div id="215775" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Marauder's Map Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Marauder%27s_Map" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marauder's Map</a> is one of the most recognizable items from Harry Potter lore. From Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, this puzzle looks like the full map from the movie once it's been assembled. The puzzle itself is from The Noble Collection, which is known for making some of the highest quality officially licensed wand and Harry Potter prop replicas. You can see what the fully assembled puzzle looks like below:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hogwart's Express Puzzle</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215776"><div id="215776" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hogwart's Express Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Hogwarts Express puzzle from Buffalo games depicts Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid as they were at the end of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/harry-potter-and-the-sorcerers-stone">The Sorcerer's Stone</a>. The train is set against a beautiful sunset backdrop, and we also see Malfoy sitting on a bench with Goyle at his side. It's a great-looking jigsaw puzzle from one of the most iconic scenes from the first film of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-movies-in-order">Harry Potter movie series</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Herbology Puzzle</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215777"><div id="215777" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Herbology Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This herbology puzzle is my favorite option on this list. It depicts various ingredients students would find and grow in herbology class. At the center of it all is a mandrake in all its weird root baby glory. The design of this puzzle is reminiscent of the classic drawings you'd find in a vintage botanical identification diagram and makes for a great display piece.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hogwarts Crest Wooden Puzzle</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215778"><div id="215778" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hogwarts Crest Wooden Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Hogwarts Crest puzzle is made up of 201 laser-cut wooden pieces. It depicts the Hogwarts crest, including all four houses, and a vibrant floral design. What makes this puzzle interesting is that it comes with many unique pieces you'll recognize from the books and movies. These pieces include a witch's hat, the Goblet of Fire, and the Deathly Hallows symbol. It's a great puzzle for both kids and adults to put together.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hogwarts Castle Puzzle</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215779"><div id="215779" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hogwarts Castle Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This 3,000-piece Hogwarts Castle puzzle is an excellent option for anyone looking for something more challenging. The image depicts the majority of Hogwarts Castle and grounds, including Hagrid's hut. There are also owls, a phoenix, a hippogriff, and various other small details that make this larger puzzle really fun to piece together. It's made by Ravensburger, which is our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">overall favorite puzzle brand</a> on the market right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like the massive size of this puzzle, you may want to check out the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/largest-jigsaw-puzzles">largest puzzles out there</a>. 3,000 pieces is nothing compared some of these.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hogwarts Express 3D Puzzle Model Kit</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215780"><div id="215780" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hogwarts Express 3D Puzzle Model Kit</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While not a traditional puzzle, this 3D model kit of the <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hogwarts_Express" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hogwarts Express</a> belongs on this list because of how cool it is. The kit comes with eight sheets of 181 pieces that you'll need to put togehter. No glue or tools are required to assemble the train, but it may be difficult for young children to piece together. Overall, this is a really different kind of puzzle and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-lego-alternatives">excellent alternative to the LEGO Hogwarts express</a> that is extremely pricey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't mind spending a bit more, there is also a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-lego-book-nook-sets">LEGO Book Nook set</a> for the Hogwarts Express that is worth checking out.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hogwarts Map</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215781"><div id="215781" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hogwarts Map</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The second Ravensburger puzzle I'm featuring on this list also depicts Hogwarts castle and grounds, but in map form. The map itself has a rather whimsical design and features a variety of notable locations including <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hogsmeade" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hogsmeade</a> and the <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbidden Forest</a>. The puzzle also includes a border featuring small images of various other locations from the story. At 1,500 pieces, it is a bit more challenging that some of the other puzzles on this list, but the end result is worthy of displaying.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Enchanted Car Mini Puzzle</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215782"><div id="215782" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Enchanted Car Mini Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for a good Harry Potter puzzle for kids, this 100-piece mini puzzle from The New York Puzzle Company is a great option. The image shows Ron and Harry flying in the enchanted car with Hogwarts in the background. This is an iconic point of the story in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/harry-potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets">The Chamber of Secrets</a>, and the design of this image looks like the original cover artwork from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-books-in-order">Harry Potter books</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Gryffindor Crest Puzzle</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215783"><div id="215783" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gryffindor Crest Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Every true fan knows which house they belong to. Whether you're in Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff, there is a crest puzzle available from Aquarius. I've featured the Gryffindor design here, but each house is has its own crest and background color. At just 500 pieces, these smaller puzzles are great if you want to spend an afternoon finishing a single image.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Harry Potter Puzzle for Kids</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215784"><div id="215784" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Harry Potter Puzzle for Kids</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The final Ravensburger puzzle I have on this list is specifically meant for kids. Not only is it just 100 extra-large pieces, it features bright colors and recognizable characters that make it fairly easy to put together. The box says it is meant for ages six and older, so it should be simple enough for younger kids to handle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What About Harry Potter LEGO Sets Instead?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Jigsaw puzzles are an excellent choice for any fan of Harry Potter and puzzling, but it isn't the only option available. There are a ton of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-lego-harry-potter-sets">LEGO Harry Potter sets available</a> that depict iconic scenes and characters from across the entire series. These LEGO sets <em>are</em> quite a bit more expensive than the puzzles on this list, but many of them are easier to play with and display than a simple puzzle once put together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jacob Kienlen is a Senior SEO Strategist and Writer for IGN.

Kyle Katarn, the hero of the video game, is getting a Star Wars The Black Series action figure. It costs $27.99 and will be available on April 1.

It comes with a blaster and a blue-bladed Lightsaber, with a standard blade and one that mimics the blurred swinging effect. It’s a figure that looks good enough for adults to enjoy as a collectible, but it works equally well for play, with a suggest age range of 4+. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-dark-forces">Star Wars: Dark Forces hit PC in 1995</a>, with a port to PS1 the following year. It’s one of the early “Doom clones,” but it had strong enough story and gameplay elements to stand up on its own. Gameplay-wise, it included novel ideas like the ability to jump and duck, as well as to look up and down, all of which Doom and Doom 2 lacked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Forces is set in the (no-longer-canon) extended universe, around the time of the first Star Wars movie. It follows Kyle Katarn, a mercenary working for the Rebel Alliance, as he uncovers the Dark Troopers Project and goes about trying to stop it. This mission brings him all over the galaxy to locations like Jabba’s yacht, the Imperial mines on Gromas, inside a Star Destroyer, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars: Dark Forces got the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-dark-forces-remaster">remaster treatment</a> last year, making it accessible on modern platforms and tweaking its graphics and adding various quality-of-life improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hybrid-action-rpg-duet-night-abyss-launches-globally-with-new-monetization-system.1337509/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Free-to-play hybrid action RPG Duet Night Abyss is out now worldwide on PC, mobile devices, and Epic Games Store featuring a dual narrative with two protagonists, no stamina limits for movement or commissions, and no character or weapon gacha systems. Let’s get into the details of what this game has to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Duet Night Abyss takes place in the world of Atlasia, where tree-like crystals called Heaventrees were viewed as gifts from the gods and gave rise to a central religion called the Elysian Church. Originally, practically everyone followed this religion, but over time, groups broke off and formed their own factions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play through the story from the perspectives of two protagonists with very different backgrounds, and you can freely choose and deploy each of them across different chapters. You’ll meet people from several of Atlasia’s different factions, and you can unlock many of them as playable characters by using character shards, which can be obtained either by buying the exact number you need for a specific character or by collecting them through gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters are not sorted into tiers or star ratings, all of them are just as viable in combat as the others. There are also no character gacha banners where you have to spend resources and just hope you eventually get what you want. You can identify the character you want, gather the required crystals, and be 100% guaranteed to unlock that character.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/image-4-1761248741433.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As the developers said when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/duet-night-abyss-dev-team-discusses-the-games-narrative-combat-and-latest-updates"><u>we interviewed them in August</u></a>, this was in response to player feedback and was with the goal of making the game more accessible to free-to-play (F2P) players. And as part of the game’s global launch rewards, players can complete events to unlock seven characters for free, giving you the opportunity to build the team you want right from the start. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter what characters you want to use in battle, you can equip them with both melee and ranged weapons and swap between them on the fly. Every character has access to every weapon type, so you can freely equip them however you want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Melee weapon options include standard choices like swords, polearms, and greatswords, as well as more unique ones like the whipsword. There are also a variety of ranged options, from a bow and arrow to dual pistols, grenade launchers, and shotguns. And like characters, weapons aren’t locked behind banners and aren’t sorted into different tiers or star ratings. So you can use whichever combination of weapons you want with no optimization lost.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/melee-and-ranged-weapons-1761248804318.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat will pit you against waves of enemies in hack-and-slash action, where you’ll mow down hordes of foes in seconds. The flow of combat stays quick thanks to the fact there are several mobility options with no stamina requirements, so no need to keep your eye on a gauge to see what moves you can use. At any time, you can sprint, use a grappling hook, dodge, jump, double jump, wall jump, or Helix Leap, which in one button press allows you to cover very long distances very quickly.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/image-6-1761248842756.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can tackle commissions with up to three players in co-op mode, or go solo with two AI companions. There are no stamina restrictions for commissions either, so you’re not limited to only a certain amount of time you can play freely. And you can further customize your fighting style with Demon Wedges, which are versatile add-ons that you can obtain during commissions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Demon Wedges come in three varieties: character, melee weapon, and ranged weapon. They can provide boosts to your health, crit rate, attack speed, and other attributes. These boosts are guaranteed at a set level when you acquire and upgrade them, so you don’t have to keep grinding for the same thing and hoping to get a better version. There’s no randomization involved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of stat boosts, Demon Wedges can also change the mechanics of your characters’ attacks and skills, and you can combine these with certain weapon traits to customize your attack pattern. And once you’ve acquired a Demon Wedge, you can use it across as many characters or weapons as you want. So again, no need to farm for additional versions to equip multiple of them.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/image-7-1761248877455.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters, weapons, and Demon Wedges can all be obtained through normal gameplay. The game’s monetization model is currently focused only on cosmetics, with a range of character skins, accessories, patterns, dye colors, and weapon skins. Both outfits and weapons can be dyed, allowing for an additional level of customization.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/24/character-skins-1761338540276.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers recently unveiled new skins for the characters Psyche, Rebecca, and the duo Truffle and Filbert. They also revealed Christmas-themed skins and a new sword skin called Tough Love. And as part of the game’s global launch rewards, players can get up to 107 Pristine Hourglass and Prismatic Hourglass just for logging in. These items can be used to draw new skins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Duet Night Abyss is available to download now on PC, iOS, and Android.
