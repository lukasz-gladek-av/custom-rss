I either go on a second scuba dive or I go to the gym and work out. Then I work. I live on a boat, so I just hang out with everybody on the boat."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I work seven days a week," he added. "I'm working from my bedroom, as you can tell. I like working. It's fun. To me, it doesn't feel like work. The kinds of things that I get to do every day are super awesome. I've said it before, but when you retire, you want to stop doing your horrible job and then go do what is most fun and entertaining. And so in that sense, I've been retired for a long time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expanding on the types of work that keep him busy these days, Newell said: "Getting to work with Drew and Jeremy on AI stuff or Chris on Steam stuff... In one of the companies, we're working on an aerosol pathogen detection device so you can see all the pathogens that are in the air. Brain computer interfaces are incredibly cool, and all of the associated neuroscience is incredibly cool. So, I just work all the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But it's not like, 'Oh my God, I'm up late at night slaving away on stuff.' It's more like I can't go to sleep because I'm having fun, you know?"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve, the studio behind seminal hits like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life"><u>Half-Life</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/left-4-dead"><u>Left 4 Dead</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dota-2"><u>Dota 2</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/counter-strike"><u>Counter-Strike</u></a>, is also the company behind the industry-leading Steam online game platform, plus the acclaimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/steam-deck"><u>Steam Deck</u></a> handheld system.
