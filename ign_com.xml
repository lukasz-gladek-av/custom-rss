            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> developer Embark Studios has fully detailed the game’s Cold Snap update and its new cold-weather survival mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The update, out December 16, adds the new Cold Snap map condition, which is a winter variant across Dam Battlegrounds, Buried City, Spaceport, and The Blue Gate maps. Cold Snap adds cold-weather survival mechanics fueled by snowstorms across Speranza. Snowfall reduces visibility, lakes freeze over, and the open surface becomes even more dangerous. Exposure to extreme cold causes frostbite, thus encouraging new strategies around healing items, loadouts, and indoor shelter.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arc Raiders Cold Snap gameplay changes, from Embark Studios:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Environmental Hazard:</strong> Cold, harsh weather introduces new risks for raiders who remain outdoors too long. Players must watch out for frostbite, a creeping condition that slowly drains their health bar. </li><li><strong>Shelter Mechanics:</strong> To prevent frostbite, raiders will need to adapt their tactics as the cold gradually seeps into their bones. Raiders must rethink their loadouts, ensuring they can heal themselves or their teammates and plan their extractions with care, finding shelter if needed.</li><li><strong>Visual Overhaul:</strong> Frost buildup, frozen lakes, snow accumulation and more across Dam Battlegrounds, Buried City, Spaceport and The Blue Gate maps.</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, unique loot and rewards are available through the Flickering Flames event and Candleberry Banquet project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flickering Flames Event:</strong> An act of endurance and patience that tests Raiders’ survival skills during the Cold Snap. Raiders can unlock rewards across 25 levels, including new gear, customizations elements and Raider Tokens by earning Merits, which are automatically gained from XP in rounds. To activate the event, Raiders must have played five rounds of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Candleberry Banquet Project:</strong> A new project that brings Raiders together to feel the fragile warmth that shines through the frigid cold. Raiders can earn rewards by scavenging unique items topside and collecting Candleberries. It features five stages, each revealing a new scene on the banquet table. Completing stages grants rewards such as cosmetic items, Raider Tokens and Merits, with Merits contributing progress in the Flickering Flames event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting December 26, the Goalie Raider deck will be included in the base game. The new deck includes new items and feats for players to complete, offering rewards such as Raider tokens, cosmetic items and more. These include a hockey-inspired Raider outfit in several color variants, along with a hockey stick Raider tool.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Arc Raiders Cold Snap Update Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, the Expedition Project Raider Reset lets players restart their journey with certain buffs, advantages, and rewards. The Expedition Project will provide Raiders with an opportunity to undergo a reset, bringing a new raider and a new story for the player. This optional reset is unlocked by collecting key materials to build a Caravan for the existing Raider then signing up for the departure during the Expedition window. By departing, players will reset their character progress for a new Arc Raiders journey with exclusive buffs, advantages and rewards that carry over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/de/news/the-expedition-project-is-departing-soon" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Embark explained why it’s doing the seasonal reset. “Progression wipes are a notoriously difficult thing to balance in online multiplayer games — we get that,” the developer said. “Mandatory global wipes have some obvious benefits: heavily invested players get to re-experience the initial grind once again and, for a time, the playing field is levelled. The optional Expedition Project is our solution to some of the problems that inevitably arise with mandatory wipes — specifically, by respecting your time investment in the game. We want to offer you the choice:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Not completed as much as you’d like? Keep on raiding, building, and growing. Ready for a new challenge and to grind once again? Depart on the Expedition, and receive buffs, rewards, and bragging rights.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arc Raiders Cold Snap update release times:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark Studios launches Cold Snap on Tuesday, December 16, at 10.30am CET / 9.30am UK time / 1.30am PT / 4.30am ET. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cold Snap includes limited-time events and elements running from Tuesday, December 16 until Tuesday, January 13, 2026 at 10.30am CET / 9.30am UK time / 1.30am PT / 4.30am ET. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cold Snap is the last update listed as part of Arc Raiders' 2025 content roadmap, and Embark has yet to outline what's coming in 2026. Arc Raiders sold over 4 million copies worldwide within two weeks of launch, cementing its commercial success. Nexon also revealed that the extraction shooter had reached <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-officially-a-hit-with-over-4-million-copies-sold-and-a-peak-concurrent-player-count-of-700000-across-all-platforms"><u>a huge concurrent count of 700,000 players across all platforms</u></a>.

Cementing its success, Arc Raiders won Best Multiplayer at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">last week’s The Game Awards</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-review"><u>Arc Raiders review</u></a>, returned a 9/10.
