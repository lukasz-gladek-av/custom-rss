For those keeping an eye on the calendar, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-predictions-and-latest-news">big sale event kicks off next week on November 28</a>, but there are already plenty of great deals to look through. This is especially true of video games, with select releases seeing some nice discounts so far. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> is among them at Amazon, as it's hit a new low price for <a href="https://zdcs.link/aM8yw0?object_uuid=518d2290-4880-4c1d-a5fe-85d2c3243e26&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0FDBL8L41" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqRM5y?object_uuid=518d2290-4880-4c1d-a5fe-85d2c3243e26&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0FDBLDXN6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X</a>, and even preorders on <a href="https://zdcs.link/911Anx?object_uuid=518d2290-4880-4c1d-a5fe-85d2c3243e26&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0FKNLSFK8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Borderlands 4 Hits a New Low Price</h2><div id="230607" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="d8e5b00d-31c6-4691-9899-29733bcac716"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Borderlands 4 - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><div id="230608" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="d8e5b00d-31c6-4691-9899-29733bcac716"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Borderlands 4 - Xbox Series X</h3></p></div><div catalogid="d8e5b00d-31c6-4691-9899-29733bcac716" id="230609"><div id="230609" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Borderlands 4 - Nintendo Switch 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">According to price tracker camelcamelcamel, this is the lowest price yet for the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0FDBL8L41" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0FDBLDXN6" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Series X</a> versions of Borderlands 4. It's also a first-time price drop for the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0FKNLSFK8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Switch 2 preorders</a>, which is worth taking advantage of if you've been looking to own it for the handheld. It's worth keeping in mind that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/while-battling-performance-problems-on-pc-xbox-and-playstation-gearbox-delays-borderlands-4-on-nintendo-switch-2-just-a-week-before-launch-and-cancels-all-digital-pre-orders">Switch 2 version has been delayed indefinitely</a>, but this will still secure you a copy for when it's ready.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We were big fans of Borderlands 4. In our 8/10 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-review">review</a>, writer Travis Northup said it's "a badass open-world evolution of a wonderfully unhinged looter-shooter series that needed to try something new, and it largely nails the biggest swings it takes. Combat is slicker than ever thanks to exciting new movement options and some interesting enemy designs, and the entertaining story takes things in a fresh direction while still tying neatly into existing lore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This deal is just the beginning. There's so much more to come as we get closer to Black Friday, especially when it comes to video game deals.
