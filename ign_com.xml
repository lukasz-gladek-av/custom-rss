The latest is a series that dates back to the 1990s, Dynasty Warrior: Origins is a good starting point for newcomers, because it effectively reboots the series.

You can try a demo of the game for free.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Dynasty Warriors: Origins?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Dynasty Warriors: Origins is a hack-and-slash game that features a new “nameless hero” protagonist, which is meant to act as an on-ramp for anyone who’s never tried the series before. This installment is billed as having “the most exhilarating action in the series' history,” Dynasty Warriors: Origins also harnesses the power of modern gaming hardware to pit your character against the most onscreen enemies ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you want to know why it’s so good, in IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dynasty-warriors-origins-review">Dynasty Warriors: Origins review</a>, critic Jada Griffin wrote:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If Dynasty Warriors: Origins is meant to be a new beginning, it’s one that gets off to a masterful start. It doesn’t just have the largest amount of enemies the series has thrown on screen at once, it also deepens its combat, improves its storytelling without getting in the way of the action, and provides a healthy amount of replayability and postgame content – all while looking better than ever. Your amnesiac hero is a bit too much of a blank slate at times, but the impressive ensemble cast made this story sing as I grew to care about the characters around him, big and small. Origins is both a great entry point for newcomers and a triumphant return for veterans like me who felt the last few entries had become stale or missed the mark. It feels like the series I once loved is finally back. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-capcom-fighting-collection-2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sid-meiers-civilization-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Sid Meier's Civilization VII Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-up-for-preorder">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dynasty-warriors-origins-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Dynasty Warriors: Origins Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-suikoden-i-ii-hd-remaster">Suikoden 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

But the story ain't over yet. Stay tuned.

Rather, it’s a brand new game, something Larian was keen to move on to after trying and failing to spark enthusiasm internally for a Baldur's Gate follow-up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In November 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-teases-next-big-game-as-xbox-announcement-nears"><u>Vincke spoke in vague terms about the studio’s next project</u></a>. “I wish I could tell you about our next big game but this is really encouraging us to ensure it pushes many boundaries,” Vincke teased in response to Baldur’s Gate 3’s many The Game Awards nominations. “I’m very excited about it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July 2023, ahead of Baldur’s Gate 3’s explosive launch, Vincke told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-developer-larian-will-definitely-make-a-divinity-original-sin-sequel-but-not-before-a-well-earned-break"><u>a sequel to Larian’s own Divinity: Original Sin series is on the cards</u></a> too, although fans shouldn’t hold their breath.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's our own universe we built, so we're definitely gonna get back there at some point,” Vincke said. “We will get back there at some point. We'll first finish [Baldur's Gate 3], and then take a break, because we will need to refresh ourselves creatively also. You’re seeing 400 developers putting their heart and souls into this. You’re getting the best of them and their craft into this game. And so I can tell you, it's quite a thing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If Divinity isn’t next, perhaps a brand new game set in a completely different universe? Larian has created fantasy RPGs for some time now. Could it branch out into science fiction? Or a modern day setting? Or maybe even try a new genre?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It feels like it may be some time — years even — before we find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
