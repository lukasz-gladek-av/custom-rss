A remake of the 2004 JRPG The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, this new version follows the same adventure led by Joshua and Estelle, but with 3D graphics, new gameplay mechanics, and more quality of life improvements. You can preorder the game now at a variety of retailers (<a href="https://zdcs.link/9gb1wn?object_uuid=d322f80e-b065-4000-bd5a-9ce4369dfd33&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>). Read on for buy links, pricing info, and more.</p><p id="where-to-preorder"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to preorder">Preorder Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</h2></p><p id="what-is-this-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What is this game?">What Is Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter?</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/trails-blogroll-1747145991972.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The original game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/04/04/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky-review">The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky</a>, first released in Japan in 2004. It didn’t make its way to the West until 2011, when it came out here for PlayStation Portable. The game has two direct sequels, Trails in the Sky SC and Trails in the Sky the 3rd. The overarching Legend of Heroes series spans much more time, with entries releasing between the 1980s and now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is a remake of the first entry in this sub-series. In it, you play as Estelle and Joshua, two Bracers-in-training who travel around the world, helping people in order to earn full Bracer status. The main overarching storyline revolves around the mystery of what happened to Estelle’s father, who has gone missing. The game is known for its many characters and many lines of dialogue. It’s sort of a relaxed, slow moving, hang-out game that verges on visual novel territory at times. It’s great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead of the PS1-style sprite-based graphics of the original, this remake features full 3D anime-style graphics that look basically like the Tales or Dragon Quest games. It looks pretty great, especially since the story of the original is so good. It will be nice to experience it with a more modern presentation. The original game is still available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3375780/Trails_in_the_Sky_1st_Chapter/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>.</p><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">Other Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster-nintendo-switch-2">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-capcom-fighting-collection-2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Ghost of Yotei Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-up-for-preorder">Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-legend-zelda-breath-wild-nintendo-switch-2">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-legend-zelda-tears-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-where-to-preorder">Mafia: The Old Country Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition-switch-2">Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-super-mario-party-jamboree-jamboree-tv-nintendo-switch-2">Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-pc">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

Not in real life, mind you, but in-game. And while it sounds like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>'s director is fishing for it, there hasn't been a bit on the line from Waffle House.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1922122520406458818" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>, Tekken game director Katsuhiro Harada was responding to fans still eagerly asking for a Waffle House stage in Tekken 8. It's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-director-responds-to-the-many-fans-asking-for-a-waffle-house-level">a frequent demand</a> that's gained a lot of steam as Harada himself has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-director-katsuhiro-harada-has-more-questions-about-waffle-house">expressed interest in learning more on the matter</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Harada said he "fully understands" fans' requests. So much so, in fact, that he's already been thinking about it, and apparently taken action to try and make something happen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Over the past year or more, I've actually tried to make contact through several different channels," said Harada on X/Twitter. "However, and this is purely my own speculation, I suspect that the lack of response may be due to the fact that the project I'm known for revolves around 'fighting-themed video games.'"</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>To be honest, within the bounds of what I can say, I fully understand your (you guys) request—that's precisely why I had considered taking on this challenge. In fact, I had already been thinking about it quite a while ago.</p><p>Over the past year or more, I've actually tried to make… <a href="https://t.co/Sa5oSpk2IZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Sa5oSpk2IZ</a></p></div>— Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1922122520406458818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Harada noted that "no response" equals a very rare case. He also said if using a different name or format is acceptable, as long as "the core message is maintained," then he would be willing to seriously reconsider and explore this again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it seems like Kazuya and Jin won't be settling their familial differences beneath the yellow light of a Waffle House sign anytime soon. A parody version could happen though, or an in-universe facsimile. Harada <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1922113179674345512" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested "Hustle House" in another post</a>, which isn't a bad option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tekken 8 is currently swinging into a new update with <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/tekken-8-patch-notes-v2-01" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patch 2.01</a>, after confirming the <a href="https://x.com/TEKKEN/status/1921383478433665449" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impending addition of Fahkumram</a> to the Tekken 8 roster. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-boss-katsuhiro-harada-says-dev-team-working-around-the-clock-to-improve-tekken-8-amid-backlash-emergency-patch-planned">Back in April</a>, Harada responded to fan frustration over Tekken 8's Season 2, and said the tuning team is working "around the clock" to read feedback and work on future changes for the better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It went on to become a Bethesda tradition <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-players-show-off-its-physics-playground-by-playing-dominoes-with-books-and-sandwiches">that was continued with 2023’s Starfield and its more advanced physics</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, that tradition lives on, with one player spending seven hours lining up books to get the Dominoes chain reaction just right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/1kl8pfa/someone_stole_my_video_and_uploaded_it_without/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor Muaxh03</a> uploaded the video below showing their work. We see the books slowly fall and knock the following book in a satisfying fashion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Muaxh03 said they did not use mods to place the books, rather placed them one by one, which sounds particularly grueling. They admit to spawning the books, however. The entire process took seven hours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“... almost every time I loaded the save something broke, it was not reliable so yes I had to deal with books falling or glitching most of the time, that's why you can see some desynchronizing on the books, some fall slower or faster,” Muaxh03 explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NPCs were disabled, of course: “I would lose my mind if there was NPCs walking around,” Muaxh03 said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this effort is a good start for Oblivion Remastered Dominoes, previous efforts in past Bethesda games were more elaborate and involved varied objects. But playing around with books in Oblivion, even Oblivion Remastered, is a lot harder than you might think because you can’t rotate and place objects in Oblivion in the same way you can in Starfield or Skyrim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I spent the first 1-2 hours trying to learn how to place them good, after that the stairs took 2-3 hours because every time I tested it, it gave me different results, every time I loaded the save something broke,” Muaxh03 said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction from Oblivion players has been universally positive, with a mix of disbelief at the time, effort, and patience that went into placing the books so precisely in a game as fiddly as Oblivion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What next? “Cool now fill a bookcase!” joked one player. “I would sooner fight a god in hand-to-hand combat unarmed. Last time I tried to put a book back the whole room ended up in shambles — SHAMBLES!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology. The changes are going down well with fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake"><u>some of whom believe Oblivion Remastered would be more accurately described as a remake</u></a>.
