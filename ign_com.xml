That alone would be enough to carry today’s lineup, but the rest of the deals aren’t slacking either. TVs from LG and Insignia are seeing big discounts, and Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Ultra Titanium is finally priced like it wants to be on someone’s wrist instead of a museum pedestal.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Surging Sparks Booster Bundle Is In Stock Now</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a stacked Humble Bundle full of family-friendly games (yes, Bluey made the cut), and the IGN Store has a highly detailed Death Stranding 2 model kit up for pre-order if your shelf is looking a little too normal. If you’ve got the itch to treat yourself, today’s not a bad day to scratch it.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-surg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surg">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217967"><div id="217967" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t need six booster packs, but these are usually in and out of stock. This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-booster-bundles-back-in-stock-amazon-spring-sale">Surging Sparks</a> Booster Bundle has some fantastic chase cards, we're talking $400+ chase cards that could be in this Booster Bundle. It’s under $50, which in Pokémon terms is basically a clearance sticker. I'm not saying it'll change your life, but it might improve your afternoon.</p></div><p id="insignia-55"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Insignia - 55" f30="" series="" led="">Insignia - 55" Class F30 Series LED 4K UHD Smart Fire TV</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217968"><div id="217968" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Insignia - 55" Class F30 Series LED 4K UHD Smart Fire TV</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the TV I’d buy if I wanted something that works without having to pretend I care about specs. It turns on, the picture’s 4K, it has Alexa so I don’t have to get off the couch, and it costs less than my last grocery run. Honestly, that’s more than enough.</p></div><p id="outright-games-game-on-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Outright Games Game On! Bundle">Outright Games Game On!

Pay $20 or more, get a pile of games, and support charity. Seems like a win for everyone except your free time.</p></div><p id="insignia-65"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Insignia - 65" f50="" series="" led="">Insignia - 65" Class F50 Series LED 4K UHD Smart Fire TV</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217969"><div id="217969" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Insignia - 65" Class F50 Series LED 4K UHD Smart Fire TV</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I like this one because it feels unnecessarily large in the best way. You get Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and it still costs less than a concert ticket and a hoodie. If you want to make movie night feel intentional without spending your life savings, this does the job.</p></div><p id="death-stranding-2-dhv-magellan-m"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Death Stranding 2 - DHV Magellan - M">Death Stranding 2 - DHV Magellan - Model Kit</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217973"><div id="217973" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Death Stranding 2 - DHV Magellan - Model Kit</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I want this on my shelf mostly so people ask what it is and I can pretend I understand <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2</a>. It’s a 1/350 scale model of a massive mobile base from a game that hasn’t even released yet, and I respect the level of commitment required to care this much. It’s $69.99, which is fair for something this weirdly specific and detailed — and yes, the railgun is included.</p></div><p id="lg-65-class-ut70-series-led-4k-uh"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="LG - 65” Class UT70 Series LED 4K UH">LG - 65” Class UT70 Series LED 4K UHD Smart webOS TV (2024)</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217970"><div id="217970" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LG - 65” Class UT70 Series LED 4K UHD Smart webOS TV (2024)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the kind of TV I’d get if I wanted it to last longer than my attention span. It’s a 2024 model, has LG’s updated processor, and handles all the streaming stuff without having to download three extra apps just to log in. Feels like someone at LG actually thought it through.</p></div><p id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-titaniu"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Samsung - Galaxy Watch Ultra Titaniu">Samsung - Galaxy Watch Ultra Titanium Smartwatch 47mm LTE</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217971"><div id="217971" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Samsung - Galaxy Watch Ultra Titanium Smartwatch 47mm LTE</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this is what happens when Samsung realizes not everyone wants to spend $650 to track their steps. The titanium build is overkill in a good way, and the battery life means I don’t have to charge it every time I blink. It finally dropped to a price where it makes sense to buy one without feeling like I’m auditioning for a tech influencer role.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violetjourne"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journe">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217878"><div id="217878" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">i’ve been watching the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">Journey Together</a> Elite Trainer Box like a hawk, and somehow it’s actually in stock at Amazon for $70.31. That’s 30% off apparantly, but it's not at all. It includes nine booster packs, a full-art N’s Zorua promo, sleeves, and the usual accessories, Most people just want the packs and the promo. If it’s gone when you check, keep trying. I’ve seen stock randomly reappear in the mornings and lunch time, just like <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3RDlq?object_uuid=c37b4d1b-d6b0-4f69-a7db-8c4f4a75a646&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target's Journey Together stock</a>.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violetpaldea"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Paldea">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Paldean Fates Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217879"><div id="217879" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Paldean Fates Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the Paldean Fates Booster Bundle at $69.77. Six packs inside, and the draw here is the return of shiny Pokémon. I like that it cuts straight to the good stuff — no sleeves, no dice, no cardboard fluff, just a clean bundle of packs ready to be cracked open. If you’re chasing shinies, this is where the hunt begins.</p></div><p id="best-of-boomer-shooters-4-badda-bin"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best of Boomer Shooters 4: Badda Bin">Best of Boomer Shooters 4: Badda Bing Badda Boom</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217880"><div id="217880" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Best of Boomer Shooters 4: Badda Bing Badda Boom</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charities The Global FoodBanking Network (GFN) + Cool Effect</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Humble Bundle’s “Best of Boomer Shooters 4” is live right now, and I love how chaotic it is. For $16, you get $174 worth of retro-inspired FPS games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/turbo-overkill">Turbo Overkill</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/forgive-me-father-2">Forgive Me Father 2</a>. I think of it as therapy, just with more blood and less talking about my feelings. You also support some good causes, so now your nostalgia trip is technically altruism. You're welcome.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-shro"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shro">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217881"><div id="217881" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-shrouded-fable-preview">Shrouded Fable</a> ETB is holding steady at $54.96, and I think it’s slept on. It has nine packs, a Pecharunt foil, some sharp sleeves, and a player’s guide that you’ll absolutely ignore until you pull something weird and have to look it up. This set's all about the Legendary trio—Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti—and if you’re into building themed decks or hoarding off-meta cards, this one hits.</p></div><p id="street-fighter-alpha-warriors-dreams"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Street Fighter Alpha Warriors Dreams">Street Fighter TCG Alpha Warriors Dreams Preorder</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217882"><div id="217882" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Street Fighter Alpha Warriors Dreams - Series One</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Collectors box, Inner Case and Master Case available for pre order</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, if your card obsession extends beyond Pikachu, the Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors’ Dreams trading cards are now up for pre-order on the IGN Store, starting at $20. I already pre-ordered a box because the idea of serial-numbered Chun-Li cards is somehow more exciting to me than it should be. Rare pulls, killer art, and a chance to relive the 90s one Hadouken at a time — I’m in.</p></div><p id="pokmontcg-paradox-clash-tin-iron"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="PokémonTCG: Paradox Clash tin: Iron ">Pokémon TCG: Paradox Clash tin: Iron Leaves ex or Walking Wake ex</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217883"><div id="217883" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PokémonTCG: Paradox Clash tin: Iron Leaves ex or Walking Wake ex</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up one of the Paradox Clash tins just for fun and honestly, no regrets. For $39.96, you get five booster packs and either a Walking Wake EX or Iron Leaves EX promo, chosen completely at random. It’s a bit of a gamble, but opening tins is half the fun anyway. The promos are clean, the packaging is slick, and I think it makes a solid gift for anyone getting into the game</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-3-booster-packs-1-ran"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: 3 Booster Packs &amp; 1 Ran">Pokémon TCG: 3 Booster Packs &amp; 1 Random Foil</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217884"><div id="217884" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: 3 Booster Packs &amp; 1 Random Foil</h3></p></div><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>For a cheaper fix, I’d go for the $12.25 blister pack with three random boosters and a foil promo. It’s 39% off, which is honestly kind of wild, and it’s one of those no-risk purchases you can talk yourself into without too much guilt. The listing shows Silver Tempest Boosters, so there's a good chance of pulling some Sword and Shield chase cards here.</p><p>This one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-pc-players-who-do-not-cheat-are-being-penalized-by-new-console-only-crossplay-option-for-regular-multiplayer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With the launch of Season 3 this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone get a significant change that some within the PC community have said could hit their matchmaking queue times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision published the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-3-patch-notes-are-here">Season 3 patch notes</a> and with it confirmed a big change coming to regular Multiplayer. It’s separating the Multiplayer Ranked Play and Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play settings and adding a new Multiplayer-only setting for Quickplay, Featured, and Party Games matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of these three settings (Multiplayer Ranked Play, Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play, and Multiplayer Unranked) will include the following crossplay options when Season 3 goes live on April 4:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>On: Enables matchmaking with all gaming platforms when playing in the selected playlists.</li><li>On (Consoles Only): Enables matchmaking only with other consoles when playing in selected playlists.</li><li>Off: Restricts matchmaking to your current gaming platform only in selected playlists.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision made a point of warning those who select 'On (Consoles Only)' <em>may</em> experience negatively impacted matchmaking queue times. But Activision outright said 'Off' <em>will </em>negatively impact matchmaking queue times.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the console-only crossplay coming to regular Multiplayer that has some within the Call of Duty PC community spooked. They’ve said that console players having the option to essentially strip out matchmaking with PC players for regular Multiplayer may mean longer queue times for them, and you can see why they’d be worried.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty has a reputation for cheating (it comes with the territory of being such a hugely popular shooter and having a free-to-download battle royale). Cheating is more prevalent on PC (Activision recently confirmed as much, to the point where it said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-console-players-unlikely-to-be-cheating-theyre-just-killing-you-with-an-intel-advantage-activision-says">if you believe you’ve died unfairly to a console player, it’s much more likely that they’ve used ‘intel advantage’ than cheats</a>). So, some console players head straight into Call of Duty’s settings and turn off crossplay across the board, just to take the potential for PC cheaters ruining their day out of the equation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a PC player…. hate this change but I get it,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1job9jr/comment/mkqf7p7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor exjr_ said</a>. “I hope it doesn’t affect queue times for the game in the long-run so I’m not forced to buy the game on PS5 to have a good experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is awful for PC players because this just killed PC,” <a href="https://x.com/GKeepnclassy/status/1906786971831435531" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added X / Twitter user @GKeepnclassy</a>. “Terrible idea because now PC players that ARE NOT cheating are being penalized. This is bullshit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"My lobbies barely fill already to being with on PC due to sbmm," said @CBBMack. "This will withought a doubt make it worse. Time to plug in the console I guess."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some PC players have reacted angrily to the change, saying Activision should instead do more to make its anti-cheat more effective so console players aren’t driven to turn crossplay off in the first place. “Maybe they should fix their anti-cheat instead of isolating PC players,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1job9jr/comment/mkqgqcu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor MailConsistent1344 commented</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision, as IGN has reported, has spent millions of dollars in the battle against Call of Duty cheat makers, cheat sellers, and cheat users, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name"><u>a number of recent high-profile successes</u></a>. Earlier in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prolific-call-of-duty-cheat-developer-insists-its-shutting-down-but-players-are-skeptical"><u>Phantom Overlay announced it was shutting down</u></a>, with fans reacting in disbelief that such a prominent Call of Duty cheat provider would fall by the wayside. And just last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/4-call-of-duty-cheat-providers-shut-down-in-apparent-sweep-and-clear-operation-ahead-of-verdansks-return-to-warzone">IGN reported on four cheat providers that were shut down</a> ahead of next week’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-release-date-for-return-of-original-verdansk-map-to-call-of-duty-warzone"><u>hotly anticipated return of Verdansk to Warzone</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it is an uphill battle that may be impossible to win. Activision has promised improved anti-cheat tech with the launch of Season 3, so it will be interesting to see if PC players feel any changes there, especially with the influx of players <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-returns-to-call-of-duty-warzone-here-are-all-the-biggest-changes">the return of Verdansk</a> will bring to Warzone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, as many have pointed out, the ultra mainstream, super casual Call of Duty audience on console may never make use of these new crossplay settings because they may simply not be aware of them. Most Call of Duty players likely do not fuss over patch notes or spend much time in the settings. They jump into unranked Multiplayer, have some fun for an hour or two, then leave. These players may never know console-only crossplay is an option, or know why it would be needed in the first place. And so, the majority of console players may continue to play Call of Duty as they’ve always done: with full crossplay on by default.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a point made by Call of Duty YouTuber TheXclusiveAce, who reacted to PC player concern in a post on <a href="https://x.com/TheXclusiveAce/status/1906804429992730990" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I see a lot of pushback with this change from PC players concerned that they won't be able to find games in lesser played modes or that matchmaking will take too long,” TheXclusiveAce said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To be clear, PC players will still be matchmaking with the largest pool of the playerbase since that majority of players won't even notice this setting exists so they'll stick to the default or even if they are aware of it, many will choose to leave it on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If anything, it's the players that decide to turn console-only crossplay on that will be limiting their matchmaking pool but that's a choice that's now in their hands for the first time in Pubs and it's a tradeoff that many of us will be happy to make.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Season 3 nearly upon Black Ops 6 and Warzone, it will be interesting to see if these changes move the needle, as Activision’s war on cheaters continues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

In 2025, finding <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-finally-solves-pokemon-tcg-shortage">Pokémon cards at their intended price</a> feels like spotting a shiny on the first encounter. It’s rare. It’s thrilling. And honestly, I want more.</p><div catalogid="742e33a5-5065-4a10-982e-245f6afb5290" id="217961"><div id="217961" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Available again directly from Amazon at the current MSRP.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle includes six booster packs from the latest Surging Sparks expansion. If you’re into Electric-types or just want an excuse to hear foil crackle between your fingers, I think this is it. The new card art looks great, there are some intriguing new Trainer strategies in the mix, and opening packs still hits the same dopamine receptors it did in 1999. 
</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">My Favorite Surging Sparks Chase Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Surging Sparks has some unreal chase cards, making a massive shift in art quallity in the Scarlet and Violet era. The Special Illustration Rare Pikachu ex is going for around $430, and Latias ex is even higher at nearly $500. Milotic ex is another banger at about $150 thanks to an ability that blocks damage from Tera Pokémon. Hydreigon ex is strong too, with a deck-discarding attack that’s super viable for play. Even the Hyper Rare Pikachu ex holds value at around $120. I don’t expect to pull any of these, but the odds keep things interesting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, this is the kind of deal that’s perfect for casual collectors like me, or anyone who enjoys the chaos of pulling something rare right after saying, “Just one more pack.” I know better than to promise a Pikachu EX SIR in every box, but I’ll absolutely take my chances when I don’t have to pay a third-party markup for the privilege.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re building a deck, feeding a binder addiction, or just gifting this to a kid so you can secretly open the packs yourself later, this is your chance. No inflated prices. No shady listings. Just six legit booster packs that actually ship from Amazon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I already added one to my cart. I’m pretending it’s “for research.” You can decide your own excuse.
