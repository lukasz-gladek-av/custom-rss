Drivers can “race to stop at designated platforms,” and are “scored on their ability to handle their train with precision and control under pressure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metro Rivals: New York’s first trailer was revealed as part of IGN Fan Fest and, as you can see in the player at the top of the page, gives a brief glimpse into train racing mechanics. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metro Rivals: New York Trailer Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Dovetail, the game’s narrative sees “players begin their journey with nothing but a hand-me-down train and a determination to rise. To succeed, they must take on a variety of missions, earn cash fares, upgrade their train’s performance, build a loyal following, and earn respect.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there will be in-game purchases, Dovetail says those are “entirely cosmetic” and that the game is not “pay-to-win.” Instead, players “can express themselves with extensive options to upgrade their train’s performance, apply unique skins and liveries in signature colours, and personalise their character’s appearance to stand out on the tracks.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if neither the single player campaign nor the PvP mode is your cup of tea, you also have the option to partake in a “more relaxed experience” where “players can set their own paths, hop into their train, and enjoy the sights of the city.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/11/screenshot-2025-10-11-at-4-46-46-pm-1760216249699.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Metro Rivals: New York will be available on Steam, the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in early 2026. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Metro Rivals: New York marks Dovetail’s first use of Unreal Engine 5 in the development process. They also collaborated with the team at Reactional Music to utilize a procedural music engine, meaning that “music is fully native and cinematically integrated in the game, even when swapping tracks.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metro Rivals: New York is being developed for Steam, the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S and is available for wishlisting now.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/metro-rivals-new-york-dovetails-new-train-simcade-game-announced-ign-fall-fan-fest-2025]]></content:encoded>

The video’s tone rides a line between Borderlands and Fallout, as the player’s chosen Earth Directorate agent can be seen wielding everything from explosive rocket launchers and melee tools to Spacer’s Choice-branded rifles featuring their lunar mascot, Moon Man.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of The Outer Worlds 2’s colorful guns has unique properties that will no doubt aid players on their journey through the space colony of Arcadia. We probably don’t need to explain why a buzzsaw mounted on the end of a staff or wrist-mounted gun might come in handy, but the trailer does a good job of showing off how different weapons can be used. Other highlights from the footage include a lime-green acid gun that melts bodies, alien pistols, and even environmental hazards like a ceiling-mounted turret.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another star of the new The Outer Worlds 2 trailer is the different factions, which can be found across a variety of locations that look like they were ripped straight out of the all-time great sci-fi stories. It’s a jam-packed teaser ahead of launch, and it’s undeniably Obsidian.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Outer Worlds 2 has a release date of October 29, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S.

At the time, IGN’s Matt Purslow said, “While I appreciated Obsidian’s prior attempt at this universe, I never totally fell for it, but what the studio has achieved here in this prologue is exactly what I’d hoped for the first time around.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Outer Worlds 2 - Golden Ridge Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, you can read <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-ign-live-2025"><u>our interview with Obsidian VP of operations Marcus Morgan</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Dan Trachtenberg’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/predator-badlands">Predator: Badlands</a> was inspired by a number of video games. The director has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/predator-badlands-director-confirms-death-planet-name-the-new-predators-name-and-reveals-inspiration-from-shadow-of-the-colossus">2005 PlayStation masterpiece Shadow of the Colossus inspired the relationship between the film’s young Predator, called Dek, and Elle Fanning’s character, a Weyland-Yutani synth he must carry around</a>. Now, add World of Warcraft to the mix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You wouldn’t think Blizzard’s massively multiplayer fantasy online role-playing game would have much in common with a new Predator movie. But Trachtenberg, who already has Predator films Prey and Killer of Killers under his belt, told IGN at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/fanfest">Fan Fest 2025: Fall Edition</a> that he took inspiration from one class in particular when it came to Dek’s arsenal of weapons.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">How to Watch the Predator Movies in Chronological Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“He starts out with a number of really cool gadgets,” Trachtenberg said of Dek’s weaponry. “I’ve always felt like there’s a link between the Predator franchise and James Bond. Part of what we enjoy about going to see it is like, what kind of gizmos does he have? And I’ve been stuck in the past with my entries into the franchise, with Prey set in the 1700s and Killer of Killers set in multiple different decades. But all in the past, so I’ve always had to think, what would his weaponry be if it was a little bit more pre what we’re used to seeing? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now I’m well into the future. So he’s got laser bows, has an awesome laser sword that has multiple modes. His sword that he uses, he holds like a classic knight or samurai would, but then it switches it into a different mode and he can use it almost like a glaive.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s the glaive mode of Dek’s new laser sword that was inspired by a weapon in World of Warcraft, which Trachtenberg told us he plays a lot. If you’re familiar with WoW, you’ll know the Demon Hunter class well, and you’ll no doubt have seen its iconic warglaive, perhaps wielded by fan-favorite Demon Hunter Illidan Stormrage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In fact the inspiration initially for that was… I play a lot of WoW, and the Demon Hunters glaive weapon was what sparked that,” Trachtenberg confirmed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the most recent Predator: Badlands trailer, we see Dek use his laser sword in fights against a number of monsters, the ‘Death Planet’ itself, and other Yautja. But it’s interesting to note Trachtenberg’s words in his interview with IGN: “He starts out with a number of really cool gadgets.” Could Dek end up losing his powerful weaponry, Metroid style, over the course of the movie?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, it emerged that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/predator-badlands-is-confirmed-pg-13-rather-than-r-rated-and-fans-of-the-famously-violent-franchise-certainly-have-opinions-about-that">Predator: Badlands won’t be R-rated</a>. But, its creators hope, it will feel like an R regardless. And last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/predator-badlands-director-confirms-theres-no-xenomorph-in-this-movie-so-the-aliens-vs-predator-rematch-is-going-to-have-to-wait"><u>Trachtenberg said fans shouldn’t expect to see a Xenomorph from the Alien franchise in Predator: Badlands</u></a>, despite evil megacorp Weyland-Yutani featuring prominently in the movie’s trailers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Predator: Badlands hits theaters November 7, 2025.
