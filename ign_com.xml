            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft’s announcement that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> is coming to PlayStation is the final nail in the coffin for the Xbox exclusive, and for some marks the end of the console wars. Now, the White House has waded in with an AI image of Donald Trump as a saluting Master Chief that, well… there’s something very wrong about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the uninitiated, Halo: Campaign Evolved, a remake of the campaign of 2001’s Halo: Combat Evolved, is due out on Xbox Series X and S, PC, and PlayStation 5 at some point in 2026. It is the first Halo game ever to launch on a PlayStation console, and cements Microsoft’s position as a multiplatform video game developer.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/27/gettyimages-2243034518-1761563035733.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The White House has released an AI image of Donald Trump as Master Chief. Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea of a Halo game on a PlayStation console would have been outrageous before, say, a few years ago, when Microsoft’s multiplatform push began (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-has-reportedly-pushed-xbox-studios-to-deliver-a-30-profit-margin-allegedly-leading-to-all-those-layoffs-canceled-projects-price-rises-and-the-end-of-exclusives">reportedly in part due to a need to make an increased profit margin from Xbox studios</a>). Perhaps that’s what prompted U.S. video game shop GameStop to tweet a statement declaring the consoles wars over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Someone somewhere within the bowels of the White House saw that tweet and decided it would be a good one to jump on. The tweet in question shows the U.S. president as Halo protagonist Master Chief — clearly generated by AI — holding an Energy Sword and saluting in front of the White House and the American Flag.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Power to the Players <a href="https://t.co/GqNu0qdgmw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/GqNu0qdgmw</a> <a href="https://t.co/4Hw6G7i7aW" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/4Hw6G7i7aW</a></p>— The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1982638578913206632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">But look closely at that flag and you’ll see the mistake — there are 40 stars when there should be 50. Has Trump, as Master Chief, teased plans to scrub 10 states from the U.S. map? Did the AI powering the creation of this image hint at generative AI’s endgame? Should we be worried?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is Trump claiming a key role in ending the console wars? Is the White House making a play for the gamer crowd here? It’s hard to say what this image is trying to achieve, but it has gone well and truly viral, with 9.3 million views at the time of this article’s publication. IGN has asked Microsoft for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an especially odd “collab” from the White House when you consider Trump’s prior comments on video games. In 2019, Trump suggested one way to prevent future mass shootings in America was to take a firm stance against violent video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We must stop the glorification of violence in our society,” he said. “This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace. It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence. We must stop or substantially reduce this and it has to begin immediately.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps, in Trump’s mind, Halo doesn’t count.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Trump administration has form when it comes to using AI images to promote the President. In May, Trump sparked a backlash from some Catholics after posting an AI-generated image of himself as the Pope. The picture, which was shared by official White House social media accounts, was released as Catholics mourned the death of Pope Francis and prepared to choose the next pontiff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The White House has also released AI images of Trump as Superman and as a Star Wars Jedi. And last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this">The Pokémon Company formally responded to the use of Pokémon TV hero Ash Ketchum and the series' theme tune by the Department of Homeland Security</a> as part of a video showing people being arrested and handcuffed by law enforcement agents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Halo: Campaign Evolved, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-for-the-xbox-exclusive-but-in-truth-the-ps5-version-comes-as-no-surprise"><u>why it’s the final nail in the coffin for the Xbox exclusive</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-made-it-right-and-they-are-breaking-it-for-no-reason-one-of-the-key-members-of-the-original-halo-dev-team-doesnt-sound-thrilled-with-microsofts-halo-campaign-evolved">thoughts from some members of the original Halo development team at Bungie</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has finally unveiled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, a remake of the campaign portion of Bungie’s beloved Halo: Combat Evolved. Halo fans have spent most of the weekend debating the changes Halo Studios has made for this upcoming 2026 shooter, from the addition of sprint to the more pristine art style. But what do the developers of Halo: Combat Evolved itself make of the remake?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jaime Griesemer is one of the key developers behind Halo. He was most involved with designing Halo’s famous ‘30 seconds of fun’ gameplay loop and designed much of the campaign itself. Now creative director at Highwire Games (Six Days in Fallujah), <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1981927318752039135" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Griesemer took to X / Twitter</a> to deliver an early verdict on gameplay footage coming out of Microsoft’s Halo: Campaign Evolved reveal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He did not sound impressed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"You aren’t supposed to be able to take the Warthog up to steamroll the Hunters," Griesemer said. "I intentionally placed rocks in the way so you had to fight them on foot. When you can just smash the crates out of the way it wrecks the encounters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But the worst part? They put trees in the landing area of the WooHoo Jump. Lame.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s unpack this a bit. Griesemer is criticizing a key part of the iconic campaign mission, The Silent Cartographer: the first encounter with two Hunters. In the original Halo, this fight is meant to be played with Master Chief on-foot (players soon discovered it was possible to brute force a Warthog into the arena). But in Microsoft’s remake, players can freely take their Warthog up to the Hunters and ride roughshod over their hapless victims. I imagine the Hunters, with their dying breaths, gurgling: “no fair!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(Oh, and that WooHoo Jump? <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982314253072953402" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Griesemer explained</a>: “There’s a ramp that is supposed to have a bunch of jackals at the landing spot. Your gunner would always say ‘Woohoo!’ When you got airborne.”)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Halo: Campaign Evolved – First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say Griesemer’s tweet, viewed 2.3 million times, has sparked a reaction online, with some fans insisting the level layout change ruins the gameplay flow, others saying this change and others like it will make the game more fun. As for Griesemer, in a subsequent tweet, he explained that if Microsoft is going to change Halo’s crates to be dynamic, then they should have also redesigned the encounters that use them as permanent cover."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982259703137829074" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He continued</a>: “Most people forced the Warthog through BECAUSE of the Hunters. The introduction of the Hunters was supposed to be intimidating and difficult, but in the light so you can understand them. Then you meet them in an enclosed dark area and they are even harder. But then you get Rockets and Vehicles and turn the tables. It’s a three act play of enemy design and you want to throw it in a blender. Fine, it’ll go down easier but it’s not going to taste as good.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1981959132082274764" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And</a>: “It’s like the dance remix of a classic song that skips the intro and the bridge and just thumps the chorus over and over.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Griesemer <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982317401426526649" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later offered</a> a potential explanation for this change: “On further analysis I’m sure it’s because the vehicles take damage and so you’re just as likely to destroy the hog as get it over the rocks. If anything that makes it -worse- because -none- of the vehicle tricks are going to work anymore.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">“Make it an option” is the biggest red flag for a dysfunctional design. We have no vision for what this is supposed to be, here’s the tools to fix it yourself.</p>— Jaime Griesemer (@32nds) <a href="https://twitter.com/32nds/status/1981964024511422902?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Another aspect of Halo: Campaign Evolved that Griesemer has taken issue with is the addition of an optional infinite sprint button. Sprint seems to be the biggest talking point about Halo: Campaign Evolved; while you can choose not to sprint, some are saying using it destroys Halo: Combat Evolved’s classic, considered gameplay pace and thus its sense of wonder. Others say believe it’s essential for the fun factor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Griesemer doesn’t sound like a fan of sprinting in the Halo remake, either. In another <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982098938305171538" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, he pointed out that the player was able to sprint into The Silent Cartographer’s shaft vignette so fast that it broke the music transition. “Who is this for?” he asked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then: “If the world isn’t scaled to sprint, you will be able to trivially skip encounters.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo: Campaign Evolved’s Needler, too, has caused quite the kerfuffle. This iconic Halo weapon shoots deadly needles into an enemy, then, after a cool-sounding charge, they explode. The Needler stands out because the ammo — the needles themselves — stick out the top of the gun, so you can easily see how much ammo you have at any given moment. Still, Microsoft saw fit to add an ammo counter on the Needler, just in case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This change has drawn some ridicule online, and Griesemer is clearly not a fan. “By far the most comically unnecessary embellishment in the whole announcement,” <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982161221957660863" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>. "I’m not sure it isn’t intentional satire.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982335105579548762" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Then</a>: “But why would you add an ammo counter to a weapon that IS an ammo counter in the first place?”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">By far the most comically unnecessary embellishment in the whole announcement. I’m not sure it isn’t intentional satire.</p>— Jaime Griesemer (@32nds) <a href="https://twitter.com/32nds/status/1982161221957660863?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In response to Griesemer's original, now viral tweet on Halo: Campaign Evolved, one user accused the veteran designer of “crying” about nostalgia, to which <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982107143923990827" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he responded</a>: “Because I made it right and they are breaking it for no reason.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982116418536788417" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He continued</a>: “... I think there are dozens of changes (reload speeds, no health packs, falling damage, etc) that make the game 'slicker' but ultimately less interesting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Bungie left Halo behind to develop Destiny, Microsoft, via what was known as 343 Industries, continued the franchise with Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and 2021’s Halo: Infinite. The internet would suggest that with these games, Microsoft has struggled to recreate the Bungie “magic,” for want of a better term. Certainly Bungie’s Halo games are more fondly remembered than Microsoft’s. But why has Microsoft struggled so?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Griesemer was asked this question, and in his response revealed his thoughts on the idea of remaking Halo and continuing to make new Halo games now, nearly 25 years after Combat Evolved came out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s not the early 2000s anymore,” <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982101197025919181" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>. “Halo is of its time, maybe more than any other game franchise. So they are constantly trying to either take Halo out of 2001 and modernize it (which breaks it) or take players back to 2001 with nostalgia (which is impossible).”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">“Keep getting them checks.” Remakes and remasters are soul-destroying and I feel for any dev working on one. They can’t win and even if they do they won’t get credit. Bad situation unless you are getting paid $$$.</p>— Jaime Griesemer (@32nds) <a href="https://twitter.com/32nds/status/1981934406303703219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Probably not. But I’m not sure what the point is of a “remake” anyway. Nostalgia? A new generation of fans? Occupying an enormous art team while you figure out what to do?</p>— Jaime Griesemer (@32nds) <a href="https://twitter.com/32nds/status/1981969408525578526?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">They kept the music and the AI the same, it looks like. I’m glad I can play it on a Sony system.</p>— Jaime Griesemer (@32nds) <a href="https://twitter.com/32nds/status/1982264974878839081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 26, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">One member of the original Halo team who sounds thrilled with Halo: Campaign Evolved is Marcus Lehto, who was the art director on Combat Evolved and thus heavily involved in the iconic look of Halo itself. Lehto, who recently left the now shuttered Battlefield 6 developer Ridgeline Games (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-co-creator-marcus-lehto-disappointed-ridgeline-staff-were-not-properly-credited-in-battlefield-6-says-they-built-the-foundation-of-the-game">and hit out at EA for not properly credited former staff</a>), offered a positive assessment of Halo Studios’ work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“My honest impression of seeing the new Halo Campaign Evolved is this," <a href="https://x.com/game_fabricator/status/1982523556320948338" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said on X / Twitter</a>. “I absolutely love where this is going. The game looks and feels genuine. It's gorgeous in a way I wish we could have built it originally back in 2001. It warms my heart to see Halo CE like this.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo: Campaign Evolved isn’t out until 2026 (and probably near to the game’s 25th anniversary in November), so Halo Studios has time to react to some of the feedback it’s seen and make changes — if that’s what it wants to do, of course. It may stick to its guns on the likes of sprint, those rocks, and the Needler's ammo counter. Meanwhile, the Halo community continues to debate the changes, fussing over every detail and what it means for the tone, feel, and gameplay of Bungie’s seminal shooter. I suspect this will be a running theme well into 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Halo: Campaign Evolved, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-for-the-xbox-exclusive-but-in-truth-the-ps5-version-comes-as-no-surprise">why it’s the final nail in the coffin for the Xbox exclusive</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
