Unless you're mega lucky, of course.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">10: Lillie's Clefairy ex - 184/159</h2><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223150"><div id="223150" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lillie's Clefairy ex - 184/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst Lillie's Clefairy ex SIR is considered the main chase card of Journey Together, it's quite affordable now. Due to the overhype surrounding this set and scalpers not being able to get the same astronomical amounts for it, this card soon crashed to around the $150 mark. It's a gorgeous card and a no brainer decision for your binder.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9: Team Rocket's Moltres ex - 229/182</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223151"><div id="223151" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Team Rocket's Moltres ex - 229/182</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">How can anyone not love this card? It's got action, stunning detail and eye popping color that represents the Team Rocket vibe of Destined Rivals perfectly. It's a beast in battle too, with Flame Screen doing 110 damage whilst reducing damage from the opposing Pokémon by 50. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Evil Incineration allows trainers to discard a Team Rocket's Energy in order to immidiately discard an opposing active Pokémon and all attached card. Play this right and it could turn battles on their heads, especially because its a basic Pokémon, so it can be built up straight away on a trainers bench without evolution mechanics getting in the way. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8: Latias ex - 239/191</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223152"><div id="223152" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Latias ex - 239/191</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sharing a dual artwork with <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKgqVj?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Latios Illustration Rare</a>, Latais ex is holding it's value of nearly $200 and is an absolute stunner playing on a sunset background with Latios. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's ability allows you to switch out basic Pokémon to hit swiftly with Eon blade, which does 200 damage and stops it from attacking next turn. All trainers need to do is survive the next turn and switch out with another Pokémon for free. Rinse and repeat, love to see it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7: Roaring Moon ex - 162/131</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223153"><div id="223153" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Roaring Moon ex - 162/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Roaring Moon ex SIR has held it's value out of the gate since Prismatic Evolutions dropped, which is frankly amazing. The linework in this card is ridiculously intricate, giving it that cave painting vibe that goes well with ancient Pokémon found deep in Area Zero, Paldea. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a cool moment too, seeing Roaring Moon seemingly escaping some sort of cosmic calamity. The more you look at it the better it gets.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6: Cynthia's Garchomp ex - 232/182</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223154"><div id="223154" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cynthia's Garchomp ex - 232/182</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm calling Destined Rivals as the best Scarlet and Violet set for it sheer amount of detailed and expresive artwork, and Cynthia's Garchomp ex SIR is a fantastic example of this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With calls to the Pokémon League in the early anime (See the fire lamps at the top of the stadium) and big screen behind trainers on platforms, Garchomp can be seen lunging forward and breaking ground as it goes. Amazing card and well worth the money.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5: Pikachu ex - 238/191</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223035"><div id="223035" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pikachu ex - 238/191</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Current Market Value: $289.86</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Pikachu ex SIR is partially to blame for the Pokémon TCG boom that kicked off at the end of October 2024 and is still going today. After peaking at $485 at the end of 2024, it's finally stabalized at a much for reasonable $295 at the time of writing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a good time to snap it up, if you've got the cash, but the amount of nostalgia and detailed yet soft artwork on this card will make it climb back up as we move away from the Scarlet and Violet era over the years to come. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4: Ethan's Ho-Oh ex - 230/182</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223155"><div id="223155" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ethan's Ho-Oh ex - 230/182</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This was one of my main chase cards from Destined Rivals, just look at it. Not only have we got mental amounts of nostalgia for Pokémon Gold and Silver OGs, but it reminds me so much of the first ever episode of Pokémon when Ho-Oh was revealed for the first time (which was before Pokémon Gold and Silver released). It's a stunning illustration that means so much to plenty of trainers, and I half expected the $300 market value before release.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3: Greninja ex - 214/167</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223034"><div id="223034" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Greninja ex - 214/167</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Current Market Value: $288.31</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Greninja ex SIR is my favorite in this article as I have it graded in a 10 and I'm being completely bias. Joking aside (I'm not) but this is one of the best artworks outside of Prismatic Evolutions in the Scarlet and Violet era. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Twilight Masquerade was a slept on set in my opinion, but the chances of pulling this are stacked. If you have the money upfront, i'd put it into this card instead of trying to rip packs. But I also obviously hate having fun, so the choice is yours.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2: Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex - 231/182 </h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223038"><div id="223038" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex - 231/182 </h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Current Market Value: $378.76</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What a beast of a card! Mewtwo ex SIR captured that Mewtwo's Revenge energy so hard, immense amounts of nostalgia in this card for me. It looks like everyone agrees considering it's currently over $450. Destined Rivals cards are up and down day after day, so no doubt we'll see this settle at a cheaper pricepoint before it crossed the vintage checkpoint in years to come.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1: Umbreon ex - 161/131</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223040"><div id="223040" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Umbreon ex - 161/131</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Current Market Value: $1,162.95</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We always knew it was going to be insanely priced, and we needed a cheaper Umbreon chase card after <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/246723/pokemon-swsh07-evolving-skies-umbreon-vmax-alternate-art-secret?page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Umbreon VMAX (Moonbreon)</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Granted, it's still a mental market price, and over $1,000. But it won't get cheaper solely because it's<a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAxJx?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Umbreon</a> and almost anything linked to this dark type Eeveelution holds it's value, trust me on this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're brave enough to drop $1,000 on Prismatic Eeveelutions boosters, or even this card standalone, I salute your efforts, and your bank account.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions: Even More Eeveelutions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The money in Prismatic Evolution chase cards is insane, and it always will be, which is why the rest of the Eeveelutions need a dedicated section to themselves! These could've dominated the whole article, otherwise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G1yP?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon ex SIR</a> is a stunner, but I always prefer seeing Pokémon cards with a bit of movement and action in them. I have to say though, the ornate ice patterns and overall terastalisation of <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G1yP?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon</a> is dipicted so well. It's also one of the less eye-wateringly expensive Eeveelution cards from Prismatic Evolutions at the minute.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeping up the trend is one of my favorites, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G1yR?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jolteon ex SIR</a> from Prismatic Evolutions. There's been some banger Jolteon Cards in the past, for me that would be <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/264213/pokemon-swsh09-brilliant-stars-trainer-gallery-jolteon?Language=English&amp;page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jolteon from the Brilliant Stars Trainer Gallery</a> and the <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/253418/pokemon-swsh-sword-and-shield-promo-cards-jolteon-v-swsh183?Language=English&amp;page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jolteon V Sword and Shield Promo Card</a>, but this one has unlimited energy. Just look at how expressive this card is, perfectly showcasing Jolteons speed and agility with one of the coolest backgrounds i've seen in a Pokémon card. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cell shading mixed with comic book artstyle of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAxmp?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vaporeon ex SIR</a> from Prismatic Evolutions is a stunner. Just look at how light is captured in every drop of water and crystal. Plus I think this is one of the cutest depictions of this water-type Eeveelution we've had for some time. Absolute banger of a card and would do a flip terribly if I pulled this beast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another beautiful pastel artwork with <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YWM4r?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Espeon ex SIR</a>. On top of Espeon being a fan favorite, it's easy to see why this card is now over $300. I've never seen that many shades of purple in such a small space before, such a stunning piece of art, imagine pulling this, getting a 10 then getting it in your slabbed collection? Stuff of dreams.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I love me a good woodblock print, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8MYX?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leafeon ex SIR</a> gives me massive tradition Japanese art vibes. The bold colours, thick lines and the overall beauty of this makes it worth the price tag.Verdant storm for   a grass and colourless energy can be devestating too, 60 x damage for every energy attached to all of your opponents Pokémon. Lethal!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's such a shame Fairy typing didn't come back for <a href="https://zdcs.link/znx5ej?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sylveon ex SIR</a>, because I can't think of a more Fairy type Pokémon card ever. It's another stunner with a cute stance and a pastel color pallete that just makes it. There's that much pink it just works, a fantastic card and its easy to see why it's over $400, especially as it's one of the most popular Eeveelutions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-is-a-soulslike-with-a-unique-look-and-a-neat-hook<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not going to lie to you, folks. When I hear the word “soulslike,” my eyes start to glaze over, and I imagine the sweet release of death. It’s the same way I feel when someone says “metroidvania,” or “roguelike.” There’s nothing inherently wrong with soulslikes, metroidvanias, or roguelikes, for the record. There’s just an awful lot of them. I love a good steak, but you can’t eat fillet mignon every day. Sometimes you need some sushi, a taco plate, hell, even just a burger. A little variety goes a long way. So when I got asked whether I wanted a one or two-hour appointment with Wuchang, I only signed up for an hour. But I was allowed to play for two, and I’m really, really glad I did. Wuchang may be a soulslike, but it’s got unique ideas, and by the time I put down my controller, I knew I wanted to see more of what it has to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers sets itself apart from the jump with its unique art and setting. It takes place in the land of Shu during the latter part of the Ming Dynasty. That single choice sets what I played of Wuchang apart from just about every other soulslike. Most games in this genre aren’t shy about their dark fantasy aspirations. In theory, that should mean everything looks a little different. In reality, that means most games look like Dark Souls, which means that most games really look like Berserk. I like Berserk, but it’s not great when everything looks like it stepped out of one of Kentaro Miura’s panels. Wuchang’s dark fantasy, make no mistake, but its setting means a lot of what I saw looks and feels unique (and colorful).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The story’s got an interesting setup, too. You play as Wuchang, a pirate with a nasty bout of amnesia. In my demo, she woke up without knowing who she was or what was going on. Unfortunately for her, amnesia might be the least of her problems. You see, Wuchang has contracted a disease known as the Feathering. It starts small; feathers form on your limbs. But as the disease progresses, you lose your memories, go mad, and undergo a “monstrous transformation.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Unlike most other Souls games, you don’t have to equip or spec into magic for it to be useful. It just is.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no known cure, but that doesn’t mean our girl is just going to lie down. She’s healthier than most, so she’s going to look for a cure. The problem is, once most people realize you’ve contracted the Feathering, they’ll attack you on sight. It’s a neat reason for why just about everyone in Wuchang (though not all; there are plenty of people willing to help you) will attack you as soon as they see you. And the Feathering isn’t entirely a curse; it also gives Wuchang access to very powerful magic. Unlike most other Souls games, you don’t have to equip or spec into magic for it to be useful. It just is. That’s pretty slick.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other big thing Wuchang does is make each of its weapons unique. Each one is different in very subtle ways. The greataxe in my demo could block, but parrying was a technique that was essentially reserved for a longsword. Other weapons didn’t have either ability, opting instead for attack skills to lay on the hurt. And you can’t just fire off these skills anytime, either. Using them (aside from block and parry, which you always have provided you’ve equipped a weapon with them) take charges, which you build by pulling off perfect dodges or parries. Nailing perfect dodges and parries also charges your magic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wuchang isn’t quite as fast as Bloodborne, but it’s faster than most souslikes and encourages you to be aggressive to build those charges. The dance is still here against bosses, and you shouldn’t charge in blindly, but Wuchang is less about waiting for enemies to whiff an attack and punishing them and more about forcing them to swing at you, building those charges, and then cashing in for big damage, either through weapon abilities, magic, or attacks that deal damage while switching to your other equipped weapons. It’s a nice change of pace from traditional soulslike, and forces you to take risks to get access to your best stuff.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even leveling up is its own thing. Instead of dumping points into your core stats, you fill out a skill tree for everything from your weapons to upgrading your flasks. If you want specific stats, you’ll get them through the armor you equip. There’s no shortage of outfits in Wuchang, from the traditional to the risqué (and there is no shortage of fanservice in Wuchang), but you’re not just playing Fashion Souls or looking at core stats here. You always want to be sure you’re picking the right resistances. If you’re losing to enemies with swords, you might want some slashing resistance. Getting smashed by a big hammer? Bludgeoning resistance is the way to go. Magic got you down? Get some magic resistance in you. These choices matter, and I appreciate that your gear matters, even if I could have done without some of the fan service.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s no shortage of outfits in Wuchang, from the traditional to the risqué.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are still bonfires (here, they’re shrines) and resting at them, which in Wuchang is known as “entering the Dream,” still respawns any enemies you’ve defeated. Even that, though, isn’t necessarily safe. The first time I entered the dream in my demo, I was attacked by a large, bird-like boss. I lost the fight that followed, but when I went back to the dream, the boss wasn’t there. I couldn’t tell you what the deal with that was, but it was interesting, and I kept wondering when (or if) I would get another shot at him. I didn’t, but I am interested in getting another crack at him and figuring out what all that stuff is about.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of bosses, I did get to square off with three of them during my time with Wuchang, and none of them corresponded to the “Big Dude in Armor” stereotype. From Software got that right with Artorias the Abysswalker, and they (and many others) have leaned on similar versions of that fight since. Often imitated, never duplicated, as the saying goes. Wuchang isn’t interested in sitting down at that table, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, every one felt very different. The first was a masked man with a halberd. He definitely had a range advantage on my longsword and greataxe combo, but that was fine with me. I wanted him to swing at me so I could build charges and then use my greataxe to lay down the law. This boss took me quite a few attempts, mostly because I’d think I had an opening when I really didn’t, and get cooked for trying to attack when it wasn’t actually my turn. Once I got his patterns down, though, I was building charges and spending them efficiently, dodging through his attacks and landing big swings of my own. And when I needed to back off? I could cover myself with magic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The second fight was against someone who seemed to have been transformed by the feathering. This was more acrobatic. The boss would leap into the air and attack from range, forcing me to time my dodges to avoid projectiles and keep from committing until I absolutely had to. I didn’t find it nearly as hard as the first (it took me just s couple tries), but I did appreciate the change of pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last fight… whew, that last fight. Only one person at the entire event beat the final fight in the Wuchang demo, and I’m sad to say it  wasn’t me. While the other two fights were all about dodging, this one (against a woman wielding a sword), forced me to parry. Even with the right weapon and good timing, she was a hard fight: incredibly fast, aggressive, and damaging. Every time I tried to back off to heal, she was in my face. Even when I parried her successfully, I had to be careful; I often only had time for a single counterattack before she’d hit me again. It was a brutal fight, and I didn’t win, but I appreciated how hard it was, and how I’d had to change my strategy for each boss. I can’t wait for another crack at her from the comfort of my couch.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that sums up my feelings with Wuchang as a whole, really. I got a ton of time with it, far more than anything else I played at Summer Game Fest, and I left satisfied with what I’d seen. But I was also excited to see more. Not bad for a souslike, right?</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
