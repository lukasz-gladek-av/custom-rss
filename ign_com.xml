            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deltarune-has-a-hidden-message-on-playstation-for-anyone-who-manages-to-earn-no-trophies-at-all.1216821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-has-a-hidden-message-on-playstation-for-anyone-who-manages-to-earn-no-trophies-at-all<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With Deltarune chapters 3 and 4 out last week, players have been eagerly mining the new episodes for more of Toby Fox's characteristic secrets and mysterious plot threads. In the process, they've found an absolutely fascinating bit of dialogue that's almost impossible to get, as it requires beating all four chapters of Deltarune on PlayStation without earning a single trophy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Warning: While this article won't spoil any of the major plot moments of Deltarune, it will talk in vague terms about some of the more common and low/no-spoiler trophy achievements. If you're someone who doesn't want to know a single piece of information about Deltarune before going in, probably better skip this one!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As shared by Reddit user millsbuddy, there's a special, hidden bit of dialogue that appears in Deltarune Chapter 4's credits sequence if, and only if, the player has completed all four chapters without earning a single trophy. This allegedly checks the player's PSN account, so if you try to get this text, fail by accidentally getting a trophy, delete your file and try again, no luck. You still have the trophy, so it won't appear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is an even more ridiculous task than it sounds on its face, as some of the achievements are so laughably easy to get that you're almost certainly going to get at least a few by accident just through playing normally. There are achievements for taking damage a certain number of times, for using or equiping items, for getting a Game Over, equipping armor, opening too many treasure chests, interacting with chairs, and a lot more. Some achievements have multiple possible triggers. There are also four achievements simply obtained by completing a chapter, but you can avoid getting those by finding a certain secret item in each chapter that will nullify the achievement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trophies were added to Deltarune with the addition of Chapters 3 and 4 last week, but they're PlayStation-exclusive. Fox <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/release-date/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted in a newsletter</a> that this was because trophies were a requirement to shipping a paid game on PlayStation, and alluded to the challenge of finding this special text in his announcement:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were required to have TROPHIES! This time, they give rise to a pretty hard-core challenge. But - and PLEASE listen - I make no endorsement that you actually attempt it! Even knowing of its mere existence will only bring you frustration and anguish! Honestly, it may be one of the worst ideas I've ever had. Perhaps no one will even try. Maybe that's for the best after all... I think it will be too late for most of you anyway..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the vast majority of us who either aren't playing on PlayStation or like retaining our sanity, here's the text that appears when you accompish this. <strong>WARNING: If you consider this text a spoiler, don't keep reading below the trailer!</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><blockquote>INTERESTING.</blockquote><blockquote>YOU FAILED</blockquote><blockquote>TO ACHIEVE</blockquote><blockquote>ANY MARKS.</blockquote><blockquote>WHAT</blockquote><blockquote>ARE</blockquote><blockquote>YOU?</blockquote><blockquote>"(playername)"</blockquote><blockquote>I VERY MUCH</blockquote><blockquote>LOOK FORWARD</blockquote><blockquote>TO THE NEXT.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">This text seems to be spoken by the same voice that addresses the player in the opening of the game and in a few other places, as well as the same voice that speaks in the end credits with a different message if you finish under any other conditions. Fans, of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._D._Gaster" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have plenty of theories on who this is</a>, but we'll leave that to the community for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With chapters 3 and 4 finally out, we've reviewed Deltarune so far, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-review">giving it a 9/10</a> and saying that its "incredible story is already bursting with hilarious charm, unforgettable characters, and an iconic soundtrack that make it worth investing your time in," even though its story is only halfway done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The developer has now issued a statement, saying it is "heartbroken" over the game's difficulties.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy’s debut title came out on June 10 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via Steam. On Valve’s platform, it currently has a ‘mixed’ user review rating, with most of the complaints revolving around performance issues, bugs and glitches, broken AI, and game crashes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some players have reported gaining refunds — even from the notoriously stubborn Sony — rekindling memories of Cyberpunk 2077’s disastrous launch back in 2020. CD Projekt's game was eventually pulled from sale on the PlayStation Store, but there is no indication yet that MindsEye will suffer a similar fate.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">PlayStation is allowing refunds for MindsEye <a href="https://t.co/zzaHbNt3ET" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/zzaHbNt3ET</a> <a href="https://t.co/KclpMTwSJi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KclpMTwSJi</a></p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1933152235417939985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, streamers are saying they received requests to postpone their sponsored MindsEye livestreams, some last minute. As spotted by Kotaku's Ethan Gach, popular streamer CohhCarnage revealed this happened to him just as he was about to begin a sponsored MindsEye livestream:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>MindsEye dev canceled Twitch streamer CohhCarnage's playthrough of the game seconds before it was supposed to start.</p><p>He said it was the first time that had ever happened in his streaming career. <a href="https://t.co/KOjyQ8ml21" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KOjyQ8ml21</a></p></div>— AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1932892473249992746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“For the first time in my streaming career, I changed my title for a sponsored stream, I put in a profile button, I put in the command, that was at eight o'clock sharp — my sponsored stream was supposed to start at eight — I opened up MindsEye, and as it was loading, my management contacted me and said, ‘The sponsor does not want to do this right now, they would like to reschedule.’ And I said, ‘Oh, that’s a first.’ So the sponsor decided not to do the sponsorship for now, and honestly, it sounds like for MindsEye that was the right decision.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another streamer, DarkViperAU, couldn't even make it through their sponsored MindsEye livestream without breaking down in tears of laughter.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Sponsored MindsEye streamer can't keep it together when telling viewers where they can buy the game. <a href="https://t.co/kdR3EuGims" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/kdR3EuGims</a></p>— AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1932816433425395799?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In response to the chaos of the past 24 hours, Build A Rocket Boy issued a statement on its Discord, addressing MindsEye’s community and the game's various issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are heartbroken that not every player was able to experience the game as we intended,” the statement began. “Our priority is optimizing performance and stability so that every player, across every device, can enjoy an equally high-quality experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our teams have worked tirelessly throughout the night to solve many of these issues, and we have now identified that the vast majority of crashes were caused by a memory leak. This impacted roughly 1 in 10 of our players. We have developed a hotfix that addresses this issue (alongside other issues that our players have highlighted), which we are working hard to deploy as soon as tomorrow on PC and on consoles once it passes certification with PlayStation and Xbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are fully committed to ensuring all our players have a great experience, and we will continue to provide frequent and transparent updates. We will do our best to respond to all your comments and feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thank you for playing MindsEye. Thank you for your understanding and continued support – it truly means the world to us. We’re grateful and blessed to have you on the journey with us.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy then outlined the hotfix schedule for the coming weeks. By the end of June, it said, players can expect ongoing performance and stability improvements, a rebalanced ‘hard’ difficulty setting, animation fixes, and AI improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It remains to be seen whether Build A Rocket Boy can turn MindsEye around following this troubled start. While Steam concurrent player numbers do not paint the whole picture of a game's success, particularly single-player games, they do provide us with an idea of a game's popularity on Steam's platform. On Steam, MindsEye has a peak concurrent player count of 3,302.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Now we know it was for a remake of the first Silent Hill game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill exploded onto the scene in 1999 on the PlayStation as a Resident Evil rival from Konami. It established the series’ trademark fog-filled visuals, third-person viewpoint, and the eerie town of Silent Hill itself. It sees Harry Mason searching for his missing adopted daughter, Cheryl — and all manner of horrible things along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Silent Hill 2 remake has sold 2 million copies, so it’s no surprise to see Konami greenlight another remake in the series. And it is no surprise to see the first game get the remake treatment next. In an IGN poll, over 61% of the 20,000 voters picked Silent Hill as the Silent Hill game Konami should remake next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb from Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno, issued back in February:</p><blockquote>Konami, a legendary name in the gaming industry, sought a partner who could breathe new life into one of its most iconic franchises — Silent Hill. Bloober Team was selected for their expertise in horror and atmospheric storytelling, and in 2021, both companies signed a partnership agreement. In October 2022, during the official Silent Hill Transmission livestream, it was announced that Bloober Team was working on a remake of Silent Hill 2, widely regarded as one of the best psychological horror games in history.</blockquote><blockquote>The success of the remake proved that Bloober Team had perfectly captured the atmosphere and depth of the original while introducing crucial innovations. The game was well-received by players, earning an 86/100 rating on Metacritic and an 88/100 on OpenCritic, along with numerous awards, including Game of the Year 2024 from IGN Japan and Best Horror Game of the Year from the IGN Community Awards.</blockquote><blockquote>The trust built upon the success of Silent Hill 2 laid the foundation for signing another agreement for a new project. The deal aligns with Bloober Team’s strategic plan to expand its internal development division within a first-party framework.</blockquote><blockquote>Our collaboration with Konami has been incredibly fruitful, and the success of Silent Hill 2 speaks for itself. By sharing knowledge and experience, we have been able to create high-quality production together. Of course, we can't reveal too many details at this time, but we are confident that fans will be just as excited about our collaboration as we are. We can't wait to share something truly special with players when the time is right.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill 2 remake went on sale on PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam on October 8, 2024 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-console-exclusive-to-ps5-for-1-year"><u>there’s no word on an Xbox Series X and S version</u></a> yet), and just a few days later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-1-million-copies-in-less-than-a-week"><u>had sold 1 million copies</u></a>. This was thought to have made Silent Hill 2 remake the fastest-selling Silent Hill game ever, but Konami has yet to rubber stamp that potential record.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review"><u>Silent Hill 2 remake review</u></a> returned an 8/10.
