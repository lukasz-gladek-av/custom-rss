It's unclear if the port will release digitally-only or be sold as a physical edition, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We considered Red Dead Redemption 2 a "masterpiece" when it released in 2018, awarding it a 10/10. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review"><u>IGN's Red Dead Redemption 2 review</u></a> said: "Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open-world ode to the outlaw era."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps red Dead Redemption 2 coming to Switch 2 wouldn't come as a huge surprise. In a Q&amp;A with investors following Take-Two's most recent financial results, CEO Strauss Zelnick answered a question about the publisher's support of the Switch 2 by saying he felt "great optimism" for Nintendo's new platform. In fact, he said Nintendo's support of third-party publishers this time around was better than it had been in the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're launching four titles with Nintendo Switch 2, and that's I think a bigger array of releases than we've ever offered before with a new Nintendo platform," he said. "Historically, being a third-party in the Nintendo business has been a bit challenging. I think Nintendo has been very forthcoming in addressing that. And we're stepping up too, because we have great optimism for the platform. In terms of what we would bring to any platform, we address it on a case-by-case basis, we obviously want to be where the consumers are. But we would not necessarily bring every title to every platform. There are also great catalog opportunities as well."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Take-Two is bringing Civilization 7 (June 5, launch day), the NBA 2K and WWE 2K series (unclear which games, or when), and Borderlands 4 (September 12). Those admittedly aren't surprising inclusions, as Take-Two was already publishing all four franchises on the Nintendo Switch. But Zelnick's quote does make it sound like the door could be open in the future to other releases, especially from Take-Two's back catalog. GTA 6 probably won't make the cut, but perhaps GTA V or red Dead Redemption 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-director-vows-to-deliver-a-respectful-representation-of-japan-on-par-with-ghost-of-tsushima<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon release back in 2020, American developer Sucker Punch‚Äôs Ghost of Tsushima was generally well-received for its fictionalized depiction of historical Japan. The game‚Äôs director Nate Fox recently talked about his commitment to bringing the same kind of cultural sensitivity to the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, emphasizing the importance of research, respect, and listening to cultural advisors.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Ghost of Tsushima had us take on the role of Jin Sakai as he defends Tsushima from a Mongol invasion in the 13th century, Ghost of Yotei skips forward to 1603, where we play as female warrior Atsu in Ezo (modern day Hokkaido, Japan‚Äôs northernmost main island). She is out to wreak vengeance on a band of outlaws who murdered her family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ghost of Tsushima paid homage to classic samurai movies (with its black-and-white ‚ÄúKurosawa mode‚Äù named after legendary Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa), so it will be interesting to see if Ghost of Yotei takes any influence from Japan‚Äôs many movies featuring tough female warriors exacting revenge, like the Lady Snowblood series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/15/ghost-of-yotei-how-sucker-punch-chose-hokkaido-for-the-games-setting/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation Blog post,</u></a> Ghost of Tsushima and Ghost of Yotei director Nate Fox talked about how the research trips to Japan have not only been the ‚Äúbest part‚Äù of working on the games, they have also been highly inspiring and eye-opening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúEveryone from Sucker Punch that went on those reference gathering trips came back to the studio with a driving passion to bring a sense of authenticity to our fictional depiction of these real life places," he commented, emphasizing the importance of getting the feel for a place in person, and then using this experience to craft an original, in-game environment that matches the spirit of the real location.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/d_ishidate/status/1792615489707147300" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Comments</u></a> made by Ghost of Tsushima‚Äôs English-to-Japanese localization producer Daisuke ‚ÄúDice‚Äù Ishidate on Twitter / X back in May 2024 echo these sentiments: ‚ÄúThe Ghost of Tsushima development team told me that 'we want to create enjoyable entertainment, not a history lesson...' I think that maybe the reason for Ghost of Tsushima‚Äôs success is not objective historical accuracy but its subjective period drama-like style (and flair).‚Äù (As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ghost-of-tsushima-japanese-localization-producer-responds-to-assassins-creed-shadows/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Ghost of Tsushima read like a thoughtfully researched love letter to historical Japan with a dash of classic samurai movie thrown in. What inaccuracies it has were mostly artistic license used to create a more entertaining and atmospheric experience for the player, and to make the game more accessible to wider audiences. For its depiction of samurai, Ghost of Tsushima tapped into later centuries and the pop culture image of samurai as katana wielders, when they predominantly used bow and arrow in the 13th century (archery expert Sensei Ishikawa is perhaps the closest character to the samurai of that period). As for accessibility, Jin can compose haiku (the most widely recognized type of Japanese poem), however the haiku form didn‚Äôt develop until centuries later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Ghost of Tsushima‚Äôs towns, shrines, and environments do feel like experiencing a nature hike through Japan from the comfort of your sofa, the game took some liberties in allowing the player to experience all Japan‚Äôs seasons. The real Tsushima is subtropical, located between South Korea and Japan‚Äôs southernmost main island of Kyushu. The heavy snow that Jin encounters in Act 3 is anachronistic, as the real Tsushima is too far south to experience such weather. However, this gave players the chance to experience a sort of virtual postcard of the most iconic and famous aspects of each season in Japan. Wandering the game‚Äôs fictional Tsushima, the player moves between different seasons: abundant pink cherry blossoms bringing a splash of spring to your screen one second, only to be replaced by orangey brown autumn leaves when you enter another area.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Best PS4, Xbox One Games to Play on PS5 and Xbox Series X</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Fox explained, the digital Tsushima was never intended to be a perfect recreation of the island, but it was meant to faithfully capture the spirit of the place. In the PlayStation blog post, he commented: ‚ÄúWe felt that by listening to our cultural advisors and by doing research, we could deliver a respectful representation of what made Tsushima so special... For Ghost of Yotei, we‚Äôre doing the same thing.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fox revealed that Sony picked Hokkaido for Ghost of Yotei‚Äôs setting because it is ‚Äúunbelievably beautiful.‚Äù Upon visiting the place, Fox recounted that the dev team were struck by the contrast between the majestic views and the potential threat posed by the bears that inhabit Hokkaido‚Äôs Shiretoko National Park. ‚ÄúA perfect marriage of beauty and danger, that was the exact feeling we wanted for our game,‚Äù Fox enthused. Added to this, in 1603 when Ghost of Yotei is set, Hokkaido was a sparsely populated, harsh northern island, which the developers felt fit with the tale of a female warrior so hell-bent on revenge that the locals start to believe she is a demon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, official information about Ghost of Yotei has yet to mention how and if it will address Hokkaido‚Äôs complicated history of eventual colonization by Japan. How will Ghost of Yotei depict Hokkaido‚Äôs indigenous people, the Ainu, and their language and culture? Will it portray tensions between Japanese and Ainu populations? This could be a difficult part of the game to get right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After release, Ghost of Tsushima met with mostly positive reception from Japanese gaming media and people, gaining a perfect score from Famitsu and winning two awards at the Japan Game Awards 2021. It has also been embraced by the real life island of Tsushima, with its popularity encouraging more tourists to visit the island. The game‚Äôs director Nate Fox and creative director Jason Connell were named cultural ambassadors to the island, for their role in drawing people‚Äôs attention to Tsushima and its history. If Ghost of Yotei becomes as successful as its predecessor, it might also bring more overseas tourists to Hokkaido. However, they should probably make sure they are better prepared than <a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/japan-life/news-and-opinion/british-couple-rescued-from-mount-yotei/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the British couple who recently got stranded on Mount Yotei</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

It's a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games"><u>deck-building game</u></a>, a genre where you start with a small deck of weak cards that you can upgrade and tweak during play until you‚Äôve got a much more powerful, reliable engine. But its genius is to twin these mechanics with a squad-level tactical <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war board game</a>. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Soldier cards let you move and fire with the matching unit on the modular board in pursuit of scenario goals, while officer cards fine-tune your deck, allowing you to focus on particular squads. It's a marriage made in heaven, giving you strategic levers in deck construction, tactical thrills as you maneuver for position on the board, while still basically feeling like a simple simulation of combat where officers bolster the morale and makeup of squads under their command.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Undaunted: Normandy's success has led to a slew of games using the same basic system, which now ranges across a much wider variety of settings and complexity levels - even into outer space with a sci-fi variant. Undaunted is a great franchise, and this buying guide is here to help you decide which of its many titles is right for you.</p><p id="undaunted-normandy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: Normandy">Undaunted: Normandy</h2></p><div catalogid="ebe477e2-2f63-4623-a7f4-efd546c7aa21" id="221009"><div id="221009" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: Normandy</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best for</strong>: People who want the simplest, fastest version and don‚Äôt object to the military theme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first game in the series sets the action in the days after the allied invasion of Normandy during World War 2. While none of its predecessors are particularly complex, it is nevertheless the most accessible game in the series, focusing entirely on different types of infantry units and with a limited range of quick-playing maps. While that has an obvious attraction for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games">casual play</a>, it can feel a bit repetitive if you want to commit to playing all the scenarios in the box. It also has the most realistic historical bent apart from Undaunted: Stalingrad which might appeal to those interested in the military aspects of the series, but which some may find off putting. </p></div><p id="undaunted-north-africa"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: North Africa">Undaunted: North Africa</h2></p><div catalogid="ebe477e2-2f63-4623-a7f4-efd546c7aa21" id="221010"><div id="221010" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: North Africa</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best for</strong>: Players who want to see vehicles in their wargames, or who like cinematic action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most frequent asks from fans of the original was the addition of vehicles, and publisher Osprey Games delivered in this sequel, adding armored cars and small tanks to the mix. While these are governed by the same simple card play that drives all the units, they do necessitate a degree of extra rules overhead to cover the difference between anti-armor and small arms fire. As well as moving the setting to the North African theater, this also turns down the scale with the squad-level counters of the original turning into individual combatants. This gives the game a more gung-ho, cinematic feel, heightened by the choice to feature the allied troops as the Long Range Desert Group, the forerunner to Britain‚Äôs famous SAS. </p></div><p id="undaunted-reinforcements"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: Reinforcements">Undaunted: Reinforcements</h2></p><div catalogid="ebe477e2-2f63-4623-a7f4-efd546c7aa21" id="221011"><div id="221011" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: Reinforcements</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best for</strong>: Hardcore fans, gamers who want to solo Normandy or North Africa.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many fans of military games like to be able to play solo, even if it means playing both sides themselves, but Undaunted‚Äôs tense initiative bid system made this difficult. As a result, a key draw for this expansion, which ‚Äì unusually ‚Äì also supports both the first two games, is the addition of a complex but very effective set of AI routines to allow challenging <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a> play. Each scenario in both the original boxes has unique routines tailored for each unit, meaning the automated opposition is very effective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also new units and scenarios for both of the original games, as well as an expanded box that allows you to store both of those titles together. As good as all these features are, however, they‚Äôre only really for hardcore fans. You have to own both of the previous games and be interested in solo play to get the most out of this expansion.</p></div><p id="undaunted-stalingrad"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: Stalingrad">Undaunted: Stalingrad</h2></p><div catalogid="ebe477e2-2f63-4623-a7f4-efd546c7aa21" id="221012"><div id="221012" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: Stalingrad</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best for</strong>: Those willing to put in repeat plays for the best Undaunted experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both of the initial games could be played in a loose form of campaign, progressing through the scenarios and keeping a tally of who won what. But Stalingrad kicks things up a notch, featuring a branching campaign with narrative elements and in which the results of each scenario carry into the next. Soldiers gain experience, or carry injuries, while the city itself is slowly reduced to rubble in which troops can find cover or build fortifications. The result is an absolute triumph, earning a 10/10 in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-stalingrad-board-game-review"><u>Undaunted: Stalingrad review</u></a> by retaining all the great things that made those first two games such hits, while adding yet another strategic layer to ponder and wrapping the whole thing in a dramatic, unfolding story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is the best game in the series, beware: you and an opponent will need to commit to a lot of repeat games to get the most out of it. </p></div><p id="undaunted-battle-of-britain"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: Battle of Britain">Undaunted: Battle of Britain</h2></p><div catalogid="ebe477e2-2f63-4623-a7f4-efd546c7aa21" id="221013"><div id="221013" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: Battle of Britain</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best for</strong>: Undaunted veterans who want a novel take on familiar mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a major departure from the infantry combat that characterizes most of the Undaunted games, Battle of Britain takes the action to the skies. While the core deck building remains unchanged, the way units behave on the board is very different, reflecting the fact that airplanes can fly! Most notably, units now have a facing and they have to move each time their card comes up, meaning you have to plan more carefully, trying to set up traps for your opponent in the likely direction of travel, just like a real dogfight. However, deck construction just doesn‚Äôt fit the theme quite as well as it does in terms of having officer cards direct the combat on the ground but, despite that shortcoming, the game is still fun and full of thrills and, most importantly, feels fresh and different compared to its peers in the franchise.</p></div><p id="undaunted-2200-callisto"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted 2200: Callisto">Undaunted 2200: Callisto</h2></p><div catalogid="ebe477e2-2f63-4623-a7f4-efd546c7aa21" id="221014"><div id="221014" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted 2200: Callisto</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best for</strong>: People who want the action and strategy, but not the historical military theme</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the success of the original game, a growing body of gamers started asking the designers for a version that didn‚Äôt glory in the horrors of real-world warfare. Their answer was to move the game to outer space in this sci-fi version. It‚Äôs a fantastic translation as we explained in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-2200-callisto-board-game-review"><u>Undaunted 2200 review</u></a>: capturing all the great stuff that have made the franchise such a hit, but also learning lessons to improve on the previous entries. There are vehicles to pilot, greater asymmetry between the two factions, and a more varied mix of scenarios to enjoy. So if the military focus of the previous titles put you off, this is a fantastic alternative, and even if you‚Äôre not bothered by the theme then, mechanically speaking, it's the best of the series after Stalingrad. </p></div><p id="promo-scenarios"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Promo scenarios">Undaunted Promo Scenarios</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of the series might be interested to learn that, in the years since its release, there have been a number of additional scenarios published in magazines and given away at conventions.
