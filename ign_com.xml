It’s ahead of the likes of Valve’s own Counter-Strike 2, viral hit Schedule I, and Blizzard’s Overwatch 2, which itself received a significant new update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion remastered was also the fourth most-played game on Steam yesterday, behind only Counter-Strike 2, PUBG, and Dota 2. It’s currently the most-played single-player RPG on Steam, ahead of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-baldurs-gate-3s-steam-player-count-booming-following-patch-8-larian-now-has-room-to-focus-on-making-our-next-big-thing-as-good-as-we-can">the resurgent Baldur’s Gate 3</a>, and has a ‘very positive’ user review rating.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Steam stats do not tell the whole story, of course, and when it comes to Oblivion Remastered, there’s much more to its success. As a Microsoft-owned game (Microsoft owns Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media), Oblivion Remastered launched straight into Xbox Game Pass for Ultimate subscribers. It seems likely the game will have many players through the subscription service alone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s the PlayStation 5 and standard Xbox Series X and S release to add in. So, while neither Microsoft nor Sony make player numbers public, Oblivion Remastered’s true peak concurrent player count on launch day will be much higher than 180,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems like a big success already, although Bethesda is yet to announce a total player or sales number. And player numbers will surely get bigger as Oblivion Remastered heads into its first weekend on sale.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology. The changes are going down well with fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake">some of whom believe Oblivion Remastered would be more accurately described as a remake</a>. Bethesda, however, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-comments-on-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-changes-we-never-wanted-to-remake-it">has explained why it went down the remaster route</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion launched in 2006 as a follow-up to fan-favorite Morrowind on PC and Xbox 360, with a PlayStation 3 release following in 2007. It’s set in the fictional province of Cyrodiil, and revolves around the player character's bid to defeat a fanatical cult that wants to open portal games to the demonic realm known as Oblivion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got a comprehensive guide to everything you'll find in Oblivion Remastered, including an expansive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/cyrodiil">Interactive Map</a>, complete Walkthroughs for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Main_Quest_Walkthrough">Main Questline</a> and every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Guilds">Guild Quest</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Character_Building_Guide">How to Build the Perfect Character</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Things_to_Do_First_in_Oblivion">Things to Do First</a>, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

This isn’t filler—these are current-meta and collector-relevant expansions. It’s rare for a box at this price point to deliver both exclusive promos <em>and</em> a stack of relevant packs.

"As massive fans, we're beyond grateful for the generous gift of Oblivion Remastered game keys for our entire modding team! This means so much to us. Thank you for everything, Bethesda!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://skyblivion.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skyblivion</a> is an upcoming fan remake of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion made by the TESRenewal volunteer modding group. It uses Bethesda's Creation Engine to recreate Oblivion in the game's sequel, Skyrim. The project has technically been in the works for over a decade, beginning as a simple direct port and later expanding to a full remake with a number of improved features and even new content. We interviewed one of the developers behind it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skyblivion-oblivion-skyrim-mod-elder-scrolls">way back in 2021</a>. Skyblivion is expected to release this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Historically, Bethesda and the Skyblivion team have reportedly been on "<a href="https://www.vg247.com/skyblivion-skyrim-oblivion-remake-mod-lead-interview-c3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very good terms</a>," but as rumors of an official Oblivion remaster grew, some fans questioned if Bethesda wasn't trying to head off Skyblivion with its own version due to the suspiciously close release timing. A few days ago, anticipating today's showcase, the Skyblivion team <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k285wg/official_statement_from_the_skyblivion_team/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a statement</a> addressing these concerns. In it, the team said that Bethesda has "always been supportive of community projects like ours" and that "there is no need for comparisons or a sense of competition" between the two games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, Oblivision Remastered <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/69672" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">does not have official mod support</a>, though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-mods-have-already-been-published-online">fans have already been cooking up an array of unofficial mods for the game within hours of its release</a>. Additionally, both versions of Oblivion have unique aspects: Skyblivion, for instance, isn't available on console at all. Oblivision Remastered, on the other hand, does not include the new and refurbished content that Skyblivion has promised, but does have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-is-once-again-offering-paid-horse-armor-dlc">horse armor DLC</a> at launch for Deluxe Edition buyers. Both versions have different looks and feels, with different interpretations on how much Skyrim-ness should be incorporated into a retread of Oblivion.
