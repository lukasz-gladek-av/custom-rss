            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The team promises "an absolutely unique experience each and every year."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty will no longer release multiple Black Ops or Modern Warfare games back-to-back, after two Modern Warfare releases in 2022 and 2023, and two Black Ops releases in 2024 and 2025, respectively, and negative feedback and concerning sales reports for the most recent release, Black Ops 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This news was delivered from "<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Call of Duty team"</a> (encompassing studios Treyarch, Sledgehammer, Infinity Ward, and Raven Software) on the official website, in a post that acknowledged the criticism of Black Ops 7 as well as broader criticism of the franchise in recent years. As the post opens:</p><blockquote>First off, thank you for all for the feedback we have received over the last few months. Call of Duty has enjoyed long-standing success because of all of you, a passionate community that demands excellence and deserves nothing less. We also know that for some of you, the Franchise has not met your expectations fully. To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The post goes on to state a number of changes the Call of Duty studios will be making going forward. For starters, they're opening up Black Ops 7's multiplayer zombies mode for a free trial and Double XP weekend next week, in an effort to get those who have hesitated on Black Ops 7 to "experience the game firsthand and decide for yourselves." They also are committing to "unprecedented season support," saying that they "won't rest until Black Ops 7 earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games we’ve ever made."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, the team had this to say about future Call of Duty releases:</p><blockquote>We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year.</blockquote><blockquote>We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The note concludes by saying the team believes Call of Duty's "best days are ahead of us" and that the next era of Call of Duty will "deliver precisely on what you want along with some surprises that push the Franchise and the genre forward."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These changes come amidst, and likely in response to, a rough couple of years for the Call of Duty franchise. The most recent entry, Black Ops 7, debuted last month to middling reviews, including our own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">6/10 campaign review</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-zombies-review">6/10 Zombies review</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review">significantly better 8/10 multiplayer review</a>. This is also in the context of both Black Ops 7 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-single-player-campaign-review">Modern Warfare 3</a> receiving poor reviews in comparison to their immediate series predecessors the year before, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review">Black Ops 6</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-multiplayer-review">Modern Warfare 2</a> being received generally favorably. This likely accounts, at least in part, for the decision to stop the back-to-back releases.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For Black Ops 7, that lukewarm reception has also been reflected in the game's sales numbers, especially in relation to another recent major multiplayer shooter release, Battlefield 6. The game had a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-suffers-terrible-launch-in-europe-with-63-fewer-copies-sold-than-battlefield-6-but-theres-important-context-to-consider">"terrible" launch</a> in Europe, down 63% versus Battlefield 6 and down by more than 50% versus last year's Black Ops 6 in the equivalent periods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is worth noting that we don't have full visibility into Black Ops 7's sales data, as it launched day one on Game Pass, and a number of people likely played the game through the subscription service and didn't count as unit sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But nonetheless, the announcement today feels like an admission that something has gone wrong here. Whether or not the Call of Duty team can fix it will take a few years to truly comprehend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Picked by</strong>: IGN Deals Team</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To nobody's surprise, we have to recommend the Switch 2, especially the Mario Kart World bundle. We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World an 8 out of 10</a> in our review, with Logan Plant saying, “Mario Kart World may not make the most convincing case that going open-world was the boost the series needed, but excellent multiplayer racing, incredible polish, and the thrilling new Knockout Tour mode still more than live up to its legacy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 has been flying off shelves despite a lack of Black Friday deals, and then even more so after retailers finally dropped the price by $50 off and on during Cyber Week. There are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/All_Switch_2_Bundles">more Switch 2 bundles</a> still available that include everything from microSD Express cards to other games.

But it also meant we didn’t get a lot of “crazy toy maker” experiments, like alarm clocks, cardboard backpacks, or micro-sized consoles. Which is why my pick for the perfect Nintendo fan gift this year isn’t exactly something truly new: it’s the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/metroid-prime-4-beyond/Amiibo_Functionality,_Rewards,_and_Unlocks">Metroid Prime 4 amiibo</a> triple threat of Samus herself, Samus &amp; Vi-O-La, and bounty hunter Sylux. Metallic paint amiibo are often some of the best – and I’m really liking the more aggressive stance of the standalone Samus and her shiny-red new suit and motorbike combo. Sylux himself looks a bit like an evil, blue Masterchief, rocking his trademark shoulder spikes. </p></div><div id="233483" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>amiibo Samus &amp; Vi-O-La - Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Series</h3></p></div><div catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287" id="233485"><div id="233485" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>amiibo Sylux Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Series</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The two Metroid amiibo are available now and Sylux is out now (as of December 4).</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>3. Switch 2 Pro Controller</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Picked by</strong>: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/mrhurgy">Logan Plant</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The S<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">witch 2 Pro Controller</a> might be the best controller Nintendo has ever produced, finally unseating the GameCube controller after more than 20 years on top. Its matte material feels fantastic in the hands (and somehow never gets grimy), the control sticks have a great level of tension, the ZL and ZR triggers fit your fingers perfectly, and the new GL and GR back buttons add extra flexibility to whatever game you’re playing. Plus, it has a headphone jack, which was easily the Switch 1 Pro Controller’s biggest weakness. And, it has fantastic battery life – I’ve only had to charge mine a handful of times since the Switch 2 launched in June. Sure, Switch 1 controllers work on Switch 2, but the hardcore Nintendo fan in your life deserves this massive upgrade.</p></div><div catalogid="09569512-2c92-4dd0-88a7-4eb7d80358a4" id="224941"><div id="224941" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>4.

Characters of your choosing will watch over you while you sleep, and while that may sound creepy, it's not. They're actually collecting info on how well you're sleeping, and sharing it with you, because that's what friends do. Even if you don't use it for its intended alarm…o purposes, it's still an adorable time piece to keep on your desk. The screen is bright and crisp, and the dial on the top feels excellent to use and set. Best of all, they added Kirby with the most recent update, and who doesn't love Kirby? Don't answer that question, please. I don't want to know. </p></div><div catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287" id="233486"><div id="233486" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alarmo</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>5.

We called Donkey Kong Bananza a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">10/10 masterpiece in our review</a> back in July, praising its destructible environments and incredible movement. It may not star Mario or Link, but this is a top-shelf first-party Nintendo game that got the Switch 2 generation off to a smashing start. It takes between 15 and 20 hours just to reach the credits, with dozens of more hours waiting for anyone that wants to see absolutely every banana tucked inside. If I were a kid, I can’t think of a game I’d have more fun with on Christmas morning than this one.</p></div><div catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287" id="233487"><div id="233487" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Donkey Kong Bananza</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>6.

Everything about the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-the-lego-game-boy-set-72046">LEGO Game Boy</a> is delightful, from the screens you can change out to reflect the game you want to show off, to the replica carts you build with it. It's roughly the same size as an actual Game Boy, too, and the buttons feel almost identical to the ones on the real deal. It only takes around an hour to put together, and then you have this super cool collectible to show off to everyone who asks, and even people who don't ask. Stop people on the street, get their opinion of it.

Pokémon Legends: Z-A</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Picked by</strong>: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/jkienlen">Jacob Kienlen</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been a fan of Pokémon games since I first got my own copy of Pokémon Yellow Version on the Game Boy back in the 90s. I’ve played almost <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-games-in-order">every mainline entry in the series</a> since then, and I was super excited to start playing Pokémon Legends: Z-A when it launched this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN gave the game a solid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review"><u>8/10 review</u></a>, and I agree that it’s a great game overall. It takes bits and pieces of Legends: Arceus and Scarlet and Violet that brought new life to the series and flat out does those things better. The entire story takes place in a single location (Luminose City), which seems so small until the game starts to unfold and you meet new people and unlock new areas. It’s the urban Pokémon game I didn’t know I needed, and I’d recommend it to any fellow Pokéfan looking for their next obsession.</p></div><div catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287" id="233490"><div id="233490" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon™ Legends: Z-A</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>8.

Kirby Meta Knight Plushie</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Picked by</strong>: IGN Deals Team</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are SO many plushies to choose from these days, but only so many unique ones for Nintendo lovers. Even across the Kirby online universe, there are several versions of cuddly Kirbys you can get. However, this Kirby Adventure Series' Meta Knight plushie is honestly way cool and stands out from the basic (but still cute) classic Kirbys out there.
