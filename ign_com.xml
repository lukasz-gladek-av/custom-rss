            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nature, a game about creating an ecosystem and evolving its inhabitants, is not exactly a new idea. Publisher <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/NorthStarGameStudio/AllGames/page/25D1D1E6-4BE8-460C-88A5-76F141CDAAE7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>North Star Games</u></a> first released a similar title, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5Xd5V?object_uuid=35714c69-489d-4f32-ba97-5a805a035441&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0725LRH1W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Evolution</u></a>, in 2014. Evolution spawned multiple expansions and spinoffs over the subsequent years, to much acclaim. Designer <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/3245/dominic-crapuchettes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dominic Crapuchettes</a> just can’t let this idea go as 2025’s Nature is the latest iteration of this longstanding series. I’m glad he’s stuck with it, because this new standalone title is the most splendid variation yet.</p><div catalogid="63e640fa-0407-4587-ba23-f4273724f4dd" id="227874"><div id="227874" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nature Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like in <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/155703/evolution" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution</a>, players steward a number of distinct species they must feed and protect. You gain a new budding lifeform in each of the four rounds, with species consisting of a size and population. The former represents its overall mass and scale, while the latter is the number of animals in the genus. So a small herd of elephant-like creatures would have a size of four but only a couple of population. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most interesting aspect is that each species also consists of up to three trait cards. This is the nerve center of the design, as it consists of a nuanced card system that elicits difficult strategic decisions. The biggest concern is hand management, as well as guiding the evolutionary force in response to a shifting environment. Each animal is fighting for survival, and that includes gathering precious limited food from the central watering hole, or possibly going the carnivore route and hunting for sustenance. Your ability to work toward these goals and curb threats rests in the card play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trait cards function primarily as evolving mechanisms for defense or food gathering. You can play a Fast card on one of your species to help them outrun predators. Or maybe armored plating to provide a hardy shell. Similarly, claws may help you gather plants more efficiently, or provide an offensive bonus when hunting other creatures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s marvelous is that the system is ostensibly a tableau builder. This is a style of game, popularized by games like <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrjln?object_uuid=35714c69-489d-4f32-ba97-5a805a035441&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B000YLAOEW" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Race for the Galaxy</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/98P2xO?object_uuid=35714c69-489d-4f32-ba97-5a805a035441&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B08F65MX4L" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>7 Wonders</u></a>, where players place cards in their own personal area, creating an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine</a> to generate points or resources. Nature twists this formula to create dynamic isolated tableaus that represent player-crafted species. So instead of managing a single tableau, players construct and manipulate several small sets of various properties. It’s a clever concept, using an existing mechanism to craft an ecosystem of evolving entities that must continually change in order to adapt to their environment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The environmental pressures that incentivize adaptation are mainly a result of the hunter system. When you are playing cards during your turn, you may always slap a hunter trait onto one of your species. This makes them carnivores, shirking the watering hole and instead seeking to outmaneuver prey and feed on their population. A reason to do this is that the watering hole plant food is limited, particularly late game when the number and population of species has escalated. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Predators also devour population, effectively harming opponent’s tableaus and weakening their species. Population and feeding lead to points in this game, as each token of food devoured gets banked for end game scoring. Feeding off another player’s pack not only scores you points, but it also lowers the ceiling on their food consumption. It’s a brutal aspect of the game, but one rooted in player interaction and evolutionary force.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of these processes are identical to Nature’s predecessor, Evolution. The reason for this new edition of the game was to unify the design and its many branching expansions under a single family of products that all function together. This also allows for the Nature base game to be streamlined and simplified for a new generation of players. Crapuchettes' goal here is to craft a game that offers a welcoming enough foundation for a wide audience, while allowing for endless expansion to layer complexity and nuance atop that sturdy base. Nature is intended to appeal to virtually any level of gamer, hobbyist or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">newcomer</a>.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By at measure, Nature is predominantly a success. There are several expansion modules that add things such as dinosaurs, flying creatures, random events, and environments such as the Amazon or Arctic Tundra. Most add a new deck of trait cards which are kept separate from the primary set of cards. The unified implementation makes for easier integration, with setup and teardown being quite simple. The framework also allows for multiple expansions to be used together in order to tweak the experiences. This is the strongest quality of Nature, as it plays quite differently depending on the chosen content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Say for instance you want a more violent and exciting game. The Jurassic expansion adds more nifty tools for predators, so that’s an easy inclusion. But tossing in the Amazon setting will also introduce a bluffing element with hidden traits, which will ratchet up the tension and result in more daring attacks. Next time you play you can swap Jurassic for Flight, which will result in a far less confrontational session and instead focus on flocks of birds migrating as a new avenue for scoring.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The extensibility is a core asset of the design.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The extensibility is a core asset of the design. Nature as a streamlined and simplified experience on its own would be disappointing for those of who have played this game system previously. But I don’t think comparing the core set of Nature to Evolution: Climate is fair. The breadth and scope of each product needs to be evaluated, and Nature’s ability to evolve and plug in new content in a manner similar to its own player-driven trait selection is frankly, a magnificent adaptation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main drawback to Nature is the somewhat obtuse feeding process. The process involves grabbing food from the watering hole equal to the size of your species, and is completely independent of the population. Additionally, bigger creatures don’t need to eat any more food, which is odd. This works mechanically and is an important aspect of the system, but it’s unintuitive and something players can struggle to internalize. The rest of the design is elegant, with the card play being clean and consistent and everything flowing extraordinarily well. I’m not sure the design itself could be carved away any further, but it’s a lingering question due to this mechanism not sitting perfectly flush.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Nature meets its overall objective. It has a modest ruleset, and massive potential. Inserting a new expansion is seamless and the additional rules heft is only a couple of paragraphs. The core system is still sharp. It conveys its themes of evolutionary biology effortlessly. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/north-star-video-games">North Star Games</a> continues to progress its flagship hobbyist title, unfurling new tricks and peculiarities.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Sep 11, 2025 5:32 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Nature is both an entirely new game system and an iteration. It successfully blends a solid core framework with a long line of additional content players can add to tweak and adjust the experience. There is a tremendous amount of potential here, and much of it has already been realized.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/nature-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>
