When I <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-the-final-preview">previewed the game</a> back in January, I was creeped out by the new Tartarus (positive reaction) and delighted by the upgrades made from the original Persona 3, another game I love dearly. Of course, it was even better to experience it as a whole in a full playthrough.
