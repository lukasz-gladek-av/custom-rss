            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/palia-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s something uniquely satisfying about putting down roots in a sleepy town in games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-for-switch">Animal Crossing</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-review-2024">Stardew Valley</a>, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-review">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>. Palia evolves this tradition to great effect, injecting large-scale multiplayer into that tried-and-true formula. After 50 hours of chopping down trees, hunting woodland critters, decorating my home, and hanging out with my fellow Palians, I’ve had a fantastic time catching up on all I’ve missed since the early days of the beta. I still have to dive into the new content and loads of updates that arrived today with its console launch and first major expansion, Elderwood, but I am eager to do so ahead of my final review.=</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palia is a cozy life sim with one major tweak: you’re in an online world that occasionally compels you to come out of your shell and interact with other humans – a sometimes Herculean task for the introverts often drawn to this genre. As you explore, you’ll encounter others out in the shared world going about their business, and are encouraged (or sometimes required) to cooperate with them. For example, you’ll get a buff for fishing with others and will find magical trees that can only be chopped down with the help of one or more friends. This has led to a community that’s astoundingly positive and helpful, with the vast majority of the public chat being PSAs from players who have found a valuable resource they’d like to share with strangers, then waiting for minutes on end for everyone to assemble before collecting it as a group. I spend a lot of time playing multiplayer games defined by the community’s potent toxicity and savage greed, so this kind of culture has truly been a shock to my system that I’m still adjusting to.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although multiplayer is its signature twist, you can still do the vast majority of Palia’s activities by yourself. There’s also just a whole heck of a lot for you to do however you decide to tackle it, all in service of building up your home and improving your relationships with the NPC townsfolk. The usual zen-like staples like cooking and catching bugs are all here and actually quite good – the fishing minigame, for example, is less mindless than you usually find in the genre, having you tug and pull on your rod as the fish leaps into the air and puts up a fight. There’s even a few less common options like hunting, where you’ll pick off poor critters who burrow into the ground and leap into trees as you pepper them with arrows. While an absence of stress is an intentional focus of Palia’s design, it sometimes tries a bit too hard to accomplish that goal, like in how your arrows will magically home in on your target incredibly aggressive, sometimes turning corners to aid your aim. I’m all for a laid back experience, but it can be a bit obnoxious when you’re trying to line up a shot and the magnetism training wheels curve your arrow toward a different creature altogether, frustrating what’s supposed to be a chill activity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palia has a surprisingly full-featured main story as well. It has you exploring ancient ruins to uncover the truth about a world which was once populated by humans who are curiously gone now, and the dark history of magic that seemingly caused the collapse of society. This adventure is much more light-hearted than that might sound though, and you’re mostly just given opportunities to learn about the world and hang out with the characters who accompany you on quests while you platform around and solve simple puzzles. Per Palia’s adherence to cozy virtues, none of this is particularly demanding, and the mainline quests can be completed in a matter of hours if you focus on them, but I enjoyed diving just a tad deeper into the world and the break from grinding for iron ore to craft the next piece of furniture I just couldn’t live without. The story was quite incomplete ahead of the Elderwood expansion though, so I’m intrigued to see where it picks up after that abrupt end.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Palia has one of the better home building systems I’ve seen. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s other minigames that further mix things up, like a hotpot-themed card game I spent way too much time playing, or a surprisingly intricate platforming puzzle that took me hours to master. Sometimes these experiments exceed Palia’s grasp, like the platforming puzzles in particular, which are held back by clunky controls that don’t seem like they were designed with precision in mind. Climbing can be a quite irritating experience as your character will let go of surfaces inconsistently, sending you plummeting to your death. Thankfully the stakes in taking these spills are always very low, so there’s not much to lose aside from a bit of your time wasted, but it can definitely make some of the quests feel a bit tacked on. Other times, you’ll find yourself doing a sliding picture puzzle and think “y’know, this is pretty nice,” so I mostly found myself happy they took these shots nonetheless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the purpose behind all these various undertakings is to gain as much gold as you can to upgrade and decorate your home, and Palia has one of the better home building systems I’ve seen. Rather than giving you no control over the blueprint of your house like in Animal Crossing or Disney Dreamlight Valley, or making you monkey around with a building mode that has you placing individual walls like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-4-review-2024">The Sims</a>, Palia favors a modular system: You unlock schematics for pieces of a home that you can freely snap onto various parts of your building, making it easy to design the general layout without having to get lost in the weeds. Then, once you’ve built your place, you can decorate it down to the most minute detail, dragging furniture, dolls, and cups around on a grid to make it just so. I could probably spend dozens of hours on this part of Palia alone, were it not for my insatiable need for cold hard cash to fund my homestead expansion. But that desire to make your place exactly as awesome as you want it to be is a serious motivator that sent me out in search of lumber and iron ore time and time again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those resource grinds each have their own progression systems as well, as you level up by repeatedly going out into the world and bringing back your haul of raw materials and collectibles to sell. I played dozens of hours of Palia as part of an early preview way back before it was even in its current open beta (and had my save file from that time tragically deleted), and the biggest change has been that its progression systems for these activities are much more streamlined and feel less grindy. Now, as you plant trees and craft furniture, you’ll unlock new equipment like a loom for creating fabric or a furnace for creating glass. You’ll also get better tools to perform cozy chores with, like a hoe that lets you till land faster or a bow and arrows that will let you take down prey in fewer shots, each of which feels like a handy upgrade that shows up at exactly the right moment you start feeling a need for it. The timegating that sometimes boxes you out of marathoning through everything in other life sims is mercifully absent here for the most part, so you can move as fast or as slow as you care to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other major pursuit in Palia is in getting to know and develop relationships with its 25 NPC residents, most of whom are really well-written and have a lot more to them than meets the eye upon first glance. I quite enjoyed hanging out with the sarcastic and moody daughter of the mayor, Kenyatta, who worked the front desk with all the enthusiasm of April from Parks and Recreation – but after helping her down the extremely chaotic path of discovering what she’s passionate about in life, I grew to appreciate her in a less superficial way. Even characters I really didn't jive with, like the cryptid-obsessed hippy who annoyed me to no end, Elouisa, was at least entertainingly irritating and I’ve learned to appreciate how much her personality bothers me over time. (We’ve all got a friend like that, don’t we?) Most characters have an arc that takes place over several quests where they let you see a bit more of their personality as you forge a friendship. And, of course, if you’re looking for more than friendship you can partake in Palia’s quite strong dating mechanics to get yourself a girlfriend or boyfriend, or several of them – no judging here.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Relationships are the one area where timegating gets in the way.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this is one area where timegating gets in the way of a good time, and is one of the only places Palia boxes you out. You’re only allowed to chat with each character once per in-game day (a 30-minute period of real time), which improves your social links a very small amount, and you can only give each character a gift once per real world day. So if you’re trying to finish a particular character’s story, you’ll have to log on with regularity and be subjected to the same rotation of brief banter before you’re able to make any real progress. This is especially painful early on when your citizenship in Kilima Village is dependent on having someone in town to vouch for you – a task that’s made impossible to do in a short span of time by timegating. When every other area of Palia lets you play to your heart’s content, it’s pretty annoying to see such an essential part of this slice of life block you from progressing at your own pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palia has come a long way since I played it over a year ago, but one thing that remained true ahead of this latest update is that it’s still missing quite a bit. The two maps I’ve explored are fairly small, and though they’ve got nooks and crannies to run around, you can more-or-less see most of what’s available in a few hours. Social features, though awesome when they happen, still feel quite slim for a game where the killer feature is supposed to be its online functionality, and there aren’t enough activities that encourage group play. And although there are quite a few options for decorating your house, surprisingly little of it can be interacted with once placed. You can’t lie in bed, turn on the sink, or really do much of anything with most objects, which sometimes made me feel like I was building a museum rather than a home. They did add the ability to flick the light switches on and off, which is at least something, but there’s a lot missing. These are all issues likely to be built out in the future, and I’m interested to see if Elderwood helps at all, but I’m a bit surprised that some of these aren’t farther along all the same.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Cozy Games</h3><p>If you're looking for a game that pairs well with a warm blanket and a hot cup of tea, look no further than these TieGuyTravis-approved recommendations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The other major issue with Palia has been its bugs and performance issues on PC, which have gotten remarkably better since I last played, but are still pretty common. I quite frequently see NPCs sink into the floor, sometimes altogether hidden underground to the point where I can’t interact with them, there’s a bunch of very visible pop-in that happens while you’re running around, and loading times when traveling between each section of the map feel far longer than they should. Playing on the Nintendo Switch is especially eyebrow raising, as everything looks pretty awful and runs significantly worse, to the point where I really can’t recommend it on that platform in the same way I enthusiastically would elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve put quite a bit of time into Palia over the past week and have had a hard time putting it down, even as I’ve completed all the major activities available before the Elderwood expansion arrives. I’m looking forward to seeing how it runs on the PS5 and Xbox, checking out the new area and quality of life improvements, and continuing my chase for unlimited money to flex on my friends with my meticulously decorated estate.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/palia-temp-score-1747169197396.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, if you don't have the accessories to look after all those cards, well, it's bad news. </p><p id="tldr-best-accessories"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TL;DR: Best Accessories">TL;DR: These Are the Best Pokémon Card Accessories</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's nothing wrong with cheap deck boxes and relying on penny sleeves for bulk and budget decks; we all have to start somewhere. But as soon as trainers start putting more money behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-glory-of-team-rocket-single-prices-crashed-japanese">chase cards</a>, pulling gem mint cards, or investing in new sets like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-destined-rivals-preorder-guide-2025">Destined Rivals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-where-to-buy">Black Bolt, and White Flare</a>, they must protect what they have. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are some great products I've found to do just that. From pre-grading your cards to affordable play mats for trainers, I've got you covered with decent products that will protect your collection for years to come.</p><p id="deck-boxes"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Deck Boxes">Best Pokémon Card Deck Boxes</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these deck boxes are felt lined and made of solid materials to protect your decks. If you're like me and double sleeve your cards, all of these deck boxes have the room to fit a full 60 card deck and change.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/pxl-20250506-071623765-1746515818077.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">My premium deck box cases - Credit: Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some even hold multiple decks and dice, which is very cool for someone like me who looks way too much into these things. The one I use holds three double-sleeved decks, has a dice drawer with felt lining and even features a faux leather Pokéball design. Perfection.</p><p id="grading-accessories"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Grading Accessories">Best Pokémon Card Grading Accessories</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It can cost upwards of $20 to get a single card graded, which is worth it if the Pokémon card is in awesome condition and worth a lot. But grading companies look at your cards down to a microscopic level to check for dints, scratches and other imperfections. You'll also need to penny sleeve then pop cards in a semi rigid sleeve or they won't accept them. If you're looking to get your cards graded, these are some of the accessories we'd recommend. </p><p id="display-options"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Display Options">Best Pokémon Card Display Options</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magnetic card holders are a cheap way to display Pokémon cards on a shelf or stand without forking out a fortune to have all of your cards graded.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/pxl-20250504-163911753-1746515519420.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">My magnetic card holders, acrylic shelving with LED lighting - Credit: Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I personally use acrylic shelving and LED strips to really make my collection pop. If you want your card holders to stand up straight there's also a couple of options for acrylic stands too. It really doesn't have to break the bank to make those illustration rares shine.</p><p id="storage"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Storage">Best Pokémon Card Storage</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Going to a card show with some trades? They'll be something here for you. Want to display your grails in a nice looking cabinet? I've got you covered there too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/pxl-20250504-164349344-mp-1746515590684.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">My cardboard card organizer - Image Credit: Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ripping packs is awesome, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trading-card-storage-ideas">storing all that bulk</a> for a deck-building session isn't. Our recommendations include everything from basic cardboard boxes with rows and dividers to foam-padded storage boxes with enough room for graded and top-loaded cards. </p><p id="card-sleeves"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Card Sleeves">Best Pokémon Card Sleeves</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no good buying these cases, binders and deckboxes without card sleeves. If you like a card or pull anything holo, sleeve it. I personally like the "Perfect Fit" sleeves as they still fit in magnetic card holders, standard and penny sleeves. Double the protection, infinite peace of mind. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't build a deck without double sleeving cards. It's just a good habit to get into, especially if you're rocking all shiny energies and higher-end ex cards.</p><p id="binders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Binders">Best Pokémon Card Binders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Binders are one of the cheapest ways to store your Pokémon cards, and it beats any art or coffee table book for casual browsing. All of these binders are double-sided with nine pockets on each side. One even has four front windows to showcase those banger chase cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just don't forget to sleeve your cards before putting them in. I'm a big fan of good binder behaviour and will 100% judge you otherwise.</p><p id="playmats"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Playmats">Best Pokémon Playmats</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I recently found my original Pokémon TCG playmat from when the base set released. It's literally a bit of fabric so I put a playmat underneath anyway, but how retro is this!? God bless that broken Professor Oak trainer card.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/pixel-9-2025-05-06t080928-872-1746515374018.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">My very first Pokémon TCG playmat from 1999 - Credit: Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're playing Pokémon TCG, you need a playmat, end of story. You can double-sleeve your all-shiny deck and have a felt-lined deck box all day long, but slamming cards onto hard surfaces is going to deck your deck. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might notice that some of these playmats are actually mouse pads; that's because they're pretty much the same thing. Just do what I do: Pick a cool design and roll with it. </p><p id="latest-stock-updates"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Latest Stock Updates">Pokémon TCG: Latest Stock Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've dedicated your life to pulling chase cards yourself, here's what we can find <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-may-12-2025">in stock right now</a>. Just watch out for pricing over MSRP, as we Pokémon trainers are in a weird spot right now, so don't pay more than what you have to, or consider buying single cards instead of gambling on overpriced ETBs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever you decide, make sure you're having fun!

The offer will be available only from 9 a.m. ET to 11 p.m. ET on May 16, so you’ll need to plan ahead to take advantage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve never used TCGplayer before, it’s an online marketplace where sellers can post listings for all kinds of trading cards. You can buy specific cards or sealed products like bundles and booster packs, so there are options for established collectors or newcomers looking to build their first deck. Plus, you can preorder upcoming releases, including the anticipated collaboration between Magic: The Gathering and Final Fantasy (more on that in a bit).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are thousands of sellers on the platform with listings across an expansive list of games. That includes <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961055/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Magic: The Gathering</u></a>, Pokémon (in both <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961056/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>English</u></a> and <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961058/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Japanese</u></a>), <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961059/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Yu-Gi-Oh!</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961060/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Digimon</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961062/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Flesh and Blood</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961065/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Disney Lorcana</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961066/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>One Piece</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961068/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Dragon Ball Super</a>, and lots more. There are dozens in all, with a detailed filtering system that lets you specifically search for what you’re looking for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, let’s say you’re looking for Magic: The Gathering cards. You can select that as your product line, then further filters open up based on that line. So if you’re only interested in a particular color, you can specify that. Or if you want to see what’s available from a particular set, you can do that too. You can also filter by card type (like creature, sorcery, instant, etc.).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every product line has its own unique filters. So for Pokémon cards, you can see holofoil listings. For Yu-Gi-Oh!, you can see 1st Editions and Unlimited cards. For Disney Lorcana, you can see cold foils. You get the idea. Or if you’re on the hunt for a specific card, you can bypass all those filters and just type the card’s name in the search bar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For every card or pack in the shop, you’ll see how much the cheapest listing costs, how many total listings there are of that item, and the current market price of it. The market price is based on the history of completed transactions for that item. When you click on the item, you can see more information about the history of its market price and look at the prices and card quality of every available listing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All products on TCGplayer (other than gift cards) will be eligible for the store credit promotion from 9 a.m. ET to 11 p.m. ET on May 16. There are no limitations based on price, card type, or anything else. The timing might seem a little restrictive, but you can prepare beforehand by putting items in your cart and waiting to check out during the promotional period. That still counts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everybody who checks out during that 14-hour period will get a base return of 10% of the purchase price. Existing TCGplayer subscribers — or anyone who subscribes before they make a qualified purchase during the Mayhem promotion — will get a base return of 12% plus an additional return based on how long they’ve been subscribed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-graphics-card-in-stock-on-amazon-includes-doom<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The best bang-for-your-buck Nvidia Blackwell GPU for 4K gaming.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are planning a PC build and have been waiting patiently to get ahold of one of the new Nvidia Blackwell graphics cards, here's an opportunity that's as good as you're going to get. Right now Amazon has Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Gaming graphics cards in stock starting at $899.99 shipped. Inventory is reserved for Amazon Prime members only.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also for a limited time, you'll get a free voucher for the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> game with purchase. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/campaigns/doom-the-dark-ages-rtx-bundle/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Nvidia</a>, the version you'll receive is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-doom-the-dark-ages">Premium edition</a> that retails for $99.99.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU in Stock on Amazon</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Amazon Prime members only for some models</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although the MSRP for these cards range from $899.99 to $999.99, a reference GeForce RTX 5070 Ti card is actually <em>supposed</em> to sell for $750. More advanced cooling designs, a more uncommon colorway, or overclocking out of the box add to the cost, but even then, admittedly, these cards are still priced higher than what Nvidia originally advertised.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reality is that even third party manufacturers like Gigabyte, MSI, Asus (and pretty much everyone else) are also taking advantage of the high demand by marking prices up from the get-go. Unfortunately, you'd be hard pressed to find another RTX 5070 Ti GPU for this price or less. <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7Evpn?object_uuid=11b2045e-4487-40cd-a8c9-3ebe3097ad25&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RTX 5070 Ti GPUs are generally selling for over $1,000 on eBay</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The RTX 5070 Ti GPU Has Excellent 4K Gaming Performance</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all the Blackwell cards released thus far, the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck, especially when pitted against the previous generation GPUs. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and already marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution with ray tracing enabled. Heck, even if you plan on using this card for AI, the RTX 5070 Ti might be the better value than the RTX 50870 since both are equipped with the same 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
