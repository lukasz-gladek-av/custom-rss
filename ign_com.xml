It was September’s best-seller on both the Xbox and aggregated PC storefront charts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most importantly for publisher 2K Games, Borderlands 4 generated the highest launch month dollar sales of any title in the franchise’s history, nearly 30% higher than the previous best, Borderlands 3.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting this stat isn’t about unit sales, rather revenue generated. Borderlands 4 launched at $69.99 (eventually, after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-standard-edition-price-set-at-70-after-all">a weird kerfuffle online about whether it would jump to $80</a>), with the Deluxe Edition priced $99.99 and the Super Deluxe Edition at $129.99. At its launch in September 2019, Borderlands 3 cost $59.99 for the standard edition, $79.99 for the Deluxe Edition, and $99.99 for the Super Deluxe Edition. It's also worth noting that Borderlands 3 was a PC exclusive to the Epic Games Store for six months after its release, whereas Borderlands 4 launched across PC via Steam as well as consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, we don’t have hard sales figures yet (2K Games has made no announcement so far). But according to Circana, Borderlands 4 was the first Borderlands title to launch as the best-selling game of its release month, so there’s that.</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There were encouraging signs for Borderlands 4 when it came out last month. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-the-biggest-borderlands-ever-on-steam-just-an-hour-after-launch">It set a peak concurrent player number record for the franchise on Steam</a> (neither Sony nor Microsoft make player numbers public). But it has suffered from performance issues that have contributed to its ‘mixed’ Steam review rating on Valve’s platform. Gearbox has issued a series of patches since launch, but fans are waiting for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gearbox-confirms-the-big-borderlands-4-patch-that-will-finally-dull-the-infamous-crit-knife-is-now-set-to-launch-alongside-the-horrors-of-kairos-mini-event">Borderlands 4 ‘Day 30 Update,’ which is due out later this week</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NBA 2K26, by the way, is 2025’s best-selling game year-to-date, ahead of Capcom’s Monster Hunter: Wilds. Helldivers 2 was the fourth best-selling game of September on Xbox platforms, after debuting third during its August launch month. Helldivers 2 ranked as the sixth best-selling game overall in September and was 19th for the 2025 year-to-date period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
