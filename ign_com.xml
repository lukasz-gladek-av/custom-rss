It was announced at The Game Awards 2024 with a debut trailer, below, and a 2025 release window.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The network test will allow three players to team up and take their chosen Nightfarers to battle "against new terrors, and explore an ever-changing map to defeat increasingly challenging bosses and ultimately take on the Nightlord," Bandai Namco added, before confirming the network test features a three day-and-night cycle squads must try to outlast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb:</p><blockquote>The all-new adventure in Elden Ring Nightreign begins at the Roundtable Hold, set in a universe parallel to the events of Elden Ring. Players must choose from eight unique characters, each with their own abilities and powerful Ultimates. Their journeys take them to Limveld, an ever-changing environment, where they will have to make split-second decisions when it comes to combat and exploration in the face of a night cycle that shrinks the map with the coming Night‚Äôs Tide.</blockquote><blockquote>At the end of each night, players will face a powerful boss and, if victorious, awaken to bigger challenges. Each session will culminate in the third night when they must face off against the chosen Nightlord. Individuals can fight the night alone, but strength will come in numbers. Nightfarers must learn to cooperate to take down these challenges, combining their unique abilities together for an unparalleled experience. All is not lost for those who fall in defeat. Unsuccessful runs will grant players relics to allow them to customize and upgrade their characters tailored to their personal play styles.</blockquote><blockquote>Elden Ring Nightreign is unlike any experience created before by FromSoftware, Inc. In this condensed action RPG, players will never experience the same journey twice as enemies, rewards, and Limveld itself are ever-shifting and evolving with each new session. Defeating greater enemies and venturing into the more dangerous parts of the map will uncover more powerful weapons and greater Rune rewards. Finding Sites of Grace gives each hero a chance to level up and gain crucial power. With each session-based adventure being akin to playing through an open-air dungeon, every journey provides an opportunity to grow lasting stat bonuses. Successful runs against the night bring players ever closer to defeating the Nightlord and unraveling the story behind each Nightfarer in this parallel world.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year IGN had the opportunity to visit FromSoftware and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-we-played-it"><u>go hands-on with an early build of Elden Ring Nightreign</u></a>.

"Travel to a new region, get over 10 hours of additional content, and unlock a new weapon type, new skills, gear, and abilities."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Travel to a new region, get over 10 hours of additional content, and unlock a new weapon type, new skills, gear, and abilities.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The phrasing is a little confusing, as it makes it sound as though Claws of Awaji will only be available to those who pre-purchase the game, similar to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-has-day-one-missions-only-available-through-season-pass-or-by-preordering">the previously announced "bonus mission" Thrown to the Dogs</a>. This would be unusual, however, as major expansions such as this are usually reserved for Season Passes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition-price-drops-50-amid-cancelled-season-pass-and-early-access">Ubisoft is ditching the Season Pass model for Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> following major  practice shake-ups <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed">in the wake of Star Wars Outlaws underperforming</a>. Alongside scrapping the Season Pass, which would typically let players access two larger expansions for an additional $30 or so, Ubisoft is cancelling plans to charge players more to play on launch day. It is therefore assumed DLC expansions such as Claws of Awaji will be made free for all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though details are restricted to the brief paragraph published to Steam, the name Claws of Awaji does shed some light on what players will find in the DLC. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/assassins-creed-shadows-official-collectors-edition-trailer-ubisoft-forward-2024">Ubisoft quietly revealed Assassin's Creed Shadows' world map in the Collector's Edition trailer</a>, which showed nine detailed regions plus one small island left blank.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/10/untitled-1736512942490.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Assassin's Creed Shadows' world map, per the Collector's Edition trailer. Image credit: Ubisoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This island is the Awaji the Claws of Awaji title presumably references, meaning this currently blank area of the map should one day be filled in through DLC. Awaji Island is perhaps most famous for its prominence in the Japanese religion of Shinto, where it is said to be the first island created in the world through the legend of Izanagi and Izanami.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Assassin's Creed has delved further and further into mythology and not just history with recent releases, especially in the role-playing game series which Shadows belongs to, fans will perhaps get to delve into Japanese legends with the addition of the Claws of Awaji.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will be longer than expected before this is possible, of course, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-this-time-by-another-month">Ubisoft has delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows once again</a>, this time to March 20. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025">It was first pushed to February 14</a> from its November 12 release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot rests on the shoulders of Assassin's Creed Shadows as not only the long-awaited Japan-set entry and the first full Assassin's Creed since 2020, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales">a struggling Ubisoft needs it to perform well</a> following recent flops and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-investors-grill-ceo-cfo-on-potential-tencent-sale-delays-and-financial-woes">investor frustration</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not enjoyed a particularly positive promotional period so far, however, with the development team having to apologize on separate occasions for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">inaccuracies in Assassin's Creed Shadows' depictions of Japan</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission">using a historical recreation group's flag without permission</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another controversy came as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design">collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</a> over its "insensitive" design, and combined with the two delays, fans are growing increasingly impatient as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Popular mods include turning Iron Man into Vegeta from Dragon Ball and Mantis into a goth. There‚Äôs even a mod that turns Jeff the Land Shark into Pochita from Chainsaw Man.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/10/mr-1736510188657.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Vegeta as Iron Man mod for Marvel Rivals has been downloaded over 60,000 times. Image credit: Nexus Mods.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Using mods violates Marvel Rivals‚Äô terms of use, and developer NetEase itself has warned players against modifying game files. Despite the risk of getting banned, Marvel Rivals mods remain hugely popular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until now. Players are reporting the Season 1 update has added asset hash checking, which in turn has disabled mods. The official Marvel Rivals Discord is starting to fill up with questions from bemused players who are asking why their mods aren‚Äôt working, and social media is now bubbling up the explanation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase told IGN: "It is not recommended to modify any game files, as doing so carries the risk of getting banned."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some have suggested mod makers may be able to issue workarounds for their creations, but as it stands Marvel Rivals is a mod-free game. And the crackdown perhaps comes as little surprise. NetEase generates revenue from the free-to-play hero shooter through the sale of premium skins. If modding threatens that revenue in any way, NetEase will have taken a dim view.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We‚Äôve seen a similar crackdown from other developers who sell premium skins for their games. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-bans-mods-from-public-servers-says-official-mod-tools-are-coming">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 developer Saber Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment at one point disabled mods for the game</a>, although later reversed its decision.
