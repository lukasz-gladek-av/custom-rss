"Instead, later this year a RE Remake that starts with "(C)" &amp; ends "(ode Veronica)" is going to be announced, I promise you."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil: Code Veronica originally launched in 2000 for the Sega Dreamcast, and while not a mainline numbered entry like Resident Evil 2, 3 or 4, it remains beloved by fans and considered a core part of the franchise's story. Its narrative takes place around the same time as Resident Evil 3, but instead features Claire and Chris Redfield on a remote prison island and then in Antarctica. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Resident Evil 5, speculation around a remake has bubbled up following a teasing comment by Eva La Dare, the voice actress behind that game's character Sheva Alomar. However, as of yet, Capcom is not believed to have greenlit any new version of the game — which garnered strong sales and a mostly positive reaction from fans back at its original launch in 2009. Whatever Alomar is referring to, it's likely not worth getting your hopes up.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, Capcom will reportedly finish remaking its early Resident Evil entries with a fresh version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-zero-hd">Resident Evil Zero</a>, due in 2028 after this year's Requiem and next year's new version of Code Veronica. (And after all that? Well, it would seem time for an all-new Resident Evil entry once again.) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, Capcom's under-wraps Resident Evil Zero remake appeared to pop up on the resume of Far Cry 5 and Guardians of the Galaxy video game actor Jon McLaren, with the suggestion that he will now be playing escaped convict Billy Coen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before all of that, of course, Resident Evil Requiem will arrive on February 27. Set to feature new character Grace Ashcroft and returning hero Leon S. Kennedy, the game's mix of survival horror and action looks hugely promising — even if <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-capcom-really-kill-leon-in-resident-evil-requiem-new-images-showing-a-mysterious-mark-on-his-neck-have-fans-worried">we're all a bit concerned by that nasty-looking bite on Leon's neck</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
