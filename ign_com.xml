            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a The Last of Us fan anxiously hoping for word that Naughty Dog is working on a Part 3 video game, I've got some bad news for you. Series creator Neil Druckmann has put a real damper today on any hopes that a Part 3 is in the works...or ever will be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to Variety</a>, Druckmann gave a lengthy interview today largely centered around The Last of Us TV series. However, at the end, the outlet asked him about the prospect of The Last of Us Part 3. Druckmann responded with quite the shut-down:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was waiting for this question,” he said, sighing. “I guess the only thing I would say is don’t bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us.’ This could be it.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the question remains as to if you believe Druckmann or not. Naughty Dog is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-heads-to-space-with-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-the-game-awards-2024">currently hard at work on Intergalactic</a>, which was announced at The Game Awards last December and is likely several years away from completion given its lack of any kind of release window. With the studio's interests firmly in space right now, there's no way the team has time for The Last of Us Part 3 anytime soon. It's entirely possible Druckmann is being coy here, or simply that he isn't willing to commit yet. The passage of time could change this response...or, he could just be done with it. Who can say!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if you're craving more of The Last of Us, there's still the television series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-release-date-confirmed">with the second season airing on April 13 on Max</a>. And while Druckmann says in the interview he isn't sure how many seasons it will take to wrap up the story of Part 2, an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-will-probably-run-for-4-seasons-hbo-exec-says">HBO executive hinted in February</a> that it's looking like four total seasons will be the sweet spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
