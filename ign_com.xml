There’s 3D audio, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keyboard and mouse control support includes new control customization options, including full control remapping, primary and secondary bindings for keyboard and mouse control, and an adaptive mode that allows players to combine keyboard and controller inputs. There’s full gamepad support, while DualSense controllers feature full haptic feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC offers a wide range of graphics settings and presets, to ensure the best possible experience on hardware ranging from high-end PCs to handheld gaming devices,” Sony said.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Last of Us Part 2 PC specs:</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/20/tlou-specs-1742492089994.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">TLOU 2 Remastered PC specs. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to No Return mode, two new characters are being added: The Last of Us Part I’s Bill and Marlene.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb from Sony:</p><blockquote>Like with each No Return combatant, these characters offer their own unique playstyles, and should offer both new and returning fans an exciting new opportunity to test their mettle. Bill is a “Smuggler” playstyle who can access a custom pump shotgun from dead drops, and receives double rewards from drops as well. He’s stronger against melee attacks but can’t dodge. Marlene, meanwhile, features a “Risk Taker” playstyle that includes a Custom Assault Rifle, “All or Nothing” gambits, can reroute her No Return path once per run, and more.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/20/54393525277-2ff5b3926b-o-1742492128554.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">New characters are coming to No Return mode. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Four new maps are coming to No Return, too.</p><blockquote>Overlook, which is set high above the city of Seattle and features plenty of verticality, is the memorable site of a Seraphites encounter in the campaign. School is, during the campaign, the abandoned elementary school in which Ellie and Dina face off against the W.L.F. Streets is set in the overgrown Seattle neighborhood of Hillcrest, while Nest will be familiar to players who have played as Abby through an Infected-infested building. We’ve been so overjoyed about the reaction to this mode since Part II Remastered debuted on PS5 last year, and we hope these new maps further offer more variability and thrills as players tackle new runs.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/20/54396469192-cc5a754825-h-1742492165310.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">No Return is set for four new maps.

But if you do log in to PSN, you get PlayStation overlay and PSN Trophies. As an extra incentive, Sony said those who sign in with their PSN account also get access to 50 in-game points to activate bonus features, as well as a new skin for Ellie featuring Jordan A. Mun’s jacket from Naughty Dog’s new PS5 game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/20/54394636943-89001e0b8f-o-1742492213413.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ellie has a new skin featuring Jordan A.

It’s included in the 2.0 patch and unlockable via in-game bonus points.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann shared more details about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet"><u>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</u></a>. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>interview</u></a> with Alex Garland, the writer of zombie movie 28 Days Later, Druckmann talked candidly about the development process, confirming Intergalactic has been in the works for four years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I joke about this with the team. We made a game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-2">The Last of Us 2</a>, we made certain creative decisions that got us a lot of hate. A lot of people love it, but a lot of people hate that game," Druckmann said, to which Garland joked: "Who gives a shit?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Exactly," Druckmann added. "But the joke is like, you know what, let's do something that people won't care as much about — let's make a game about faith and religion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which stars Tati Gabrielle as Jordan A. Mun, takes place in an alternate historical timeline and features a "pretty prominent religion" that has "changed and bastardized and evolved" over the years, Druckmann said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PC version of The Last of Us 2 Remastered arrives ahead of Season 2 of HBO's hit TV adaptation. Showrunners Druckmann and Craig Mazin have confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-theres-a-dramatic-reason-spores-are-back-for-the-last-of-us-season-2"><u>“spores are back” following their omission from Season 1</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/why-a-new-domain-discovery-is-getting-persona-4-fans-excited-for-a-possible-remake<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After the success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, it's easy to see why fans would hope for Atlus to move ahead to its next entry in the Persona series. Now, with the discovery of a domain registration, hopes that we'll see a Persona 4 remake are that much higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/ScrambledFaz/status/1902715312379752726" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber Faz</a>, a domain for "p4re.jp" was recently registered. While normally not something to get excited about, Faz noted that several years ago, "p3re.jp" was registered a few months before the official reveal of Persona 3 Reload.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>p4re. jp was registered a few hours ago.</p><p>2 years ago, p3re. jp was registered. 3 months later Persona 3 Reload was revealed <a href="https://t.co/FjuhAkr76q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/FjuhAkr76q</a></p></div>— Faz (@ScrambledFaz) <a href="https://twitter.com/ScrambledFaz/status/1902715312379752726?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Rumors of a Persona 4 remake have <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/persona-4-remake-reportedly-in-development-reliable-sega-leaker-wait-a-while/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swirled around the gaming sphere</a> for a while, but a domain does lend a bit more credence to the idea. Though it's not the only older game in the Persona series that could use a refresh — the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/24/persona-2-innocent-sin-review">Persona 2 duology</a>, in particular would be nice to see — Persona 4 and the enhanced Vita port <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-4-golden">Persona 4 Golden</a> do hold a special place in many RPG players' hearts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona 3 Reload <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review">successfully brought the PlayStation 2 classic to new audiences</a>, becoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-becomes-fastest-selling-game-in-atlus-history-with-1-million-sales">one of the fastest-selling games in Atlus history</a>. Add on the eminent popularity of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5 and its Royal edition</a>, and a Persona 4 remake would make a lot of sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, nothing's been confirmed or even teased yet on Atlus' side. While a domain registration certainly feels like it could be the canary in the Persona mines, we'll have to see if this pans out or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

One discovery seems to reveal a "hidden" mode enabling 60 frames per second, which is certainly cause for curiosity and speculation about what it could mean for the Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on <a href="https://x.com/masagratordev/status/1902517127187161128" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> (via <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-hidden-60-fps-mode/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wccftech</a>), modder MasaGratoR dug into the executable of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition and found what they called a "hidden 60 FPS mode." The modder said it seems to be implemented "only partially," since enabling it causes "weird issues."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">About Xenoblade Chronicles X:<br>- Dynamic resolution ranges: 504p-720p handheld, 760p-1080p docked<br>- Game's executable has hidden 60 FPS mode. It seems to be implemented only partially since enabling it causes weird issues. As a proof screen from function that sets UI speed, 1.0.1 <a href="https://t.co/Ag09YVQ7g1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Ag09YVQ7g1</a></p>— MasaGratoR (@masagratordev) <a href="https://twitter.com/masagratordev/status/1902517127187161128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">While it's not implemented in the game proper, the existence of this setting does spark some interesting questions. If it's not available, why is it in there? While some stray leftover code could be one answer, some speculation about what this could mean for the Switch 2 and existing Switch games is also easy to understand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has confirmed that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-officially-almost-fully-backward-compatible">Switch 2 will be <em>mostly </em>backward compatible</a>. The official reveal of its next console said that the console will play Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games, as well as Nintendo Switch games, with an asterisk that certain Nintendo Switch games "may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to imagine Xenoblade Chronicles X would be one of those asterisked games, but there is a question over whether existing Switch games would get enhanced on the next-gen console. There's no proof of that yet, just speculation over the usual trends of backward compatibility. It certainly makes the Switch 2 all the more interesting for existing Switch owners, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll hopefully learn more in just a few weeks, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-switch-2-nintendo-direct-now-has-a-time-as-well-as-a-date">Nintendo airs its Switch 2 Direct on April 2, 2025</a>. There, we'll learn more about the upcoming console and Nintendo's plans for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
