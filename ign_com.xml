            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark Studios has opened up about how it will make the second Expedition in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a> more enticing after the first left its community wanting more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer behind the popular sci-fi extraction shooter updated fans with <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/second-expedition-rewards-and-requirements" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a blog post</u></a> on its website. Included are a February 25 sign-up date and a March 1 departure date for the account reset event, as players are told to look forward to more worthwhile rewards before sending their beloved Raiders into the unknown and starting from scratch.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/image-16-1770326710755.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Arc Raiders Expedition Breakdown. Image courtesy of Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Stash value requirements were the first thing Embark addressed, telling fans that they’ll now need just 3 million coins to reach the maximum bonus of five skill points. That means you’ll need only 600,000 per point, a significantly more achievable task than the previous Expedition’s ask of 1 million per skill point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s more, Raiders who participated the first time around but didn’t amass enough coins can benefit from a new catch-up feature. Missed points can be claimed for 300,000 each, with coins first going toward Expedition 2 before being used for the makeup points for Expedition 1. In other words, you’ll need the 3 million for the five new skill points and an additional 300,000 per skill point missed. As Raiders jump into Expeditions for the first time, they’ll need to start by unlocking rewards from Expedition 1, leaving the catch-up feature only for returning players.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Other new permanent rewards for the second reset include a new Scrappy outfit, an evolved Patchwork outfit with more toggles and colors, and, thankfully, 12 more stash space slots. Returning expeditioners gain 5% more XP (10% total), a 6% boost to Scrappy materials (12% total), and a 10% increase to repair value (70% total).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of the upcoming changes to Expeditions arrive after Embark noted a somewhat disappointing reception to its first crack at the account wipe feature. Design director Virgil Watkins told <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/first-expedition-wipe-statistics" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCGamesN</a> last month that "a little over a million players" successfully cleared their accounts and suggested the studio would keep its ear to the ground going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We completely acknowledge that it isn't the most engaging thing to just go for money," he said at the time, "[and it has] the potential outcome of disincentivizing using your gear, which is kind of what people look forward to towards the end of a reset cycle. So yeah, we're looking at revisions on that."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 30, 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">AC League would have been a baseline for introducing cooperative play into the rest of the series.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has reportedly canceled a multiplayer, cooperative Assassin's Creed title that has been in development at French studio Ubisoft Annecy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a <a href="https://www.origami.ng/ubisoft-vantage-cancel-league-assassins-creed-multiplayer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report by French publication Origami</a>, which IGN has independently translated. According to the report, the project was codenamed "AC League", was originally conceived as a DLC for Assassin's Creed Shadows, and would have potentially taken place in the same feudal Japan era. The DLC would have involved four assassins joining forces to take on a series of scripted missions with up to four players that would have ultimately concluded the story told in the game's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion">(canceled) Season Pass</a>. You may have already heard of AC League if you pay close attention to Assassin's Creed gossip, as it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-september-release/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previously rumored last year in a report from Insider Gaming</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The project, Origami reports, was apparently fairly ambitious and was intended to serve as a baseline for future multiplayer features throughout the series, such as a return to a hybrid solo/multiplayer playstyle as existed in Assassin's Creed Unity or Black Flag (a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake">remake of which has been rumored for some time now</a>). However, as the AC League project progressed, directors at Ubisoft Annecy reportedly began to question whether it made sense to attach League to Shadows, as they worried it would take too long to make, and came up with a different plan that turned it into a small, standalone title borrowing pieces of the Assassin's Creed: Shadows open world. Development on this progressed with an intended invite-only alpha planned for May of 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, AC League was allegedly just the latest victim of the ongoing upheaval at Ubisoft. For several months now, the company has been undergoing a massive restructure alongside major cost-cutting measures, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure">canceling numerous projects</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shuts-down-assassins-creed-rebellion-developer-halifax-studio-just-weeks-after-it-unionized">closing studios</a>, and reorganizing its creative houses. It was to this restructuring that AC League fell victim, with leadership at Ubisoft Annecy being informed just last week that AC League was being canceled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, there is still a sliver of hope for the project, Origami reports. Apparently, a handful of Annecy employees have been selected to transfer the technical advancements the team made back into the company's proprietary Anvil engine, with the goal of eventually making it easier to add replayable multiplayer modes to future Assassin's Creed titles that would be less expensive to develop. Unfortunately, that leaves more than a quarter of the 270 individuals working at Annecy without a project at the moment, leaving a lot of lingering anxiety that layoffs may be coming next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has reached out to Ubisoft for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft's quarterly earnings will be reported next week, and all eyes are on the company to see if it can pull itself together amid some drastic financial times. Upon last reporting, the company had thrown out its previous fiscal year guidance for new, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure">significantly reduced financial expectations</a>, reflective of the fact that the company just closed two stories, laid off a lot of employees, and canceled six projects. It's also handed off its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-now-operated-by-vantage-studios-ubisoft-and-tencents-new-business-group-with-full-autonomy-on-creative-direction-and-business-plans">three biggest franchises to Vantage Studios</a>, a newly-created business entity owned by Ubisoft but with a 25% stake from Tencent to help keep the lights on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/new-fortnite-island-created-by-qatar-airways-gives-you-a-chance-to-win-weekly-flight-tickets</link>
            <guid>1427437</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new island just came to Fortnite that features a digital reimagining of Qatar’s capital city, Doha, as well as Hamad International Airport and a Qatar Airways aircraft. Called QVerse Island, it’s meant to give travelers an immersive way to experience the sights of the city and its airport. There are lots of minigames, a glimpse at some of the city’s unique architecture, and a hidden golden ticket that you can find for a chance to win a free Qatar Airways flight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can reach QVerse Island within Fortnite by searching for “QVerse” or using code 6020-0265-6735. When you arrive on the island, you’ll pull up to Hamad International Airport and get a look at the skyline of Doha with re-creations of its real-life skyscrapers. You’ll be greeted by Sama, Qatar Airways’ digital cabin crew member, who will give you five quests to complete.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/qverse-island-5-1765238045451.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After you’ve talked to her, you’re free to explore the city and do things in whatever order you choose. Right off the bat, you’ll see floating coins that give you 10 gold each. You can spend that gold at the airport vending machines for things like faster running speed, a jetpack that lets you double jump, or consumable items. You can also look for a hidden door that takes you inside the Business Class cabin of a Qatar Airways aircraft, where you’ll join other Fortnite characters as passengers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you exit the airport and make your way to the street, you’ll see you can summon a car with one button press, making traversal of the city quick and easy. Your HUD will have icons for the island’s biggest attractions, which is also where you can complete the quests Sama gave you. These are some of real-life Qatar’s most recognizable landmarks, like the National Museum of Qatar, West Bay, Katara Towers, and The Pearl Island. And QVerse Island has a persistent day/night cycle, so you can watch the sunset around these locations and see the whole city light up at night.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/qverse-island-4-1765238079743.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Each location has a minigame associated with it. At the National Museum of Qatar, you’re given a scavenger hunt to find five lost artifacts that lie scattered around the city. At West Bay, you can use your summoned car to complete a time trial race. At Katara Towers, you’ll need to cross between the towers, high in the air, while a rotating bar tries to knock you off. And at The Pearl Island, you can take on a parkour obstacle course that runs across the rooftops of the city.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you’re exploring, you’ll notice a timer counting down to the next departure. Once the countdown finishes, you’ll be transported to a multiplayer minigame with other people currently on the island. There are four minigames in all: Wild Wheels Safari, Neon City Drop, Jumpus Maximus, and Home Run Rush. For all four, the last person standing wins.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/qverse-island-2-1765238121119.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Wild Wheels Safari, you drive cars around a desert arena while floor tiles gradually fall away. If you fall into a hole, you’re eliminated. Neon City Drop is a similar concept, but you’re on foot and the floor is made up of brightly colored panels that fall away over time. Jumpus Maximus puts you on a giant spinning wheel in the air while rotating bars of different heights try to knock you off. And Home Run Rush gives everyone a superpowered baseball bat that can launch other players out of the stadium.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In between all the fun and games, you can explore QVerse Island to find the golden ticket. You’ll get an on-screen alert letting you know in what area of the map it just spawned, and then it’s up to you to find it.
