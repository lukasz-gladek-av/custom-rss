Right now, Woot! is offering a massive 2024 model <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yXDLJ?object_uuid=8ee95194-8944-4c8a-a85b-b4fd2ebcad92&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">83" Samsung S90D 4K OLED Smart TV</a> for only $2,499.99. This TV currently sells for $3,300 everywhere else, including Best Buy, Amazon, and Samsung. This is an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">excellent TV to pair with your PlayStation 5</a> or Xbox Series X. In fact, this TV could even be a better <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">gaming TV</a> than the LG C4. Although we haven't personally tested it, <a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/samsung/s90d-s90dd-oled-qd-oled" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RTINGS</a> says the S90D is brighter, has a wider color gamut, better color volume, wider viewing angle, and better HDR gradient handling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Woot! is owned by Amazon, so Amazon Prime members get free shipping on this order. If you're not a  Prime member, don't fret, because the shipping cost should only be $6. This is a brand-new unit with a full 1-year Samsung warranty.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">83" Samsung S90D 4K OLED Smart TV for $2,499.99</h2><div catalogid="9dc58cfd-1963-4628-85f6-eb4ddaff5e16" id="214897"><div id="214897" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Includes 1 Year of Samsung Warranty</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>83" Samsung S90D 4K OLED Smart TV</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Samsung S90D is the current 2024 model and is considered to be one of the best OLED TVs on the market, superior to even the LG C4. The S90C uses Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">OLED technology aside, the Samsung S90D also has all the features you'd want in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-for-gaming">gaming TV</a>. It has a native 120Hz panel that can be pushed to as high as 144Hz as well as four total HDMI 2.1 ports for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-high-end-4k-tv">running 4K</a> at 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. The S90D also supports variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode. This is an especially good complement to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-pro-review">Playstation 5 Pro</a> console that was just released.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Holding Out for 2025 OLED TVs? Here's What's New</h2></div><div catalogid="25eaa809-852c-43d3-8dc7-3b8edc57b9c2" id="213952"><div id="213952" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sign Up and Get $100 Credit With Your 2025 Samsung TV Preorder</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Samsung showcased several of its top models during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ces-2025-everything-announced">CES 2025</a>. At the moment, exact pricing for each model is unknown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oled-vs-qled">OLED</a> TVs - the S95F, S90F, and S85F - feature several incremental upgrades over its predecessors. The S95F, Samsung's flagship model, boasts a new NQ4 AI Gen 3 processor, a faster 165Hz refresh rate, an improved anti-glare coating, and an upgraded QD OLED panel that promises up to 2,000 nits of brightness. The S90F will also feature the Gen 3 processor, 144Hz refresh rate with VRR, and a QD OLED panel with up to 1,300 nits of brightness (for TV models 55" and up). The S85F remains the "budget" OLED TV with a Gen 2 processor.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">AI and Anti-Glare Tech Are the Highlights for Samsung</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside most companies in the industry, Samsung is going all in on AI. Samsung's new tech for 2025 is its "Vision AI", which can recognize the content you're watching, including specifics like the actors or setting, and display relevant personalized commentary in real-time. In addition, more TV models this year will be equipped with AI Upscaling Pro and AI Motion Enhancer Pro which work in tandem to optimize image quality on the fly. Other features include Active Voice Amplier Pro, which uses AI to isolate and enhance voices, AI Optimization, and AI Energy Mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Samsung is also decisively moving many of its TV panels to the matte-like anti-glare coating we saw on the S95D in 2024. This tech doesn't desaturate like we typically see with anti-glare coatings from other brands, and yet reflections are minimized to the point that you'll never notice them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more options, check out our picks for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-for-gaming">the best gaming TVs</a>. The LG C-series OLED TVs are good alternatives to this TV and usually more affordable (except for this particular example). The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lg-g4-4k-oled-tv-review">LG G-series TVs</a> are even better, but they command a huge price premium. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is still set for release in fall 2025, parent company Take-Two has insisted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reporting its third quarter ending December 31, 2024 financial results, the Rockstar owner listed GTA 6 for fall 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. It means that for now at least, GTA 6 is still on track for its previously announced release window and has not been delayed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN ahead of the release of its financial report, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said that while "there's always a risk of slippage," the company "feel really good about it [fall 2025]."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look, there's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things," Zelnick responded when IGN asked how confident he was that Rockstar will hit fall 2025 for GTA 6. "So we feel really good about it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked for an update on how development on GTA 6 is going, Zelnick kept his cards close to his chest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look, I think the game is eagerly anticipated both internally and externally," he said. "We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs. I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we're all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep. Our whole organization is super excited."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The GTA 6 release date is one of the hottest topics in all of entertainment, with rival publishers waiting with bated breath for Rockstar to make its announcement. Earlier this week, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-boss-willing-to-move-battlefield-release-date-to-account-for-nuanced-year-relative-to-competition-cough-gta-6-cough">he was willing to delay the new Battlefield</a> out of the next fiscal year depending on the release timing of its competitors’ games, a thinly veiled nod to the behemoth that is GTA 6.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While its release window remains firm, GTA 6's much-wanted Trailer 2 has yet to materialize. We're now over a year since Trailer 1's release, a gap that has caused plenty of feverish fan speculation. While you wait to find out, IGN has much more on GTA 6 to check out, including an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, Zelnick's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response"><u>coy response on whether GTA 6 is coming to PC</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking generally about Rockstar, Take-Two said Grand Theft Auto 5 has now sold-in an incredible 210 million units worldwide. GTA Online had a “strong” quarter, led by the Agents of Sabotage update. GTA+ memberships increased 10% year-over-year in the quarter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Dead Redemption 2, meanwhile, has sold-in more than 70 million copies. Take-Two noted it is currently seeing its highest level of concurrent players on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two has a busy 2025, with the just-released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> from Firaxis, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pga-tour-2k25">PGA Tour 2K25</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a> in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> in the summer, GTA 6 in the fall, and Gearbox’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> before year-end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are exceedingly optimistic about the commercial potential of our titles and believe that they will have a transformative effect on our business – and our industry – over the long term,” Take-Two said, before adding it remains “highly confident” it will achieve “sequential increases in, and record levels of, net bookings in fiscal 2026 and 2027.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
