            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">So far this Star Wars-flavored expansion is a bit cringey, but works surprisingly well.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Destiny has always been the “we’ve got Star Wars at home” looter shooter, and with Destiny 2: Renegades, Bungie has decided to lean into that directly with a crossover expansion. Weirdly enough, so far that decision seems to have kinda worked out alright! Renegades doesn’t solve many of Destiny 2’s longstanding issues, including the fact that it’s been awkwardly spinning its wheels for over a year now (reminiscent of the MCU post-Endgame), but embracing the cheesiness and over-the-top drama of Star Wars is at the very least a surprisingly nice change of pace in what has become quite a predictable universe. The story is silly, to be sure, but introduces a few new mechanics and weapon types that are a welcome change, and there’s an impressive level of enemy density throughout practically all of the activities that keeps the action interesting. I’ve still got a lot more questing and looting to do before my final review, but so far this expansion has been a pretty compelling breath of fresh air in a game I’ve otherwise been far less excited about than usual.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve read any of my previous expansion reviews (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/09/destiny-2-shadowkeep-review"><u>of</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-beyond-light-review"><u>which</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-witch-queen-review"><u>there</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-review"><u>are</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review"><u>a</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-review"><u>lot</u></a>), then you’ll already know I am one those weirdo Destiny fans who has stuck with this game through thick and thin – so it should mean something when I tell you that saying I am also a Star Wars fan would be such a massive understatement that I’m actually too embarrassed to elaborate further publicly. But even with my undying love of space wizards, I was initially mortified to learn Destiny 2 was planning a crossover with it. For me, it was the ultimate sign that Destiny was out of ideas, had gone “full Fortnite” in a way that seemed cheap and tacky, and was making one last desperation play during the slow death it’s been suffering for a number of years now. And, yeah, that all pretty much turned out to be true. But when I found myself watching two lightsaber-wielding foes square off in an epic cutscene while listening to the John Williams-esque music this expansion makes heavy use of, I’ll admit it won me over… at least a little.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Renegades does go out of its way to include every little Star Wars reference to a degree that can feel a bit forced – a crutch that’s continuously leaned upon in lieu of any original ideas. For example, you find yourself trapped in a garbage compactor during the very first mission, rescue someone from off-brand carbon freezing, and make a jump to lightspeed while a brooding, masked villain angrily watches you escape his grasp. It’s extremely on the nose stuff, and I was just as likely to experience a full-body cringe as I was to smile about it. But the complete “screw it” energy at play here as it full-throatedly embraces all the corniness and drama for which Star Wars is known does have a certain kind of refreshing charm that’s at least a distinct direction for Destiny 2. I’ve been complaining about this game feeling stale for at least five years now, so I’ve got to give Bungie a bit of credit for trying something new here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also a fair number of new mechanics that I wasn’t expecting, like a shielding system for certain enemies that forces you to deal a whole bunch of damage in a short span of time before you can actually hurt them, AT-ST-inspired walkers that have some unique attacks I wasn’t expecting, and even some new weapon types, like battery-powered guns that can be fired until they overheat and need to cool down. None of this is massively game-changing stuff, but they’re decent little tweaks to the sandbox that are welcome additions. Of course, there’s also a ton of stuff that hasn’t changed at all, and even while you’re facing off against a new kind of enemy in theory, you’ll still be fighting the same Cabal armored warriors and bony Thrall monstrosities you’ve been shooting for over a decade, which has made this feel like a cheap reskin at times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m still fairly early into my space opera journey (I haven’t even crafted my lightsaber yet!), so I have a whole lot more to play before I can definitively say where Renegades lands. But so far this expansion seems much better than I expected… though that’s partially because I expected very little. I’ll have much more to say once I’ve completed the campaign and begin to dive into the endgame activities. For Light and Life!</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Destiny Rankings</h3><p>TieGuyTravis ranks each Destiny expansion since the series's conception.</p></div></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-renegades-review]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1373446</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">For gamers of a certain age, Warhammer Quest is a name to conjure with. The original 1995 release was the premier <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">dungeon-crawler</a> of its day, a rare cooperative title in an age of head-to-head conflict games. Once it was out of print it became, and remains, highly collectable. But in 2016, publisher Games Workshop resurrected the brand with the well-received Silver Tower. Darkwater is the latest iteration, with a few new tweaks and a lot of new toys on board to try and uphold its considerable legacy.</p><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box">What’s in the Box</h2></p><div catalogid="5c848b5c-737b-48d3-b764-893eede8d035" id="233318"><div id="233318" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Warhammer Quest: Darkwater</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop is rightly known as the premier producer of plastic miniatures and, even by its own exalted standards, the range of figures included in this set are a little bit special. Six of them are heroes, the remainder are their enemies, servants of the noxious, squelchy plague god of the Warhammer universe, Nurgle. The Nurgle range has always been a terrible beauty, crammed with unpleasant details of open sores and drooling maws and there’s plenty of that on display here. But what makes these stand out is a sense of character, something that’s often missing in modern, dynamically posed figures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These pop out of your tabletop with an air of individuality, particularly the heroes who display a fine mix of old-school adventurer alongside the current sensibilities of GW’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-dominion-review">Age of Sigmar</a> setting. Facial expressions and poses seem to tell you something about each of them, from the dour scowl of mercenary Bren Tylis to the gloating grin of the central villain, Gelgus Pust. And it’s worth noting for less experienced modellers that the box’s claim of push-fit is largely true. Most of the figures are fairly easy to assemble, although a couple will benefit from a drop of polystyrene cement. Painting them is another matter, however, as the level of detail may be a bit daunting for novices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of the miniatures, GW boxed games often skimp on the remainder of the components. That’s not the case here: this is a lavish production at every level, and you can see where the considerable asking price has been spent. Once you’ve lifted the figure sprues out of the box, the cards and punch-out tokens have their own carefully packed sub-box, with the cards for each of the game’s campaign acts presented in their own sealed envelopes. Although the cards could use more, and more varied, artwork, they’re sturdy, shiny and clear to read.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"This is a lavish production at every level."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Most surprising of all is the book of maps that are used in the skirmish scenarios that make up most of the game. While this is hardly a new idea, most examples are clunky and spiral-bound. This one is hard-bound, yet it still lies flat, making it an absolute pleasure to use. And the maps within are full of the kind of detailed art that we should also have seen on the cards, effectively evoking the plague-corrupted environments of the game’s setting, the Jade Abbey. More detail on the setting and narrative are provided in the game’s rulebook, offering up a great foretaste of the adventures to come.</p></div><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How It Plays</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251119-195821015-mp-1764789085874.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer Quest: Darkwater is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a>, but you’ll play with four heroes in every game, so it’s best with two or four players: solo is possible, but you’ll end up juggling a lot as the campaign progresses. It has two game modes, a one-off skirmish fight or a longer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign game</a>. The focus is definitely on the latter mode, as single fights can be unbalanced depending on the scenario you end up playing, and you don’t get the fun of slowly building up your characters and revealing your own narrative of attempting to free the Jade Abbey from Nurgle’s putrefaction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A campaign consists of three acts, each of which sees you dealing out 14 random encounter cards from that act’s deck, with a boss card beneath. You then get a choice of two possible encounter cards for each adventure, and this is an important decision. Many of the encounters aren’t skirmish fights but little narrative snippets or mini-games. Most of these are of the push your luck or risk versus reward variety, but there are a couple of the more imaginative designs that made Silver Tower’s scenarios such a pleasure.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251119-200931912-1764789104928.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to battle scenarios, it’s important to read the cards carefully and consider how the fight might play out. They offer a variety of maps, of enemies to fight, sidequests, victory conditions and special rules. These cause them to vary wildly in difficulty, and some can be almost impossible if you haven’t found certain rewards for your party. This is a big deal because the price for failure is high: you lose some rewards and get to try again, with a second fail ending the campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Duking it out on the map is based on a set of rules from another game in the series, Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QrAron?object_uuid=38ddcc60-bd01-4ab2-acfc-c334713f18e4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>). Each hero has three action cards: move, attack, and aid. Using one requires you to expend energy, which is most commonly obtained by exhausting one of said cards, either for the action you’re taking or one of the others. Essentially this boils down to heroes taking three actions each turn, which can be any combination of the available options, although some of the rewards you can get later in the campaign complicate the picture a little.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat involves you rolling dice, almost always a pair, hoping to achieve a target number depending on what you’re fighting. Many enemies have a defense value that cancels out an equal number of hits, meaning you’ll have to hit on both dice to hurt them. Between the probabilities involved and the flexibility of the action system, this provides a satisfying balance of decision-making and randomness. This is not a deep game by any means, but you’ll often be torn as to how to best distribute your actions, while the turn limit on completing each battle can lead to some thrilling, high-stakes rolls towards the close.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251119-202234130-mp-1764789122637.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Between each hero’s turn, the monsters get to activate. How they behave depends on a dice roll, and most enemies switch between a sedate black die and a more threatening red die with each passing battle round. Mostly they’ll move toward a target at variable speed and try to attack, although all the monsters also have a special effect: horrible little pox-wretches spawn new companions, while the tough daemonic cankerborn blast all nearby heroes with an area effect attack. This roll can have a major impact on the difficulty of a scenario, as monsters sometimes do nothing and sometimes unleash a terrifying onslaught, a quirk that the rules put down to their chaotic nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One flaw in this system and the map design is that most of the boards have one or more choke points caused by impassable hexes, and most of the scenarios require players to get somewhere and do something in order to win. The result is that both players and monsters get funneled toward the tight corners and scenarios can bog down in repeated roll-offs until you either clear the enemies or the time runs out. Some character abilities and items can bypass this – the dwarf ranger Drolf Ironhead can move through the odd impassable hex – but while this gives some scenarios the feel of a spatial puzzle, in others having one or two characters get a shortcut doesn’t make much difference to achieving the goal. This issue also causes a sense of repetition, despite the fairly varied scenario design.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251124-194023242-1764789139244.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Victory, and the completion of sidequest goals, results in reward cards being doled out to the adventurers. Like the scenarios themselves these vary in power, with better items being available later in the campaign, but the more impressive items are often one-shot, while more minor power-ups can be re-used. They all add more tactical options to battles, which is absolutely a good thing. Weighing up whether or not to throw your magical one-off widget into the mix in an attempt to save a scenario that’s going south is always a knife-edge decision and adds extra frisson to the dice-rolls that usually result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even on-board battle scenarios only last about 30 minutes so, when you mix in the much shorter mini-game encounters, playing through an act doesn’t take all that long. “Saving” the game state between sessions is a minor pain but perfectly possible. All the adventure cards have their own text preamble to set the scene and, as you progress through the campaign, there are secrets to uncover and some new playable characters to unlock. The unfolding narrative isn’t going to win any literary awards but it’s effective at giving your playthrough a solid storybook backbone. Nurgle is a particularly fun opponent to tackle, his servitors by turns fatherly and feculent, so freeing the once-pristine Jade Abbey from their clutches feels like a worthy goal.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251128-113953298-1764789159676.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QOgmxY?object_uuid=38ddcc60-bd01-4ab2-acfc-c334713f18e4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Warhammer</a>  </li></ul></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 4, 2025 6:13 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Compared to the long grind that characterized the last Warhammer Quest game, Cursed City, Warhammer Quest: Darkwater feels like a breath of fresh air. It’s faster, lighter and more approachable, and is very much a coherent miniatures game rather than a box of cool figures with some rules thrown in as an afterthought. Despite the cracking production quality, this won’t win over any GW naysayers: play is still very random and the difficulty is uneven. But the unfolding tale is compelling nevertheless, with enough decision making to engage your neurons and plenty of exciting moments. Fundamentally, whether you’re willing to pay the considerable asking price on this package likely boils down to how much you want the amazing miniatures. But if you do invest, you’ll find that it can capably stand toe-to-toe with a lot of modern dungeon crawl designs.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-quest-darkwater-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Left 4 Dead was one of our early inspirations"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you love PvE co-op games but murderous robots are giving you low level PTSD, Cast Outs is here to stir up the genre with a modern take on fantasy. Designed from the ground up for co-op, it takes the usual Dungeons &amp; Dragons tropes of goblins, elves and magic spells, and turns them into a 2-4 player playground to battle in. It's got pedigree too, because while it's the first game from UK studio Twisted Works, that studio is home to veterans who have worked on games like Horizon Forbidden Resident Evil 7, Killzone, and the Total War series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Left 4 Dead was one of our early inspirations as one of those games where you had to just realize that you're not going to do this alone," explains James Brace, Twisted Works CEO and the Cast Outs Creative Director.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There is no single player mode. As a studio, when we approached this game we wanted a very sharp, narrow focus on this genre of co-op combat. As a team, you get to experience a whole bunch of missions and modes, different ways to play. We have runs, not unlike the Left 4 Dead kind of experience, but we also have sandbox areas, we have Horde modes. It balances everything we loved about scripted elements - those cinematic wow moments that we love in games like Left 4 Dead - with these playgrounds that allow a lot more freedom of exploration, and a lot more emergent gameplay."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fantasy Co-op Cast Outs First Look</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As one of a team of three refugees from a doomed realm in another dimension, the aim for you and two battle buddies is to fight through a fantastical version of modern day London with a mix of team combos, magical powers and parkour style agility. Talking to the teams there's clearly a lot of thought that's gone into the story - with references to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie, Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Percy Jackson referenced as team favorites, but the focus is also one letting players create their own weird and wonderful Tiktok share worthy moments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're going to have a lot of visual storytelling, what I call passive storytelling. It's there in the world. You can see it. You can absorb at your pace. It can come through the characters. We can have a lot of lore come through the characters like we've seen in a lot of roster based games, but in terms of your adventure, your run, that's your story. The first kind of thing we wanted to try and do is make sure there's enough dynamics in the experience to create unique stories," says Brace. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of gameplay, Cast Outs is built with short sessions in mind, but adds a progression system to keep you coming back for more. As well as learning your particular preferred combination of magic and run-based, Roguelike lite upgrade systems, there will be cosmetics to show off your Cast Outs skills and tenure, and a charm system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While playing, you're collecting ingredients. Those ingredients can be crafted into charms - it's where some of the magic still exists in London from the people who came over - and you can wear these charms and take them into battle," says Brace. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You're going to have charm slots so you're going to have dilemmas about how many charms you're going to take in. I'll be going, 'Oh what are you carrying in? I'm taking this.' And it's ultimately driving the progression system to get all the charms and to have the most flexibility on play styles. You'll be able to support your team with charms. A lot of our charms aren't individual. They're helping the team more like perks and buffs for the group. I think people are going to like them because it enables you to um, take the classes and turn your tank into a bit more like a support tank or a bit more DPS."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Planned for release on PC, PS5 and Xbox with crossplay, there's no release date yet, but the Twisted Works team is big on playtesting and building its community to help shape the game. Check out the studio's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/tBNw5AnRt7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Discord</u></a> to find out more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're still shocked that through our play testing that players are telling us about and showing us new ways to play with our own magic that we never thought of, which is absolutely fantastic."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial. She's been a professional nerd since 2006 when she got her start on Official PlayStation Magazine in the UK, and has since worked for GamesIndustry.Biz, Rolling Stone and GamesRadar.
