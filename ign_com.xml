Timed Research, meanwhile, will offer up a Varoom — the engine-like Pokémon. Plus, of course, you get to look at the big red Pokémon Go truck.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Across the host city, other bonuses will be activated — including 3-hour lures and up to 5 Special Trades per day. Nationwide, meanwhile, Timed Research advertising the upcoming arrival of the Road Trip will award the same summer costumed Pikachu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Pokémon Go announced an unprecedented $20 event pass featuring the game's first Golden Bottle Cap item — something that will allow players to increase a Pokémon's stats until they are a rare 100%. Ahead of the item's introduction, fans expressed concern the feature could see the game straying into pay-to-win territory, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-developer-addresses-pay-to-win-fears-as-it-introduces-unprecedented-20-premium-pass-with-gold-bottle-cap-that-boosts-a-pokmons-stats-to-100">something director Michael Steranka discussed at length in our exclusive interview</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Separately, IGN also chatted with Steranka about this year's biggest change — that Pokémon Go is now owned by Monopoly Go! maker Scopely, a company backed by the Saudi-founded Savvy Games. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-director-talks-new-ownership-says-saudi-backing-wont-see-demands-such-as-cristiano-ronaldo-added-to-the-game-yeah-thats-a-little-bit-not-our-vibe">How will the change impact the game?</a> IGN put that question to Steranka as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
