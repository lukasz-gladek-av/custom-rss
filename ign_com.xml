If you’re playing Black Ops 6 Multiplayer during Season 1 you’ll have no-doubt spotted these outlandish visual effects out in the battlefield.

As of November 24, Helldivers 2 for PlayStation 5 is marked down to just $29.99. That’s 25% off the usual $39.99 price tag, meaning you’ll save $10 while signing up to save humanity.</p><div catalogid="f92732a8-eb2f-4b10-a7ab-8caafdd155f8" id="211656"><div id="211656" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hell Divers 2 - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in the not-so-friendly expanse of the galaxy, Helldivers 2 lets you join squads of up to four players to take on equally thrilling and chaotic missions. You’ll face swarms of alien enemies, customize your loadouts to rain down destruction, and wrestle with the constant danger of friendly fire (hey, accidents happen). With gameplay that’s fast, ferocious, and just a bit bonkers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you prefer to sneak through enemy territory or go full Rambo with explosions galore, Helldivers 2 has you covered. The game’s loadout options let you tailor your approach to combat and possibly earn some bragging rights along the way. (Try not to “accidentally” take out your squad mates with a misplaced grenade. We’ve all been there.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Friday is the perfect excuse to add this gem to your PS5 collection. The $29.99 price tag makes it one of the better deals we’ve seen for a highly rated recently released game. Whether you’re playing solo or coordinating mayhem with friends, Helldivers 2 promises endless hours of galactic carnage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review">Our review for Helldivers 2 scored a 9/10</a> as a multiplayer breath of fresh air: "Helldivers 2's combat feels fantastic, its missions stay fresh and interesting, and its smart progression system doesn’t nickel and dime you."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But like any good Black Friday deal, this one won’t last forever. Head to Target before your chance to save $10 blasts off into space.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Nov 25, 2024 4:25 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
