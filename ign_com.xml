Today, both The Sims 1 and The Sims 2 are available on PC once again via two Legacy Collections and The Sims 25th Birthday Bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has announced that it's releasing The Sims: Legacy Collection and The Sims 2: Legacy Collection today on PC. The two are available separately as well as combined for $40 in The Sims 25th Birthday Bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both games include all expansions and <em>almost</em> all stuff packs, as it looks like The Sims 2: Legacy Collection is missing the IKEA Home Stuff pack from 2008. But otherwise, everything's there. In fact, both collections include some bonus content, with The Sims 1 getting something called Throwback Fit Kit and The Sims 2 receiving a Grunge Revival Kit on top of all the other add-ons.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA's re-release of the two older The Sims games marks the first time in over a decade that both gave have been readily available to play. The Sims 1 was only ever released on disc, so for years now unless you were able to track down an old physical copy and somehow make it run on a modern Windows machine, there was just no way to get ahold of it (and that doesn't even include the expansion packs!). The Sims 2 was available more recently in 2014 via an Ultimate Collection on EA's Origin store, but the Ultimate Collection was taken down a while ago. So unless you took advantage of it at the time, The Sims 2 remained unavailable to you unless you could similarly find a physical disc. With these two new collections, all four The Sims games are now easily purchaseable and playable again through digital storefronts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/05/the-sims-6">The Sims 1 a 9.5/10</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/10/28/the-sims-2-2">The Sims 2 an 8.5/10</a> waaaaay back in the day when we first reviewed them both. While the series has added numerous new features and ironed out a lot of kinks since then, the originals are still worth checking out for their goofiness, relative simplicity, challenge, and legacy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sims: Legacy Collection and The Sims 2: Legacy Collection are both available now on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and through the EA app.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-bloodborne-60fps-patch-says-sony-has-sent-him-a-dmca-takedown-but-why-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The creator of the high-profile Bloodborne 60fps patch has said he’s received a DMCA takedown from Sony.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lance-mcdonald-hacker-story-pt-god-of-war-bloodborne">Well-known video game tinkerer Lance McDonald</a> announced the news in a <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1885347693125566806" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, saying he received a takedown notification on behalf of Sony Interactive Entertainment “asking that I remove links to the patch I posted on the internet, so I've now done so.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McDonald then pointed to one of his <a href="https://youtu.be/i0tqppZDYxw?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube videos</a> on the Bloodborne 60fps patch, which he released in 2021, and recounted a meeting with former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida in which he mentioned he made the 60fps mod for Bloodborne.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I met @yosp and said to him ‘I make mods for PlayStation games’ and he said ‘oh!.’ And I said ‘I made the 60fps mod for Bloodborne’ and he laughed so hard.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodborne is of course one of the biggest conundrums in the video game industry. The FromSoftware masterpiece launched on PS4 to critical and commercial acclaim, but since then Sony hasn’t touched it. Fans are desperate for an official next-gen patch that would make the game run at 60fps, up from 30fps, but there are also calls for a remaster and a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That leaves it to the likes of McDonald to plug the gap. But more recently, fans managed to get PS4 emulators to deliver something akin to a remaster on PC. The tech experts at <a href="https://youtu.be/-zjzBbdl7hk?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry released a video</a> covering “a breakthrough in PS4 emulation” via ShadPS4, which means Bloodborne is now fully playable start to finish in 60fps. Could this breakthrough have triggered an aggressive response from Sony? IGN has asked Sony for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hasnt-sony-done-anything-more-with-bloodborne-playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-personal-theory">Yoshida delivered his Bloodborne no-show theory</a> in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an interview with Kinda Funny Games</u></a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing,” Yoshida began. “And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is Bloodborne remains dormant nearly 10 years after the first game came out. But is there hope? In interviews, Miyazaki often deflects questions about Bloodborne, pointing to the fact FromSoftware does not own the IP. But in February last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5"><u>Miyazaki at least admitted the game would benefit from a release on more modern hardware</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
