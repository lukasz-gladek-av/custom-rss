            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-day-broadcast-bethesda-reveals-what-it-has-planned-for-the-show">Fallout Day upon us</a> and rumors swirling around remakes, remasters, and even new games in the famous post-apocalyptic role-playing series, one Hollywood star has made his thoughts crystal clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That star is Danny Trejo, whose appearances in the likes of From Dusk till Dawn, Con Air, and Spy Kids made him a cult figure. But he’s intimately familiar with Fallout, too, having played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/fallout-new-vegas/Raul_Tejada">Raul Alfonso Tejada</a>, a Ghoul companion, in the much-loved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it stands to reason that Trejo would, like so many fans, love to see Fallout: New Vegas return in some fashion. Responding to Bethesda’s official Instagram post on what to expect from Fallout Day, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fallout/p/DQHdlH_jQeS/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trejo said</a>: “Remaster New Vegas boss!” alongside a fire emoji. Trejo has 3.1 million followers on Instagram, so his comment will be heard loud across the social network.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, a Fallout: New Vegas remaster was not on Bethesda’s official list of games set to appear during its Fallout Day broadcast, which is set for 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UK today, October 23. Specifically on Fallout 76, Bethesda will show more of the Burning Springs update. This big expansion, due out in December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walton-goggins-is-set-to-play-the-ghoul-from-the-fallout-tv-show-in-fallout-76-but-how-does-the-character-fit-in-the-fallout-76-timeline"><u>sees Walton Goggins reprise his fan-favorite role as The Ghoul from the Fallout TV show</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout Shelter is also mentioned, as is Fallout 4 and Creations, which suggests the decade old role-playing game will get some new content soon. Creations are community created mods released officially for Bethesda’s video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, there are new merch drops, community in-person events, and a post-show celebrating the community. There is no specific mention of the Fallout TV show, either. with Season 2 due out in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are all sorts of rumors floating around about potential Fallout remakes now that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is out the door (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>Fallout 3 Remastered was leaked back in 2023</u></a>, but those plans may have changed). And we know Bethesda plans to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5"><u>Fallout 5</u></a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last we heard on Fallout 5, by the way, was back in June 2024, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success"><u>Bethesda Softworks head Todd Howard said he wasn’t interested in rushing it out the door</u></a>. Howard opened up about the future of the hit post-apocalyptic RPG series during <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?si=Ua6SywsuPtdIr0yv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an interview with YouTube content creator MrMattyPlays</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For other Fallout games in the future, you know, obviously I can’t talk about those right now, but I would say, sort of rushing through them, or we kind of need to get stuff out that is different than the work we’re doing in 76… we don’t feel like we need to rush any of that," he said. "The Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and storytelling."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which was released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76. While fans slowly flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG, it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series leveled up in terms of attention.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/gettyimages-2230689584-1761216214306.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Danny Trejo wants Bethesda to remaster Fallout: New Vegas. Photo by Alberto Rodriguez/Variety via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Howard wouldn't budge when it came to desires for a substantial video game release. For him, it comes down to wanting to treat Bethesda's franchises with care.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Totally get the desire for a new kind of mainline single-player game," he said. "And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or now Starfield, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps Danny Trejo should have a word?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> developer Arrowhead has released the Into the Unjust: 4.1.0 update, which it said is designed to make the game “feel better to play.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This much anticipated update overhauls how Arrowhead approaches patching “to better target the pain points you’ve shared with us.” The studio said that means “more focus on stability, balance, and the issues that affect your experience the most.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over 200 bugs have been fixed, along with key balance updates and quality-of-life improvements. Arrowhead said that while new features are coming, this patch marks “a big step forward: both in the game itself and in how we work to improve it.” More refinements are already underway, the studio continued.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of balance, the overall effectiveness of primary weapons, sidearms, throwables, and stratagems is increased. SMGs and pistols, for example, have been adjusted to emphasize their role as close-quarters weapons, with increased close-range damage and increased damage falloff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting changes are made to enemies across the board. The Dragon Roach, for example, has seen its spawn rate decreased, and destruction of the wings now results in instant death. Each wing has a health pool, and the Dragon Roach should be more susceptible to explosions because even if you hit the body you now also hit the wings and do more damage. Overall, there should be fewer Dragon Roaches and they should be easier to take down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out the patch notes, courtesy of the Helldivers 2 Discord, below:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Helldivers 2 Into the Unjust: 4.1.0 patch notes:</h2><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Balancing</strong></h2><h2 data-cy="title2">General changes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Primaries, Sidearms, Throwables, and Stratagems</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Improvements have been made to increase the overall effectiveness of primary weapons, sidearms, throwables, and stratagems</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Light vs. Medium Penetration Weapons</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Light and medium penetration weapons now offer more distinct advantages.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Light penetration weapons generally deal a higher percentage of their total damage against durable enemies, differentiating them more clearly from medium penetration options</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>SMGs and Pistols</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>SMGs and pistols have been adjusted to emphasize their role as close-quarters weapons.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Yes, even Limit Break.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-best-sellers"><u>Magic The Gathering’s Final Fantasy set</u></a> in June <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-expansion-made-200-million-in-just-one-day"><u>set new records for the franchise</u></a>, and given the popularity of Commander, we’d imagine <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers"><u>plenty of the four decks included in the set</u></a> were shifted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trouble is, there’s always been a discrepancy in price, with the Final Fantasy 6 deck ‘Revival Trance’ going for much less, Final Fantasy 7’s ‘Limit Break’ going for much more, and the other two falling somewhere in between.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Best Buy’s answer? Discounting them all to the same price.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Best Buy Has Every Final Fantasy Magic Deck Under MSRP</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the positive side, this means you can get <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqRRg3?object_uuid=6da17790-8daa-406f-81b6-60b5a8853eff&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Limit Break</u></a>, a deck that regularly sells for much more than its MSRP, for $48.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a very fun deck that’s themed around equipment and dealing combat damage, and will no doubt be an easy pickup for anyone who waited for a discount.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the downside, <a href="https://zdcs.link/98PP6v?object_uuid=6da17790-8daa-406f-81b6-60b5a8853eff&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>that means Revival Trance is also $48.99</u></a>. It’s under MSRP, sure, but this deck’s messy game plan and lack of big reprints mean you can snap it up for around $35 elsewhere if you keep an eye out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out the quartet, I’ve been having more fun with Scions and Spellcraft recently, the Final Fantasy 14 deck helmed by Y’Shtola. It’s all about pinging opponents around the table for damage, which isn’t something you often get in a blue/white/black deck. <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEJJdX?object_uuid=6da17790-8daa-406f-81b6-60b5a8853eff&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>It’s $48.99 now</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, arguably the best deck from the set, Counter Blitz is helmed by Final Fantasy X’s Tidus and Yuna, and lets you manipulate counters to deal big damage or keep Summons around longer. And, guess what? <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YMMj4?object_uuid=6da17790-8daa-406f-81b6-60b5a8853eff&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>It’s $48.99 now, too</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each deck also comes with a ‘Collector Booster Sample Pack’ which includes two cards in foil or borderless treatment, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.<br>
