            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last night's Sony State of Play broadcast ended with an announcement and shadow drop for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta">God of War Sons of Sparta</a>, a side-scrolling spin-off listed as having 1-2 player support via the PlayStation Store. The only problem? Fans can't find its two-player option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early reports from those who've paid the game's $29.99 asking price and revisited Kratos' origins say that his sibling Deimos only appears at certain points, there's no two-player option in the game's menus, and plugging in a second PS5 controller doesn't provide extra options. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an odd situation that's led some to suspect the PlayStation Store <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012744" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">listing</a> is simply incorrect — as it appears to be the only firm evidence a two-player mode exists — and seek help from others online also searching for its multiplayer.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/screenshot-2026-02-13-130432-1770993202798.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">God of War Sons of Sparta, listed for 1-2 players. Image credit: PlayStation/IGN</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Writing on reddit and social media, fans say the store's listing didn't initially seem odd — since the game's title is "Sons of Sparta" plural, in-game footage shows the two brothers killing bosses together, and its cover artwork focuses on them fighting side-by-side. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's store description could also be ready ambiguously, referencing the exploits of both brothers: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Experience an untold chapter in Kratos' journey set during the harsh years of Spartan training alongside his brother Deimos," Sons of Sparta's official blurb reads. "Through endless trials, their minds, bodies, and hearts have been molded to become Spartan soldiers for whom duty and honor mean everything. After a fellow cadet goes missing, Kratos and Deimos vow to find him and embark on an adventure that will put their training and Spartan spirit to the test."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Just got it installed and running," wrote God of War fan Mephistocheles on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r38od8/god_of_war_sons_of_sparta_metroidvania_announced/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, in a lengthy thread with much discussion on the game's lack of co-op play. "So far it's not allowing drop in play on 2nd controller and there were no two-player options on start menu. Will update if I find it does allow co-op, but it doesn't look like it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I’m so sad," wrote bob_th4_build3r. "I bought it instantly because i thought it would be co-op… maybe they will add it in the future?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other comments say they are now escalating the matter to PlayStation's customer support, while several fans say they have tried to request refunds. IGN has contacted PlayStation and Sons of Sparta developer Mega Cat Studios for clarification on the game's two-player capabilities, or lack thereof.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony's State of Play show also included the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-side-scrolling-spin-off-out-today-and-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-announced-sony-state-of-play">surprise announcement of a God of War Trilogy Remake</a>, though work on the project at Sony Santa Monica is still in its early stages.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“Even if Zero Parades sells four billion copies, I hope we are wise enough to stay true to our core sensibilities.”</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer ZA/UM may have had a significant hit with 2019’s Disco Elysium, but it remains a reasonably small studio. And, at least as far as writer and VO director Jim Ashilevi is concerned, that’s how things should remain. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I hope we'll never become a triple-A studio,” he said during a recent interview with IGN. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">ZA/UM currently employs just under 100 members of staff, many of whom work remotely from different places across the world. Its has offices in Tallinn, Estonia; London, UK; and Porto, Portugal, and the company remains independently owned. While this is admittedly a bigger outfit than many indie developers enjoy, it’s still small-scale. And that’s how Ashilevi likes it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think we're always deeply encouraged and inspired by the indie scene because that's where the fresh ideas come from,” he said. “The avant-garde stuff always happens on the fringes, and I hope we'll never become a triple-A studio. Honestly, even if Zero Parades sells four billion copies, I hope we are wise enough to stay true to our core sensibilities and values as artists and storytellers.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of that conversation, Ashilevi offered his assessment of the gaming landscape. “I think it's grim out there,” he said. “I think the industry is in a really rough place. We all know that. But I don't think the industry is in a rough place creatively. I think, in a way, it's better than ever. It's better than ever before because anyone can make a game that touches the hearts of hundreds of millions of people.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The comment came in reference to the success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which, while developed on a much higher budget than any of ZA/UM’s projects, was 2025’s demonstration that there’s an enormous appetite for single-player, story-led games produced outside of the mega-publishers’ circles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the industry has become less gatekeep-y in a way,” he said. “But that also presents another problem, which is how do you even begin to promote your game, or make sure that it actually finds its audience? I think really the only thing you can control is whether you're staying true to your own vision and your own voice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we explored earlier this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/power-comic-books-and-zero-parades-for-dead-spies-how-zaum-found-its-disco-elysium-successor"><u>that vision has been ZA/UM’s “North Star” when it comes to Zero Parades</u></a>. “For that reason, I'm already really proud and happy with what we've done,” says Ashilevi. “It's like the response coming from the players – which will hopefully be positive, mostly positive – is almost just a bonus at this point. The real value I got out of it as a storyteller was just getting to know my friends and colleagues a little better and getting to know more about what goes on in their hearts and minds and souls.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from ZA/UM, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zero-parades-and-disco-elysium-developer-zaum-on-ai-we-dont-use-it">the studio’s stance on using AI</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zaums-new-rpg-is-similar-to-disco-elysium-because-were-still-the-same-people">why its new RPG resembles Disco Elysium so closely</a>.
