This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday">Black Friday</a>, you can snag the game on PS5 or Xbox at Amazon and <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5bop5?object_uuid=4a32bc06-3c0a-4818-9864-a9d6c149f732&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Best Buy for just $19.99</a>, down from its usual $59.99 price. That’s a $40 discount on a game that puts you in the pilot seat of a customizable mech for some of the most intense action of the year.</p><div catalogid="a65b745d-a927-4222-a0e6-74150d923461" id="211426"><div id="211426" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Drawing from the expertise behind Dark Souls and Elden Ring, Armored Core VI offers a dynamic gameplay experience that combines 3D maneuverability with a mix of ranged and melee combat. It’s like they took FromSoftware’s signature challenge and sprinkled in some explosive mech mayhem, because why not?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game’s story sends you to Rubicon 3, a contaminated wasteland where corporations and resistance groups are locked in a brutal battle to control a mysterious, catastrophic energy source. As a mercenary caught in the middle, it’s up to you to outfit your mech with the perfect loadout and dive into missions that require brains, brawn, and a little button-mashing finesse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Armored Core VI, it’s not just about blowing things up (though there’s plenty of that). The customization options let you create a mech that reflects your playstyle, whether precision strikes from afar or close-quarters carnage. Add a visually stunning world and epic boss battles, and you’ve got a recipe for hours of adrenaline-fueled fun. Let's not forget Armoured Core being pretty much a Soulsborne franchise but with mechs, so get good!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve been itching to join the mech party, now’s your chance. At $19.99 you’re not just saving $40, you’re scoring a ticket to one of the most exciting games in the genre. Don’t wait too long, though.

If you’ve been holding off on picking up Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, now is a good time to grab a copy: It’s on sale for a new all-time low price at Amazon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can snag it on PS5 or Xbox Series X for <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6bZrR?object_uuid=2c452c66-7f3e-4ca7-9d85-9c2498dc4de6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$49.99 at Amazon</a>, a healthy $20 discount.

I loved it, though, giving it an 8 out of 10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the summary: “Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a terrific third-person shooter with a compelling story, loads of weapons that are a blast to use, and a healthy variety of enemies to use them on. It once again borrows many of its ideas from the Gears of War series, but they’re good ideas, and Space Marine 2 does a fine job of making them its own. And while the Operations PvE mode that accompanies it doesn’t currently offer enough to keep me coming back, the deep customization options for your Space Marine do look promising if it’s supported in post-launch updates as planned. Besides, when you’re eviscerating aliens on planets as pretty as these, it’s hard not to leave satisfied. “</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Black Friday Game Deals We've Found So Far</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">For more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday discounts</a>, check out our roundups of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024">PS5 deals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-black-friday-2024">Xbox deals</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-black-friday-sale-2024">Nintendo Switch deals</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

Usually priced at $98, it's now available for $49. The membership includes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-walmart-plus">several perks</a>, starting with 5-hour early access to Walmart's next round of Black Friday deals, which begins at noon ET on Monday, November 25, and notably includes that Tears of the Kingdom deal for $29.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not worth signing up for Walmart+ just to snag that single deal—you’d likely be better off purchasing the game at its regular price. Instead, consider whether early access to Walmart’s upcoming deals or the other benefits of a 12-month membership make sense for you.
