Even without those juggernauts, games like Monster Hunter Wilds and Assassin's Creed Shadows have already set the tone for what should be another great year for new games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through the first quarter of the year, 18 games have earned a spot on this list, which compiles every game and expansion released in 2025 that received a review score of 8 or higher from IGN. These are IGN's best video games of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This list will be updated as new releases receive qualifying review scores.</em></p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Reviewed Games 2025</h3><p>Here's our running list of the best games we reviewed in 2025. Everything scored an 8 (Great) or higher is included. Sorted from newest to oldest.</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Review Score: 8 (“Great”)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>These games leave us with something outstanding to remember them by, usually novel gameplay ideas for single-player or multiplayer, clever characters and writing, noteworthy graphics and sound, or some combination thereof. If we have major complaints, there are more than enough excellent qualities to cancel them out.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> takes a flashing blade to the series’ established norms, trimming them to a more precise form in lieu of chopping them down outright. Combat is aggressive and requires more intentional parrying and skill management than in the past, and exploring the gorgeous provinces of Sengoku-period Japan is encouraged thanks to the revamped map that deemphasizes collecting icons and checking off lists. Naoe and Yasuke are well-realized and memorable protagonists, even though most of the story they drive follows pretty predictable paths. Both have unique playstyles that bolster each other’s weaknesses, but they are ultimately imbalanced by the fact that you can make use of the stealth and exploration skills of the master shinobi far more than the superhuman strength of the samurai. This isn’t the Assassin’s Creed that will change the minds of folks that never connected with the series before, but for those of us with lots of hours logged in the Animus, the sum of Shadows’ parts provide a refreshing realignment of the series that you should not skip. <em>– Jarrett Green</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Atomfall</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/atomfall-review">Atomfall</a> is a gripping survival-action adventure that takes some of the best elements of Fallout and Elden Ring, and synthesises them into its own fresh mutation. It presents a picturesque chunk of English countryside littered with alluring structures to pique and reward your curiosity, eccentric locals to meet, and absorbing mysteries to unravel, and uses classic iconography from British sci-fi and horror to consistently unsettling effect. In spite of some enemy behaviours that are occasionally less stable than a reactor in meltdown, Atomfall is a compelling, post-apocalyptic survival story that satisfyingly bends to your choices and discoveries no matter which direction you take. <em>– Tristan Ogilvie</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-review">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a> does not stray too far from what made the first one a cult hit, but it doesn’t need to. It tells a rich and poignant story about the complex nature of control on one’s self when that self is a machine that can be rebooted and hacked, finding and enriching community in the face of overwhelming odds, and expressing personhood both to oneself and to others. It’s visual novel-like presentation is heavy on reading and dice rolling, so its not exactly pulse-pounding, but the retooled character classes and stats, new crew missions, and stress mechanics provide just enough feedback and create a sense of precarity throughout that it stays engaging. <em>– Jarrett Green</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> Somehow, Donkey Kong Country Returns returned (again), but Nintendo’s third full release of this 2010 Wii platformer is almost as fresh and fun today as it was 15 years ago. DK’s satisfying, weighty movement paves the way for a challenging, momentum-based platformer that demands more skill and precision than the average Nintendo game. But it stays fun rather than frustrating thanks to incredibly impressive level design that explores every clever idea to the fullest and a ton of hidden collectibles worth tracking down. As a remaster specifically, it’s no more than a passable update, with graphics that can only really be described as “good enough” and some outdated elements that could have used more modern touches, like a lack of checkpoints during boss fights and a few obnoxious sections full of one-hit kill obstacles. But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> is still a competent update and easily the best way to play one of the greatest 2D platformers Nintendo has released this century. <em>– Logan Plant</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> Propelled by a breezy and often completely bananas treasure-hunting tale, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> is a delightful spin-off that seamlessly shifts between street thuggery and skulduggery. Majima’s Sea Dog stance is one of the most fun and flexible fighting styles I’ve enjoyed in the series to date – at least in its classic, combo-based form – and I welcomed the challenge of carefully balancing my crew lineup in order to survive the many turbulent naval battles. While its overworld maps feel a little padded out with recycled island settings, Honolulu itself is jammed with unpredictable substories and overhauled activities that meant every moment of shore leave was full of surprises. Absolutely heaving with buried treasures and varied pleasures, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a consistently captivating voyage that kept my timbers shivering whether on land or at sea. <em>– Tristan Ogilvie</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> continues to smooth off the traditionally rough edges of the series in smart ways, reducing as much friction as possible that could get in the way of you grabbing any of its exceptionally fun weapons and planting them firmly in a monster’s hide. But in that quest to make Monster Hunter more approachable, Wilds has carved a little too close to the bone in some places, trimming its challenge back so much that I barely needed to dig into its in-depth equipment system at all this time to become an apex predator. Its more flexible combat is some of the most fun I’ve had with the series, but like the blustering lighting storms of its gorgeous desert, it'll burns brightly but briefly until Capcom unleashes some real endgame beasts to challenge us. <em>– Tom Marks</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-2-black-review">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> is neither Ninja Gaiden 2 nor Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, but instead a secret third thing that mixes both versions together to create something that is wholly unique and by far the most beautiful version of this excellent action game yet. While I have a hard time calling it the definitive release because I prefer the original’s “more dudes who are more aggressive but die faster” approach, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is a definite improvement over the Sigma 2 release, fixes several long-standing issues, and unlike the original, isn’t trapped on the Xbox 360. It isn't the version I was hoping for (get on it, modders), but it is still an incredible game and I'm happy it exists. If this really is it for Ninja Gaiden 2, it will at least go out on a high note. This trip through time reminded me that while you can't go home again, and nothing will ever truly be like it was, that doesn't mean something can't still be beautiful. Ninja Gaiden 2 is remarkable, even with its flaws, and it's good to finally have it back in Black. <em>– Will Borger</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">PGA Tour 2K25</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> With substantial changes to how it looks and plays, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pga-tour-2k25-review">PGA Tour 2K25</a> feels like a different game from its predecessor. The new swing mechanics, paired with the significantly improved graphics, makes for a much more realistic ambiance, even with a lethargic performance by the announcing team. The highly customizable MyCareer campaign mode shines as one of the most enjoyable parts even though it has a tacked-on personality system, occasional unnecessary connectivity issues, and of course microtransactions. PGA Tour 2K25 is still a few strokes behind EA Sports PGA Tour as the best golfing simulator around, but if it continues to improve like this with each new iteration, we may see it close that gap relatively soon. <em>– Andrew McMahon</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rift of the NecroDancer</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> I could wear out my keyboard slapping arrow keys to the beat and jamming in my seat to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rift-of-the-necrodancer-review">Rift of the NecroDancer</a>’s excellent soundtrack, fervently chasing down a perfect run of a song for hours. Whether I was fighting stuffy puppet masters, rhythmically ridding the world of monsters, or just waddling around in a silly mole costume, it provides many excellent flavors of arcade-style rhythm action. Even though this “Greatest Hits” anthology isn’t as focused or Earth-shattering as Brace Yourself Games’ genre-bending debut album, it still continually surprised and delighted me by providing clever twists on time-tested mechanics. <em>– Charlie Wacholz</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tokyo Xtreme Racer (Early Access)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tokyo-xtreme-racer-early-access-review">Tokyo Xtreme Racer</a> is an infectiously addictive time capsule of a racing game that needs little more than a bit of menu refinement and some major aggression injected into its sound to really soup it up and prep it for even more classic Japanese cars to race in and against. In fact, it’s already well worth its early access asking price. It’s narrow in scope, but its highway battle hook makes it hard to put down, and its total lack of modern baggage like microtransactions and tacked-on multiplayer is outright refreshing. <em>– Luke Reilly</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">WWE 2K25</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> A couple of microtransaction-fueled missteps aside, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k25-review">WWE 2K25</a> is really the best wrestling game since… WWE 2K24, which was also pretty great. It looks fantastic, still feels good, and there’s a lot of it, including small but welcome updates like intergender matches or bigger updates like the new MyRise and Showcase modes. It’s an upscale wrestling buffet, if you will: It’s pretty scrumptious, there's a wide selection of dishes on the table, and you could spend an awful lot of time in the squared circle if you’re not careful. Speaking of, I need to get back to it. I have some more Showcase things to unlock, Universe is calling my name, and… well, you get the idea. <em>– Will Borger</em></p><h2 data-cy="title2">Review Score: 9 (“Amazing”)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We enthusiastically recommend that you add these games to your to-play list. If we call a game Amazing, that means something about it seriously impressed us, whether it’s an inspired new idea or an exceptional take on an old one. We expect to look back at it as one of the highlights of its time and genre.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> If <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dynasty-warriors-origins-review">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> is meant to be a new beginning, it’s one that gets off to a masterful start. It doesn’t just have the largest amount of enemies the series has thrown on screen at once, it also deepens its combat, improves its storytelling without getting in the way of the action, and provides a healthy amount of replayability and postgame content – all while looking better than ever. Your amnesiac hero is a bit too much of a blank slate at times, but the impressive ensemble cast made this story sing as I grew to care about the characters around him, big and small. Origins is both a great entry point for newcomers and a triumphant return for veterans like me who felt the last few entries had become stale or missed the mark. It feels like the series I once loved is finally back. <em>– Jada Griffin</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> In many ways, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> feels like it’s picked up and run with the reactive first-person RPG torch that Bethesda left lying in the mud years ago in pursuit of a broader audience. And it has excellent melee combat, which The Elder Scrolls never came close to even at its peak. Sometimes it's not sure if it wants to be a cinematic tale about a specific guy going on a specific adventure or a truly dynamic open-world sandbox packed with interesting and varied side quests, and that can lead to a few immersion-shattering conflicts. But most of the time, leaning into one doesn't get in the way of the other, and you’re free to go on any of its many optional adventures along the way to a thought-provoking and rousing finale for the main plot. I was delighted to get lost in its world, and it will be a long time before I forget its exceptional story. <em>– Leana Hafer</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">MLB The Show 25</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> MLB The Show remains one of the best sports series around. The new upgrade system  and the amateur portion of your player’s journey have reinvigorated Road To The Show, while the shift away from Sets and Seasons has righted Diamond Dynasty’s biggest wrong. While it’s a bit of a bummer that the Storylines feature isn’t living up to its full potential, it remains a worthwhile and important inclusion that has reach beyond the game of baseball. All the small touches, such as updated infielder reactions and new quick time events like the swim move, have the on-field action in a great place, too. It’s not always easy for an annual franchise to justify the move to a new entry, but in the case of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mlb-the-show-25-review">MLB The Show 25</a>, it does more than enough to make me glad it has arrived. <em>– Justin Koreis</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Split Fiction</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> An expertly crafted and absorbing co-op adventure that pinballs from one genre extreme to another, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">Split Fiction</a> is a rollercoaster of gameplay ideas and styles that are usually discarded as quickly as they’re introduced. This keeps it fabulously fresh for its full, 14-hour duration. With no idea sticking around long enough to get stale before making way for the next, it’s a victory of imagination and restraint in equal measure. Hazelight may have been rewriting the co-op rule book for a decade now, but Split Fiction is a new chapter that you (and a partner) cannot miss. <em>– Luke Reilly</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Two Point Museum</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/two-point-museum-review">Two Point Museum</a> is a rewarding, deep, challenging, and highly entertaining tycoon game that demonstrates Two Point Studios has really hit its groove with this third iteration of the idea. The variety of different exhibits to unlock and level up, the thrill of discovering new expedition maps, and the array of clever and easy-to-use management tools make designing and running a museum joyful and consistently rewarding. I've sunk more than 40 hours into it already and I could easily see doubling that without running out of stuff to do. Call the curator. They're really going to want to take a look at this. <em>– Leana Hafer</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Wanderstop</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> Every inch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wanderstop-review">Wanderstop</a> pushes the conventions you’d expect of similarly wholesome games. Its vibrant colors, quirky characters, and enchanting music are used to tell a compelling story that forces you to grapple with both its lead character's insecurities as well as your own. It’s a powerful adventure not just about burn out, but about how deeply painful it is to free ourselves from coping mechanisms that may have previously kept us secure. At the same time, Wanderstop’s simple but satisfying tea brewing experimentation serves as a safe and entertaining space to do that deep digging. There aren’t many games like Wanderstop out there currently, but for all our sakes, I hope there will be soon. <em>– Shailyn Cotten</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> Xenoblade Chronicles X was already one of the Wii U’s best games, and this Definitive Edition has escaped the destruction of its old home like the White Whale and settled down nicely on Switch. The quality-of-life improvements here are enough to justify another trip to Mira alone for veteran players, and it’s the perfect opportunity for newcomers to explore its beautiful landscapes for themselves. Its combat systems are deep and engaging, and the massive open world never got old to run, jump, or fly across. Its main story may not quite live up to the standards of the series, but a likable cast of characters and plenty of compelling side missions mean <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> is still an adventure worth writing back home about. <em>– George Yang</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jordan covers games, shows, and movies as a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
