            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">While Ubisoft keeps quiet about a potential <a href="https://in.ign.com/assassins-creed-black-flag" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> remake, the actor behind the game's hero Edward Kenway has offered up some teasing words to fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A souped-up version of Ubisoft's piratical Assassin's Creed entry has been the subject of numerous leaks over the past few years, and is now widely expected among fans. But Ubisoft itself has never confirmed the project ‚Äî and declined to comment on the matter when contacted by IGN last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-swirl-as-collectible-maker-admits-there-is-something-going-on">when an Assassin's Creed merchandise maker also dropped an obvious Black Flag remake hint</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, at a fan convention, Edward Kenway voice actor Matt Ryan has given perhaps the most obvious tease so far that something is on the horizon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Have you beaten the game?" Ryan asks a fan, as captured on video by TikTok user therebelarchive. "Well, you might have to beat it again..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the fan replies "Is this true? I have to run through all of them again," Ryan responds with a knowing wink, and then says: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Well, especially this one. There's a reason I say that, but I can't say anything."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Matt Ryan (Voice of Edward Kenway) Teases Black Flag Remaster via a fan interaction at a convention! </p><p>Quote <br>‚ÄúHave you beat the game?‚Ä¶ well you may have to beat it again üòâ‚Äù<br>And <br>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason I say that but I can‚Äôt say anything‚Ä¶‚Äù<a href="https://twitter.com/TheHiddenOneAC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@TheHiddenOneAC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealZephryss?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@TheRealZephryss</a> <a href="https://t.co/vg6RghgcE7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/vg6RghgcE7</a></p></div>‚Äî YT.com/Super DropKick (@SuperDropKick17) <a href="https://twitter.com/SuperDropKick17/status/1939385926305849352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">While Ryan is likely aware of the ongoing speculation around a Black Flag remaster, could his involvement in it extend beyond seeing his prior work re-released? Reports have suggested Ubisoft is working on a substantial re-working of Black Flag ‚Äî does that mean Ryan himself is involved, re-recordling dialogue, or contributing to new story elements?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Multiple reports charting the game's development have surfaced over the past couple of years, with the  <a href="https://in.ign.com/assassins-creed-black-flag/188218/news/ubisoft-is-reportedly-working-on-an-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Flag remake allegedly being worked on by Skull and Bones studio Ubisoft Singapore</a> (remember that Skull and Bones itself started life as a Black Flag spin-off), with work underway to offer something <a href="https://in.ign.com/assassins-creed-black-flag/222720/news/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-rumors-hint-at-new-in-game-systems-engine-it-will-be-built-on-an" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ultimately more substantial </a><a href="https://in.ign.com/assassins-creed-black-flag/222720/news/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-rumors-hint-at-new-in-game-systems-engine-it-will-be-built-on-an" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">than just a simple remaster</a>. Reports have suggested that this new version of Black Flag will boast all of the visual fidelity found in the recent Assassin's Creed Shadows, as well as expanded wildlife and combat systems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With no all-new Assassin's Creed game set for the end of this year, fans believe the Black Flag remake would be well positioned to arrive in time for the holidays. Here's hoping Ryan isn't made to walk the plank for dropping this latest hint, and it's not too long before Ubisoft makes the remake official.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has addressed Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition's rocky launch, extending its refund policy for the game, offering a 50% upgrade path discount, and promising a string of patches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-master-crafted-edition">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition</a> is a re-release of Relic Entertainment‚Äôs 2011 action game, Space Marine. Both Games Workshop and publisher Sega are not calling this a remaster. Instead they point to quality-of-life and graphical improvements "that take the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine experience to the next level."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These include higher fidelity and improved textures, 4k resolution, "improved" character models, a modernized control scheme and interface overhaul, and remastered audio.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition launched on June 10 across Xbox Series X and S and PC, and straight into Game Pass (there‚Äôs no word on a PS5 version). While it appears to be going down okay on Game Pass, on Steam, where Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition costs $39.99 / ¬£34.99, it has a ‚Äòmostly negative‚Äô user review rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-master-crafted-edition-has-a-mostly-negative-steam-user-review-rating-with-players-labeling-it-a-shameless-blatant-cash-grab">Most of the complaints revolve around the high price of the game relative to the changes it makes over the Anniversary Edition</a>, with other issues including usability problems and somewhat baffling visual changes. A lot of the negative reviews are from fans who say Sega should have given this Master Crafted Edition to owners of the original game for free or with a discount, which leads us nicely onto Sega‚Äôs latest update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3169520/view/523095184762732964" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on Steam</a>, Sega said ‚Äúwe‚Äôve heard your concerns around pricing,‚Äù and outlined the steps it was taking. To start, it has extended its refund window for Master Crafted Edition to July 10. This means that if you bought the game you can get a full refund, regardless of playtime, as long as you request it before 6pm BST / 10pm PST on July 10, 2025 (when the Steam Summer Sale ends). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, there is, as so many fans had asked for, now a 50% upgrade discount. If you own Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Anniversary Edition, you‚Äôre eligible for a 50% discount when buying the Master Crafted Edition until 6pm BST / 10pm PST July 10 2025 when the discount offer ends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, that means if you already bought the Master Crafted Edition and qualify for the discount, you‚Äôll need to request a refund manually via Steam Support (before July 10) then re-buy the game at the discounted price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe know this situation has been frustrating for some of you, and we‚Äôre sorry for the confusion it‚Äôs caused,‚Äù Sega added. ‚ÄúWe hope this approach offers a workable solution while we continue improving the game itself.‚Äù</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of which, Sega released the patch roadmap for Master Crafted Edition. It includes a number of improvements all due out in the coming weeks. Highlights include user interface enhancements, fixes for the game running on Steam Deck, and networking improvements. The details are below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe‚Äôll continue listening, improving, and communicating as these changes go live,‚Äù Sega concluded. ‚ÄúThanks for sticking with us.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000 video games have been on a great run lately, with the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii"><u>Space Marine 2</u></a> leading the charge of well-received, successful titles.
