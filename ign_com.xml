With the big update coming on February 10, players will get five new heroes (with five more coming over the rest of the season), a number of quality of life updates, new in-game events, and later this spring, an upgrade option for Nintendo Switch 2 players specifically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced during today's Overwatch Spotlight 2026, it was revealed that a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Overwatch 2 is finally on its way later this spring. We didn't get any real details as to what the release was going to entail as of yet. Overwatch 2 is already on the Nintendo Switch and thus playable on Switch 2, but it's just the regular edition, and a Switch 2 would presumably have some upgrades attached. We'll have to wait until Season 2 sometime this spring to find out.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Overwatch "The Reign of Talon" New Hero Images</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This will be welcome news for Switch players, as there have long been complaints that Overwatch 2 on the Nintendo Switch offers no meaningful technical improvements over the original Overwatch. A Switch 2 edition could also potentially introduce mouse controls, which might be desirable for those wanting something closer to a PC experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch 2 will now be known as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-ditching-the-2-amid-launch-of-new-story-driven-era-with-ten-new-heroes">just Overwatch going forward</a>, as was also announced during today's Overwatch Spotlight, as the game undergoes a major overhaul headed into a year-long narrative of events, hero trailers, stories, comics, map updates, and more telling the story of a Talon takeover. Ten new heroes are planned for release over the next year, with a new story arc planned to start in 2027 when this one has concluded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It's all just Overwatch now as the game enters a "new, story-driven era" with a year-long narrative, 10 new heroes, and a major overhaul.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced today at the Overwatch Spotlight, Blizzard revealed its first year-long storyline, entitled "The Reign of Talon". As it sounds, the plot is going to focus on the antagonistic faction Talon as it takes over around the world, while Overwatch continues to fight back. In-game events, hero trailers, animated comics, short stories, and map updates will tell a story across six seasons rolled out throughout the entire year, beginning with the launch of five new heroes on February 10 as Season 1 begins. On the Talon side, new heroes will include Domina (tank), Emre (damage), and Mizuki (support), and on Overwatch we'll get Anran (damage) and Jetpack Cat (support). More heroes will join in the future, with a new hero added in each of Season 2-6 to come. A new story arc is planned to begin with another Season 1 in 2027.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Overwatch "The Reign of Talon" New Hero Images</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other updates include a new Meta Event called Conquest, where players choose to align with either Overwatch or Talon over five weeks to compete for rewards including lootboxes, skins, and titles. We'll also be seeing a major UI and UX overhaul with a new hero lobby and a promise of faster navigation. And we're also getting a Hello Kitty-themed in-game event from February 10-23.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/03/spotlight-2026-roadmap-1770137812637.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid all of this, Blizzard is officially dropping the "2" from Overwatch 2, and referring to it going forward just as Overwatch. As a press release explains: "Overwatch is more than just a digit: it's a living universe that keeps growing, keeps surprising, and keeps bringing players together from around the world. This year marks a huge turning point in how the development team envisions the future of Overwatch, so we are officially dropping '2' and moving forward as 'Overwatch'."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The newly-dubbed "Overwatch" will also be getting an upgraded Nintendo Switch 2 edition in the spring (both the original Overwatch and Overwatch 2 are currently available on Nintendo Switch, and thus Switch 2, but do not have dedicated Switch 2 upgraded versions).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no surprise that Blizzard might want to wipe the slate clean from the struggle that has been Overwatch 2. The sequel/revamp of 2016's popular hero shooter Overwatch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-blizzard-apologizes-for-shaky-launch-promises-fixes-for-queues-and-more">stumbled out of the gate</a>, and while it saw a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-has-reached-over-25-million-players-in-its-first-10-days-35-million-in-its-first-month">massive surge of players at the start</a>, those numbers <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-engagement-and-player-investment-is-declining-activision-blizzard-admits">dropped in the following year</a>. As time went on, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-becoming-the-worst-user-reviewed-game-ever-on-steam-overwatch-2s-recent-reviews-jump-to-mixed">user reviews complained</a> about a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-becomes-worst-user-reviewed-game-on-steam-ever-even-as-tens-of-thousands-turn-up-to-play">number of issues</a> such as monetization and controversies around the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-pve-hero-mode-canceled-a-difficult-choice">cancellation of the game's long-awaited PvE Hero mode</a>. The game has seen modes, features, and plans come and go over the years, and this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reveals-radical-overhaul-of-overwatch-2-including-return-of-loot-boxes-perks-and-third-person-mode">isn't even the first major overhaul</a> Blizzard has announced. The fact remains that Overwatch 2 has never quite lived up to the hype levels of its predecessor, Overwatch, and this could be an attempt on Blizzard's part to regain some of that glory - especially by focusing so much on story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
