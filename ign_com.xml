At first, I feared I had been ensnared by sorcery, but now I have access to something far more wondrous: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-black-friday-2024-deals">Black Friday shopping</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What is this curious holiday where people queue in droves to trade their coin for treasures I could scarcely dream of? As I learned of these deals and contraptions, I vowed to document my findings. For if you, too, were a time traveler, these are the marvels you'd surely wish to bring home—these marvels (the best Black Friday deals to shop on Thanksgiving, by the way) would astonish any soul, no matter the century.</p><p id="gaming-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Gaming Deals">Gaming Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I would keep up the whole 17th century pilgrim theme but I'm short on time and lacking in creativity after writing about Black Friday deals for a month! Anyway, here are the absolute doorbusting deals you should come to expect from a Black Friday sale, including some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-video-games-black-friday-deals">major discounts on top games</a> like Star Wars Outlaws, Sonic X Shadow Generations, Persona 3 Reload, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not satisfied? Fine, have a look through the best console deals for Thanksgiving as well. With discounts on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-playstation-console-deals-black-friday-2024">PS5 console bundles</a> (now down to just $375 for the digital edition), along some of the best ever discounts we've seen for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-best-black-friday-deals-2024">Nintendo Switch</a>. These bargains won't last forever, and some are even going out of stock as I write this (blast!). </p><p id="home-and-hearth-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Home and Hearth Deals">Home and Hearth Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Have you ever considered the modern miracle that is the Air Fryer? It's a wonder of science and feels very much like magic in a small to medium container. It can cook sausages, chicken, falafel, and pretty much anything you can think of. Expect oatmeal, don't try making oatmeal in your air fryer. </p><p id="apple-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple Deals">Apple Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever contraption you're eyeing, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-apple-deals-black-friday-2024">Black Friday Apple deals</a> are a good place to start. AirPod Pro (2nd Gen with USB-C) are <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7b3jy?object_uuid=a7ce8b62-e625-4ec6-93f1-5ef08543298b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D1XD1ZV3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on sale at Amazon</a> for $153.99 right now. I'd say it's safe to grab them if you're in the market, as that's the best price we've ever seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for standard AirPods, both Amazon and Target are offering a $10 off the new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-airpods-4-with-anc-review">4th gen AirPods with active noise cancellation</a> and the model without. I personally prefer the Pro model because the silicon ear tips work well for me, but some people don't like them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has just dropped prices across the board on various <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-ipads-early-black-friday-deals-2024">Apple iPad models for Black Friday</a>, including the the <a href="https://zdcs.link/NMoYd?object_uuid=a7ce8b62-e625-4ec6-93f1-5ef08543298b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">10th gen Apple iPad</a>, which is now down to $249.99 after you clip a $29.01 off coupon on the product page. This is the best price we've seen ever since it was launched back in 2022, and I am pretty certain it won't drop again for Black Friday.</p><p id="tech-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tech Deals">Tech Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay there's a few more excellent gaming deals rolled into one here, but you can't deny how excellent some of these offers are? Steam Deck on sale, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-meta-quest-3s-deal-2024-bonus-best-buy-target-gift-card">Meta Quest 3S with probably the best deal we've ever had on the VR headset</a>. I mean $75 <em>free </em>Amazon credit sounds a little too good to be true, but it's not! The deal is real and well worth picking up ASAP. Still hungry? Well go have some more turkey. I kid, or do I?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't. Check out even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-devices-echo-kindle-black-friday-2024">more great tech offers on Amazon devices</a>, perfect for improving your smart home experience in the short and long term. My favorite offer here? It's the Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $33, a new low of the streaming stick, which is also now Xbox Game Pass enabled. Get rolling, as these deals really are the cream of the crop this Thanksgiving. </p><p id="streaming-black-friday-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Streaming Black Friday Deals">Streaming Black Friday Deals</h2></p><div catalogid="08f6102b-d1c3-4715-b3e4-b7fe53fe7888" id="191844"><div id="191844" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hulu (Ad Plan)</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Get 12 months at $0.99 per month, offer ends December 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-x-terraria-coming-in-2025-december-update-set-to-add-huge-new-island<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair has teased a major update for the game coming in December as well as a crossover with Terraria.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking to the Palworld Discord, Pocketpair said the December update adds the “largest, harshest, and most mysterious” island yet to Palworld. This new island is about six times bigger than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Sakurajima:_New_Pals_and_How_to_Access">Sakurajima</a>, which hit Palworld in June.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Don't miss it!” Pocketpair teased alongisde the screenshots, below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld December 2024 Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Pocketpair teased a surprise crossover with indie smash hit Terraria. There are no details yet, but artwork, below, shows characters from both games clasping hands. Expect whatever this is to arrive in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this comes, of course, as Pocketpair works to defend itself in a high-profile patent lawsuit filed by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. After Palworld’s huge launch earlier this year on PC and Xbox, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have gone down the patent route. They want 5 million yen (approx $32,846) each plus late payment damages, as well as an injunction against Palworld that would block its release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-reveals-patents-at-the-heart-of-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-lawsuit-and-how-much-money-its-being-sued-for"><u>Pocketpair confirmed the three Japan-based patents</u></a>, which revolve around catching Pokémon in a virtual field, that it's being sued over. Palworld <em>does</em> include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, similar to the mechanic seen in the 2022 Nintendo Switch exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus"><u>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</u></a>. One of the three patents in question is about riding on top of Pokémon (Palworld also lets players ride Pals).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One patent expert has suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-may-end-up-getting-help-from-an-unlikely-source-in-its-nintendo-patent-lawsuit-an-8-year-old-gta-5-pokmon-mod">a GTA 5 mod dating back to 2016 may be recognized as a precedent by the court</a> because it included the catching Pokémon mechanic long before Pokémon Legends: Arceus. If that happens, it could work in Palworld’s favor.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/28/gduzmzzaoamf-7t-1732804325873.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Palworld gets a Terraria crossover at some point in 2025. Image credit Pocketpair.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC earlier this year, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, signing a deal with Sony to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patent experts have said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-lawsuit-shows-just-how-seriously-nintendo-views-the-threat-of-palworld-patent-expert-says"><u>Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s lawsuit against Pocketpair is evidence of the threat posed by Palworld</u></a>, which has since gone on to launch on PS5. Pocketpair has vowed to take on Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in court, saying: “We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Known for its fast-paced action and revolutionary 3D graphics (even though they weren't true 3D!), DOOM popularized multiplayer deathmatches. Did you see the game's chainsaw weapon was inspired by a real chainsaw the developers kept in their office?</li></ul></li><li><strong>DOOM II (1994)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>The sequel expanded on its predecessor with new enemies (like the deadly Arch-Vile), weapons (double-barreled shotgun, anyone?), and larger levels. It also introduced modding tools that made DOOM II one of the most modified games of all time.</li></ul></li><li><strong>DOOM 64 (1997)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>A Nintendo 64 exclusive for years, this cult hit features darker graphics and a haunting soundtrack compared to earlier entries. Fun fact: DOOM 64 introduced the "Unmaker," a demonic laser weapon not seen in any other game until DOOM Eternal.</li></ul></li><li><strong>DOOM 3 (2004)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>This reboot brought horror to the forefront with its dark corridors, jump scares, and a flashlight you couldn't use simultaneously with weapons (a controversial design choice). DOOM 3 also marked id Software's first foray into true 3D rendering.</li></ul></li><li><strong>DOOM (2016)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>This fan-favorite reboot resurrected the franchise with fast, brutal gameplay that ditched cover mechanics for relentless forward momentum. The "Glory Kill" mechanic was a game-changer, encouraging players to get up close and personal with enemies.</li></ul></li><li><strong>DOOM Eternal Deluxe Edition (2020)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>The most recent entry cranked up the chaos with more vertical movement, new weapons, and a deeper storyline.
