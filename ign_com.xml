Up until now, even if you physically had a Switch 2 in your hands, the device was firmly locked offline.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Nintendo has also used today's Mario Kart World update to make several tweaks to the game itself. Intriguingly, the patch unlocks a wider pool of characters for you to play from the off. Presumably, Nintendo had originally intended for more racers to require unlocking.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've increased the number of characters that can be selected from the start," a line of Nintendo's patch notes confirms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another tweak is that there had been a time limit for deciding on a course when playing in local multiplayer, as there presumably still will be when playing online. This has also been removed, as of today's patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing this Mario Kart World patch doesn't add is 200cc mode.
