They only learn to wait." — as well as a button you can press to hear an excerpt from some poetry.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/28/screenshot-2026-01-28-172022-1769621320373.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Bloober Team's creepy teaser website.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Thou art sick... invisible flies in the night..." an intense-sounding voice reads out when the website's Play button is pressed. "Howling storm has found out thy bed of crimson joy... Dark secret thy life destroy." These sections are snippets of a William Blake poem named "The Sick Rose" — which could be a hint to what this is all about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the Valentine's Day date and an image of a rose (which, when clicked, begins to bleed), clearly roses are a big theme here. It's enough that some fans have speculated that the tease is for a new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/rule-of-rose-141873">Rule of Rose</a> game, or remake of the original.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released back in 2006 for PlayStation 2, the PlayStation-published survival horror title would seem to be within Bloober Team's wheelhouse. And, of course, Silent Hill fans needn't worry — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-1-remake-officially-in-development-at-bloober-team-konami-has-announced">the developer is also working on a remake of the franchise's original game too</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

"Missions shift fluidly between stealth infiltration, close-quarters firefights, sniping, urban espionage, code-breaking operations, vehicular combat, and sudden large-scale assaults," 4Defiant said. Check out the first trailer above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Defiant - First Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Defiant's developers said they're aiming to convey a reverence for history, noting that "weapons in The Defiant are treated as historical artefacts, not just tools" and that the campaign "aims to reframe how the FPS genre approaches history, offering a perspective rarely seen in interactive entertainment." The team added, "The game unfolds across occupied villages, frozen forests, fortified supply routes, and enemy-controlled urban zones, where every environment is shaped by the realities of guerrilla warfare and survival behind enemy lines."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3184960/The_Defiant/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wishlist</a> The Defiant on Steam if you're interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.
