            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN Store has partnered with Bethesda Softworks and world-renowned artist Dave Rapoza to create Hellwalkers - the latest piece in IGN’s exclusive museum-quality IGN Artist Series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Available only on IGN Store, <em><strong>Hellwalkers - IGN Artist Series 004</strong></em> vividly captures the menace and power of the legendary Doomslayer, as made possible by the equally legendary artist Dave Repoza, a lifelong Doom fan himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN Store has <strong>400 premium weight art prints ($70)</strong> and <strong>100 premium acrylic art prints ($275)</strong> - both measuring a bold 18 x 24 inches. These pieces are brutal, iconic, and highly-collectible.</p><a href="https://store.ign.com/collections/ign-artist-series-doom" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Each print is individually numbered and signed by Dave Rapoza and the acrylic print is truly fine art, backed on gator board and featuring a Certificate of Authenticity (laser-etched on the Doomslayer’s Shield Saw). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Id software has proven for more than 30 years that Doom truly is eternal. Since its world-shaping debut in 1993 to the epic, weighty, powerful play style of The Dark Ages, the Doom franchise’s Doomslayer has stood at the forefront of gaming as an immortal icon. This IGN Artist Series is a must-own for any serious Doom fan, and will not be reprinted once it is gone. The piece is destined to become a collector’s item, and is a perfect edition to any Doom fan’s wall. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dave Rapoza is a self-taught artist who grew up in Carver, MA.  For nearly 20 years his stunning artwork has been turning heads. Rapoza’s artwork has graced Marvel Comics covers, Magic: the Gathering, Paizo Publishing projects and a huge range of others. He has also contributed art to Diablo IV, League of Legends and the Witcher 3, among many other games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"My first experience with Doom was playing the original in my neighbor’s kitchen on their ancient computer—it made a big impression on me, especially the music and definitely helped spark my love for games,” Repoza said. “Whenever I take on something like this, I try to tap into what made me a fan in the first place and boil that down into a single image. It’s a fun challenge, and I’m proud of how this one turned out. Hope you enjoy it!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The IGN Artist Series is IGN’s love letter to the pop culture icons we all love to watch, play, and discuss. Available for under a day, IGN Artist Series 001, 002, and 003 was produced in partnership with Bethesda and Amazon Prime Video and featured Fallout’s The Ghoul, Maximus, and Lucy MacLean, from artist Kevin Tong. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/limited-edition-ign-artist-series-hellwalker-prints-from-dave-rapoza-now-available]]></content:encoded>

You can defeat all sorts of enemies and then resurrect them to fight for you. Over time, you'll amass a large squad of teammates to help you complete quests. Using free summons from the codes in this article, you can also get characters heavily inspired by other popular anime shows too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jeffrey Lerman is a freelance game journalist for IGN who has been covering games for over a decade.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> fans believe they've now worked out the truth behind recent teases that suggested something was going on with Rockstar's beloved cowboy franchise — but it's not what many fans had been hoping for. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, John Marston actor Rob Wiethoff teased that he had "exciting news" to share that was "absolutely killing" him to keep quiet, while chatting with fans during a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lbextu/i_wonder_what_this_could_mean" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">livestream</a>. Wiethoff suggested that, whatever the news was, fans would hear about it by the end of this week — and that he wouldn't be the only one sharing it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mystery deepened when Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan actor Roger Clark subsequently confirmed that he was also aware of the news, but couldn't yet say more. Immediately, fans began to speculate that the pair were involved in some kind of announcement regarding the future of the franchise, such as the reveal of an upgraded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> — something that has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-reportedly-set-for-nintendo-switch-2-by-end-of-2025-and-theres-a-rumored-next-gen-upgrade-patch-too">previously been reported as in development for Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With fan hopes at fever pitch, Wiethoff released a statement earlier this week clearly designed to manage expectations. In it, John Marston's voice actor said he "possibly misled some people" in regards to how exciting the announcement was, and said he did "not make announcements for Rockstar games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I do have something I'm really excited about, I truly am, and I think you will be too," Wiethoff said. "I really do think so, but I possibly misled some people when I announced that I have something to announce that I can't talk about right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Just please recognize – and I know that you know this, but let me remind you, I guess – I do not make announcements for Rockstar Games. We all know that, I'm just reminding you I do not make announcements for Rockstar Games. Rockstar Games makes announcements for Rockstar Games, and they don't use me to do that."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/cyberboiuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@cyberboiuk</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Mctannen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Mctannen</a> <br>Rob Wiethoff has clarified that his announcement has nothing to do with rockstar. <a href="https://t.co/WmlWJD1GSQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/WmlWJD1GSQ</a></p>— jon🚬 (@jonbranham_) <a href="https://twitter.com/jonbranham_/status/1935043619754250697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">So what is the big mystery announcement? Well, fans have now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lg4jz3/was_this_the_announcement_rob_was_so_excited_for/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted</a> confirmation of a Red Dead Redemption and Red Dead Redemption 2 cast reunion, which is set to take place at the National Gaming Expo in Tampa, Florida from August 8 to August 10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Was this the announcement [Wiethoff] was so excited for?" wrote one fan on reddit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think so," added replied.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It would be great if they waited for this convention to reveal there's going to be SOME kind of update, remastering, DLC, a next chapter etc," said a third. "It's definitely wishful thinking on my part."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Dead Redemption 2 originally launched for PS4 and Xbox One back in October 2018, and arrived on PC a year later. Fans have long hoped for a revamped version designed to take advantage of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, but, more than five years after those consoles launched, a re-release or remaster is yet to arrive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Rockstar has been busy during this time building Grand Theft Auto 6, which after its recent delay will now launch on May 26, 2026. Surely there's time to pop out a Red Dead Redemption 2 patch before then?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
