Matt Cox, General Manager of Call of Duty, insisted that “as a team, our vision from the start was to create a back-to-back series experience for our players that embraced the uniqueness of the Black Ops sub-franchise.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 7 is set to star Milo Ventimiglia, Kiernan Shipka, and Michael Rooker, with Ventimiglia portraying David Mason, Shipka as new character Emma Kagen, and Rooker reprising his Black Ops 2 role of Mike Harper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-insists-heavily-criticized-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-ads-in-loadout-menus-were-a-test-published-in-error-strips-them-out-following-backlash"><u>Activision pulled controversial adverts placed inside Black Ops 6 and Warzone loadouts</u></a>, insisting they were a “feature test” published “in error.” It’s worth remembering that Black Ops 6 is a premium, $70 game, and this year’s Black Ops 7 is expected to jump to $80 after Microsoft said that gamers will see Xbox charging $79.99 for new, first-party games around the holiday season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And don't forget, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beavis-and-butt-head-are-coming-to-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-with-season-04-reloaded-and-players-are-joking-theyre-more-milsim-than-most-skins-in-the-game"><u>Beavis and Butt-Head are now in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
