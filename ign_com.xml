            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Incredibly, almost <em>unfathomably</em>, the humble original PlayStation, our little grey slab of joy, is turning 30. It's got grey hairs, now old enough to have a couple of kids, a few different careers, a car in the garage. You could say it's accomplished all those things in different ways.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/special/playstation-30th-birthday-giveaway-au?">Aussies: Win a PlayStation®5 Pro Console – 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Bundle!</a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In the before-times, many previous and current IGN AU staff cut their teeth at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation:_The_Official_Magazine" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Official PlayStation 2 Magazine</a> (Narayan Pattison, Tristan Ogilvie, Luke Reilly, Patch Kolan, and Adam Mathew among them), so it's an understatement to say that the brand, hardware, games and experiences were formative for us and extremely close to our hearts.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Little Grey Box That Could</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">When the original PlayStation launched in Australia, stock was extremely limited and the thing cost $AUD699 (or about $1300 in today's money) if you could manage to get your hands on it. If you did, you could play nearly a nearly perfect port of Namco's superb Ridge Racer, try some 3D fighting (a novelty!) in Battle Arena Toshinden, a bit of 3D platforming (woah!) in Jumping Flash!, and 2D sidescrolling platforming in Rayman. The games were perhaps a tad "safe" at the time, but it hinted at big things coming – and within a year, the PlayStation had cemented itself in the Australian gaming landscape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up my PS1 from a Cash Converters in 1999, then immediately bought <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/10/22/metal-gear-solid-6">Metal Gear Solid</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/09/04/final-fantasy-vii-review">Final Fantasy VII</a>. From there, I delived into a catalogue of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/10/21/xenogears">JRPGs</a>, racing simulators (yeah, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/08/23/gran-turismo-3">that series</a>), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/09/01/r-type-delta">scrolling shooters</a> and impenetrable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokimeki_Memorial_(video_game)" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dating games</a> as my N64 quietly looked on, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/06/03/superman-2">judging me</a> from the shelf. I'm fairly certain I did not see daylight for about two years – and I knew I wanted to do this stuff as a career. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By that point, it was also clear that Sony had a stranglehold over the entire industry – delivering a suite of the finest games month after month that neither Nintendo or SEGA could match for sheer volume. It brought gaming out of the niche basements of the stereotypical gamer and put it smack-bang on the covers of cool magazines. It changed everything.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/536276266-1321476293317591-6086579087571452701-n-1762817912289.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Shots fired. Nintendo and Squaresoft had a, ah, <em>strained</em> dynamic back in the '90s. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">By 2000, the world was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/03/ps2-playstation-2-lands-with-a-splash">getting swept up into the hype machine</a> around the forthcoming PlayStation 2 – a monolithic black slab emblazoned with a twist of striking blue <em>P-S-2</em> lettering. It looked sleek. It looked powerful. In a Kubrickian way, it whispered, <em>"I am a mysterious and untouchable creation that will change the world"</em>. In a very real sense, it did. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The PlayStation 2 Arrives</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With launch games like Ridge Racer V and Tekken Tag Tournament, it brought the PlayStation brand out of infancy and into the big leagues. Sony's much-vaunted "Emotion Engine" promised state-of-the-art graphical fidelity, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/03/ps2-demos-to-die-for">showcased in real-time tech demos</a> that exceeded prerendered cutscenes on the PS1. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a breakthrough. Everyone wanted it – a DVD player! A gaming console! In one! And at the time, it was shockingly affordable for a device that could offer both. It propelled DVD sales, gave additional breathing room for developers moving towards larger games (and files). The controller even had analogue face buttons! Can you dig it, baby? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/04/ps2-launch-thousands-clamor-in-the-streets-for-playstation-2">The Japanese launch was an overwhelming success</a>, propelling international hype for the PS2 into the stratosphere.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/screenshot-2025-11-11-at-10-45-38-am-1762818359583.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Iconic and minimalist, the PlayStation 2's blue box proudly displayed on launch day in Akihabara.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN AU started up in 2006 – exactly 10 years after the debut of the PS1 (or PSX as everyone had taken to calling it). In those days, the PS3 had only just debuted in Japan to rapturouos response, thanks to the disruptive adoption of Blu-ray players (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/08/blu-ray-vs-hd-dvd">going head-to-head against HD DVD, then cutting off HD DVD's head to become the dominant format of the 2010s)</a> and increasing uptake of 1080p displays. People wanted content to showcase their cool tech. Sony delivered the PS3: an all-in-one Blu-ray player, harddrive-equipped media device and, at the time, beastly gaming device.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PS3: Running Up That Hill</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony, it must be said, made it a bit hard for itself around this time. The birth of the meme-era took on the PS3 press reveal, turning "Riiiiiiiidge Racer!", "Giant enemy crab" and "George Foreman grill" into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT920jOJUsY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet phenomenons</a>. That seemed to start a period of iffy consumer sentiment, in part aimed at the USD$499 and USD$599 launch pricing. The Australian launch was still off in the distance, over the horizon, but gamers were braced for a sting in the wallet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We got our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/15/au-ps3-first-impressions">first hands-on look at the PS3</a> as a fledgling Australian team of three fine folks: Bennett Ring, Cam Shea, and myself. Sony Australia rolled out a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/20/pause-australian-playstation-event">series of consumer and media events</a> in which to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/27/au-sony-experience-more-event-coverage">showcase its polished ovoid tower</a> and we walked away mostly impressed by the potential of the system. IGN's US team were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/12/22/ps3-2006-year-in-review">on hand to cover the year's launch titles</a> too. Resistance: Fall of Man was the media darling of the time and, to this day, remembered very fondly. However, it had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/09/world-war-iii-ign-aus-next-gen-console-showdown">some teething pains and needed to grow into itself</a>.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/11/screenshot-2025-11-11-at-4-40-52-pm-1762839656871.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ex-IGN Big Boss Bennett Ring swerves into the Motorstorm turns, while Cam stands there, looking tall.</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a few years, and a few price cuts and redesigns, the PS3 finally found momentum and delivered on its ambitions. We have the PS3 to thank for Naughty Dog's Uncharted series – a game that, for many, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/13/uncharted-drakes-fortune-review">came out of the mists and made the console a must-buy</a>. By Uncharted 2, it was clear that Nathan Drake was a star for the ages, and Naughty Dog was just getting started.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without doubt, the system's<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/05/the-last-of-us-review"> pinnacle achievement was The Last of Us</a>. It was a technical showcase for the ageing hardware and a cinematic and gameplay line in the sand for developers. At risk of turning this into a love letter to Naughty Dog, Sony truly understood that this studio propelled its hardware forward – and gamers responded to it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around this time, Sony also went on a Wii-inspired foray into motion-based gaming with the PlayStation Move controller and camera. It was successful enough to spawn a whole series of Move-enabled titles. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">PlayStation <em>Phwoar</em>!</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A whopping 12 whole years ago, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/20/playstation-4-revealed">the PlayStation 4 was revealed in fine fashion</a>. Cam and Luke waxed lyrical about it in the video above. It seemed then, as it does now, a return to form for Sony's PlayStation brand. It came out of the gates strong and player focussed. The "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZkMdi3XBhw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For the Players</a>" campaign underscored a renewed focus on the core player experience. Wisely so, particularly with Nintendo's Switch just around the corner and an industry that was never bigger and more flush with great games and hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there were new experiences to be had – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/14/a-closer-look-at-the-playstation-4-controller-prototype">and a new controller design</a> (the first major rethink of the iconic PlayStation controller in the system's history) was coming. Naughty Dog released another breakthrough title, The Last of Us 2. The power of the PS4 also enabled Sony to experiment with another emerging field: VR.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, the PSVR headset. For the time and not <em>un</em>substantial money, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review">PSVR offered impressive VR fidelity combined with great games</a> and IPs that other competing hardware could only look on enviously. When juiced up with the PS4 Pro (a new mid-generation hardware refresh), it improved performance even further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While VR may have had its moment in the sun, and it now feels like the technology is mostly hibernating until the next big thing comes along, it pointed towards more TV-free gaming experiences that have become more and more normalised.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PS5 and Beyond</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/playstation-5/PlayStation_5_Release_Date,_Pricing,_and_Launch_Games">Enter: The PS5</a>. PlayStation 5 – the current generation of Sony consoles, in standard and Pro models. By 2020, digital marketplaces were standard and the TV screen was just one way of interacting with your PlayStation. The PS5 ushered in PSVR 2, a souped up version of the PSVR we know and love. Plus, it brought to the table a Switch-like (but not quite) handheld solution: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-portal-review">The PlayStation Portal</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've noticed, we haven't discussed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-psp-games">Sony's PSP</a> (in gloriously piano black, a luxurious widescreen handheld in 2004) or the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/02/13/sony-playstation-vita-review">PS Vita</a> – pseudo PS3 in your pocket. But all of those handheld experiences seem to have been teasing where Sony (and Nintendo, for that matter) are heading. Already rumours are swirling about the <em>PlayStation 6</em> and oh boy do I feel old now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So here's to you, Sony PlayStation. You are 30 years young in Australia. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a very different world and games industry today than the one that I and many others remember from the turn of the millenium. However, the PlayStation has been an island of stability, joy, and adventure throughout. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will we all be playing our PS10s in 2055? Jacked straight into our neural cortex like a back alley goon from Neuromancer? Will TVs still exist? What about game stores? One thing is true: PlayStation fans will always adore this brand – so in a sense, the future is up to you.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/special/playstation-30th-birthday-giveaway-au?">Aussies: Win a PlayStation®5 Pro Console – 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Bundle!</a></h3></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-au-retrospective-playstation-turns-30-in-australia]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Anno 117: Pax Romana Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/anno-117-pax-romana-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anno-117-pax-romana-review.1349419/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As the sun rises on the cobbled market street that ascends from bustling docks on the vibrant Mediterranean waters to the new forum high on the hill above, Anno 117: Pax Romana fills me with delight and civic pride. It took a long time, but I feel like I finally clicked with this series that I've had a little bit of a rocky relationship with, having come in a bit late and at an awkward time with 2205. Its complex economics can still seem to wobble spectacularly off their axis and leave you in a dire failure spiral, but resplendent mechanics for trade, naval warfare, and the blending of cultures offer chances to right the ship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The basic routine in Anno 117 is familiar and effective if you've played other games in the series. You start out building modest residences to house hardworking <em>liberti, </em>or freed people<em> </em>– somewhat conspicuously sidestepping the institution of Roman slavery. When their needs are met, they can promote up the social ladder all the way to snobby patricians who demand all kinds of exotic delicacies from around the world.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of what influences these promotions is simply access to goods, which is a city-wide thing. But another component is living near high prestige buildings like theaters and shrines… and far away from unpleasant or polluting ones like a charcoal burner. I love the way this naturally creates clusters of higher-class housing on important market streets, tapering off into working class neighborhoods in more industrial areas. It adds to the feel of a real, living city. And since paved roads extend the range of those buildings, that's an upgrade that lets you immediately see its positive effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's genuinely delightful to zoom in and watch my little toga-clad citizens going about their business. Every building from a stately villa to an idyllic lavender farm is studded with detail and character. Even the untouched green fields and peaceful blue waters full of marine life create a strong sense of place. The character models for leaders and advisors may be the one thing that didn't wow me. They're full of character, but especially in some of the campaign cutscenes, there were some significant lip sync issues that made it look like a much older game or a badly-dubbed movie.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Anno 117 really comes alive with its detailed trade system.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The summery paradise of Latium isn't the only locale to explore and exploit. Eventually you unlock the ability to sail to foggy, rocky Albion – that is, Britain – with its own resources, aesthetic, and population. I was a bit worried Anno would lean too hard into othering stereotypes about "mystical Celts" here based on some of the marketing, but it's actually a pretty grounded and sensible depiction. The really interesting choice you have mechanically in this region is whether to stay true to Celtic traditions or fully Romanize your new subjects. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, and you can eventually mix and match for some powerful synergies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anno 117 really comes alive with its detailed trade system, though. To truly meet the needs of demanding nobles in the two regions, you'll have to set up production chains for luxury goods that might pull resources from two or three different islands, then ship them across the world map from one region to another. Each delivery requires individual ships assigned to the trade routes, so I can see exactly where my next delivery of cheese is and even reroute it somewhere else.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is all fairly easy to set up and tweak thanks to the well-organized interface, and naturally creates incentives to build smaller villages that do one specific thing as well as warehouses and waystations to speed things up. My cheese island is quite far away, so I noticed my trade ships spent half their time sailing across Albion. But if I set up a colony close to it that's basically just a cheese warehouse and some subsistence fisheries, I can constantly be moving cheese there with intra-region trade ships to be picked up at the edge of the map all at once. I adore this kind of logistics stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anno 117 is a pretty good RTS, too. I'm especially a fan of its naval combat, which I had to master quickly to protect my trade routes from increasingly vicious pirates. Maneuvering ships feels weighty and realistic, with differences in maneuverability based on whether they rely on sails, oars, or both, and I eventually got pretty good at maneuvers like trapping a sneaky little pirate ship in a cove where there would be no escape.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's a pretty good RTS, too, and I'm especially a fan of its naval combat.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ground combat is just fine. It does its job, with a small selection of melee, ranged, and siege units that can fulfill a handful of different roles. It's possible to succeed without ever getting into a land battle if you have a good navy, but in the few cases where I did, I found some interesting tactics to dig into. It feels like a real RTS at least, as opposed to a half-baked minigame, which I really appreciate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Diplomacy is pretty basic stuff, with a single interesting wrinkle in that the Emperor works a bit differently. You can't really make treaties with him, but he will make demands of you, and succeeding, failing, or refusing affects your reputation with Rome. When he likes you, you get bonuses. When he doesn't, you get penalties. But both ends of the scale culminate in some very powerful rewards. Either you play nice and get appointed Consul, or you defy his authority so effectively that you grant yourself Proconsular authority, Caesar-style.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 City Builders</h3><p>I just reviewed Cities: Skylines 2, so let's take a look back and rank the best city builders over the ages.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a decent story campaign, but it's really more of an extended tutorial. It took me less than 10 hours to finish and only really scratches the surface of the mechanics you can play with in endless mode. You can play as either Marcus or Marcia, with the latter being a sort of madcap "Weekend at Bernicus’" scenario where you are taking on the governor duties of your totally-not-dead husband. It's hardly Shakespeare, but there's some interesting intrigue going on and a cast of memorable characters. The Canaanite Ben-Baalion was a particularly endearing companion who presented me with an emotionally satisfying choice at the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you can continue from the ending of the campaign as long as you want, most of my playtime was spent in the endless mode, which lets you start in either Albion or Latium and offers a wide range of difficulty options. You can even pick from a set of rival governors with different personalities and playstyles. I don't think they necessarily play by the same rules that you do as a player, however. Looking at some late game cities they built… I honestly don't know what's going on. But they can be compelling adversaries or valuable trade partners nonetheless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are still some classic Anno issues kicking around, like the fact that very large economies can become unwieldy and are prone to death spirals. If food is disrupted, population drops, which causes food buildings to become underemployed, leading to even less food and even more population drop. At one point I had to restart because I accidentally changed a large city's patron god, which made it instantly insolvent and nearly irrecoverable due to lost agricultural bonuses. But trade is kind of the hero here once again, since setting up buy orders for whatever you're out of can bail you out of a lot of tricky spots as long as you have cash. It's a little fiddly setting up a lot of different trades at a lot of different harbors the first time, but the interface is easy to work with, and once things were set, I didn't find I had to mess with them very often.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/anno-117-pax-romana-review]]></content:encoded>
