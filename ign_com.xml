            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/terminator-2d-no-fate">Terminator 2D: No Fate</a> is packed with Terminator references and Easter eggs, but this one is perhaps for hardcore fans only.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bitmap Bureau’s retro action game has an Easter egg that can only be accessed once you’ve unlocked its hardest mode, Judgment Day. Once you’ve done that, play through the game on Judgment Day difficulty and reach the Biker Bar level, which is only the second level in Arcade Mode if you want to get there quickly. The instant the level loads, you’ll immediately notice that the previously naked Arnie is now wearing some very bright, ultra ‘90s neon Zubaz shorts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why is he doing that? It’s a reference to how The Governator actually dressed on-set during the filming of the biker bar scene in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. That’s right: naked Arnie in Terminator 2 is a lie, and you can get a glimpse of those incredibly colourful shorts in this footage from behind the scenes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We thought we’d check in with the Terminator 2D development team to find out more about this cheeky Easter egg, and they explained how it came together:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When planning the game we did a lot of research on the movie; watching it scene-by-scene, going through materials such as the illustrated screenplay and also looking at making of content which is where the shorts idea came from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After looking at how some of the older T2 games handled the naked Terminator for the bar scene (for example in the SNES game where it was behind a strategically placed wooden fence) — Mike [Tucker, designer] jokingly had the idea of making a pixelated crotch effect for Easy Money mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But we decided the shorts from behind-the-scenes pics would be a hilarious Easter egg and you can only unlock it on the Judgment Day difficulty!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/gettyimages-1203004089-1766144042028.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ohhh, that's a bad idea, fella! Photo by CBS via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We also had an internal thread where we gathered ideas for Easter eggs to include, and we managed to fit plenty of them into the game. For example, retro game lovers may enjoy the custom ending of Arcade Mode which we hope is a nice reward for sticking with that challenge and completing it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For the biker bar level itself, we made a lot of adjustments throughout the development as we continued to polish. Like adding the two licensed music tracks, adding the boss fight, the guy getting griddled, giving the Terminator a line asking for clothes, boots and motorcycle, the waitress idle animations etc and then we added a few more moves such as the backfist, headbutt, and shoulder barge for depth.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So there you have it! That’s why the Terminator is wearing retro shorts in Terminator 2D: No Fate, and if you didn’t already know about its origins, now you have some fun movie trivia to impress your film buff friends with!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Terminator Movies in (Chronological) Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Arnie's shorts aren't the only call-back to Terminator 2. In June, IGN reported on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/maker-of-new-terminator-2-video-game-tracked-down-actor-who-played-future-war-john-connor-back-in-1991-to-include-his-likeness"><u>how the developers tracked down the actor who played future war John Connor back in 1991 to include his likeness</u></a>, and in doing so found out why Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-2d-no-fate-review">Terminator 2D: No Fate review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Terminator 2D: No Fate is a wonderfully realised tribute to one of the single greatest movies ever made, punctuated with pitch-perfect music, exquisite pixel art, and brilliant Easter eggs.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in Terminator movie news, creator James Cameron has said he plans to make a new film once the dust has settled on Avatar: Fire and Ash, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-safely-say-he-wont-be-in-it-james-cameron-says-arnold-schwarzeneggers-time-as-the-terminator-is-officially-over-as-he-plots-new-movie">but insisted Arnold Schwarzenegger's time as The Terminator is officially over</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Doomed Xbox blockbuster <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled">Perfect Dark</a> had "entire chapters" of performance capture work in the can before its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">shock cancelation this summer</a>, according to Joanna Dark actress Alix Wilton Regan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/joanna-dark-perfect-dark-reboot-cancellation-details/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheGamer</a>, the voice behind Dragon Age's Inquisitor and Cyberpunk 2077's Alt Cunningham says she recorded scenes for The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot over the course of several years, beginning in 2023. "Lots" was done in 2024, with work continuing in early 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To my knowledge, we were pretty far along, I'd done entire chapters of this universe," Regan said, adding that she was shocked to learn that Microsoft was pulling the plug, with The Initiative itself also set to be closed down as part of a wave of funding cuts and layoffs. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else was when the funding was pulled, and the studio was closed," Wilton-Regan continued, saying she learned the studio's fate at the same time as it was announced publicly. "I did not see it coming. I was absolutely blindsided when the project was defunded," she added. "It was devastating. So many people lost their jobs. An entire workforce was disbanded."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A further blow would come as last-ditch talks to salvage the project also fell through — a process Wilton-Regan admits she had insider knowledge of. Interestingly, the actress mentioned that Perfect Dark may have changed in scope had it been saved, with a "slimmed-down" version ultimately seeing the light of day instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I couldn't say too much about it because I knew The Initiative was in talks to keep Perfect Dark up and running in some shape or form," Wilton-Regan revealed. "Possibly a slimmed-down version, possibly something slightly different. But certainly, everyone was working really hard behind the scenes to bring Perfect Dark back. And then one day, I heard from the creative director that the deal hadn't gone through, and that really everything had fallen apart, and production was fully stopping."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Perfect Dark Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report from Bloomberg</a>, which IGN corroborated from its own sources, previously revealed that there had been a plan to keep Perfect Dark alive via the team working on the project at Tomb Raider studio Crystal Dynamics, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-initiative-is-teaming-up-with-crystal-dynamics-to-develop-the-new-perfect-dark-game">which had been serving as a co-developer</a>. Leadership from both Crystal and The Initiative reportedly spent two months looking for a new publisher and funding source. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While multiple parties expressed interest, the most likely candidate turned out to be Take-Two Interactive. However, the two groups couldn't come to an agreement, at least in part due to disagreements over long-term ownership of the property. As a result, the deal fell through, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-more-following-perfect-dark-cancelation">resulting in layoffs</a> at Crystal Dynamics as all hope of the project being reinstated vanished.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-hires-former-perfect-dark-leads-for-brand-new-2k-studio">Perfect Dark studio head Darrell Gallagher and director Brian Horton had now been hired by 2K</a> to start a brand new outfit. No details have yet emerged as to what the new studio will work on, or if any other former Perfect Dark employees joined them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Wilton-Regan, while she may have lost the Joanna Dark gig, this month's big Tomb Raider reveal at The Game Awards revealed that the actress was now the official new video game Lara Croft. She'll star in next year's reimagining of the original Lara Croft adventure, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis"><u>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</u></a>, as well as all-new blockbuster <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-catalyst">Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a>, due in 2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
