            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a Pokémon Trainer or have one in your life, today's Daily Deals is going to save you a small fortune. From the best Pokémon TCG bargains to a great deal on the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, I've got you. You can also check out my more comprehensive list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-gift-ideas-2025">best Pokémon gifts for 2025</a> for more options than what I've listed here.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Top Pokémon Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've even taken the liberty of finding the best deals on the top chase cards for every Pokémon TCG expansion in the Mega Evolution and Scarlet &amp; Violet eras, so you can pick up some awesome chase cards instead of busting a bag full of Pokédollars on booster packs. I even found some awesome Pokémon Squishmallow deals to boot, so let's get straight into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Single Card Price Crash</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG stock levels are getting better and better across the board, which means there's more chance of buying off store shelves and a much bigger chance of scalpers losing out. It's a win-win, especially for Pokémon card collectors, as single cards are finding a new floor when it comes to market values.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the best time this year to snap up some of those grails you've been eyeing up, so I've found the top 5 chase cards in every Pokémon TCG expansion and base set from the previous Scarlet and Violet era, as well as Mega Evolution, the current era of Pokémon cards. There's some serious bargains to be had here, and I reckon we'll see prices tick back up when Ascended Heroes launches early next year, so don't wait around.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Best Pokémon TCG Sealed Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best deal here for me is the Mega Charizard X ex Ultra Premium Collection that's currently at market value on Amazon and close to MSRP. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>4 x Phantasmal Flames</li><li>4 x Mega Evolution</li><li>4 x Destined Rivals</li><li>4 x Journey Together</li><li>2 x Surging Sparks</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The main pull of this UPC is the Mega Charizard X ex Mega Attack Rare and Oricorio ex SIR promo cards, which, frankly, are the best couple of promo cards we've had in a big box collection for a while. It also contains Mega Charizard X-themed card sleeves, deck box, damage counter dice, playmat, and a metal coin.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Legends: Z-A and More Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Need to get Pokémon Legends: Z-A sorted for Christmas? Here's the cheapest way: the Nintendo Switch 1 version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A for $44.99 on Woot, then upgrade it to the Switch 2 version for $9.99 via the Amazon digital code service. You're saving $15 over buying the usual Switch 2 copy of Legends: Z-A.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Woot also has more discounts on top Pokémon Switch games, such as Legends: Arceus alongside Scarlet and Violet. It's a great time to build up your library if you've got a few Pokémon-sized gaps on your shelf.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Squishmallow Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nothing beats cuddling a Squishmallow, and I'll admit that to anyone. Well, getting a $69.99 massive 20-inch Sprigatito Squishmallow for $37.99 definitely beats that feeling, but there's some great deals on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-plushies">best Pokémon plushies</a> right now (in my opinion, which is correct).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

It puts a lens up to its next project with a little less than 23 minutes of footage, showcasing the PvPvE FPS’s world and gameplay while doing its best to answer two major questions: How much will Marathon cost, and when is it coming out?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie says its “target pricing” is currently $39.99, a price point that puts it on par with the recently released (and massively successful) extraction shooter from Embark Studios, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>. Additional details on the Marathon package are hazy for now, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-has-completed-its-37-billion-deal-to-acquire-bungie-and-welcome-it-into-the-playstation-family">the PlayStation studio</a> only telling buyers to expect access to all gameplay updates – including maps, Runner shells, events, and more – “as the year progresses.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie adds that reward passes will not expire, with players able to purchase past passes and earn their rewards at any time. Those worried about potential pay-to-win mechanics have been assured that they have nothing to fear, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Finally, and most importantly, we believe in preserving competitive integrity in Marathon, so survival will never come down to how much money you spend," the studio said in <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post today</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’ll share more about our plans for seasonal content, a roadmap, and details about when you’ll be able to try the game as we get closer to launch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie had previously set a Marathon release date of September 23, 2025, before what it called “strong and clear” feedback from players related to an April alpha test <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-delayed-as-bungie-promises-to-reveal-new-release-date-this-fall"><u>resulted in an indefinite delay</u></a>. At the time, Sony laid out a plan to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026"><u>see the new extraction shooter launch before March 2026</u></a>, with Bungie now doubling down on that plan today with a firmer March 2026 release window for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S. The exact release date remains a mystery for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Marathon ViDoc also includes loads of fresh gameplay showing how its dark sci-fi world will have players fighting tooth and nail to survive. Bungie wants Runners to feel the pressure when scavenging Tau Ceti IV, so it’s made changes to immerse players with realistic weather and updated environmental storytelling in a world it’s calling “dark, gritty, and grounded.” Other recent additions include proximity chat, a solo queue option, a Rook shell with a limited loadout, and increased visual fidelity and updated UI.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Bungie shows off its progress, the video also serves as a much-needed side-by-side for players to see what has changed since feedback resulted in that hefty delay earlier this year. The studio says more updates will arrive in the coming months, telling players to expect the next update in January.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for that elusive Marathon release date, you can read about why Sony was willing to admit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-concords-failure-and-marathons-delay-sony-admits-playstations-live-service-strategy-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly"><u>its live-service strategy wasn’t panning out as it had hoped</u></a>.
