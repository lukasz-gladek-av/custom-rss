            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-bananza-first-hands-on-preview.1154169/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-first-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We're going bananas for this long-awaited 3D Donkey Kong game.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">For the last several years it’s felt like Nintendo just hasn’t cared that much about Donkey Kong. As Nintendo gifted pretty much every one of its cherished characters their best outing <em>ever </em>on Switch, the great ape who once stood high atop the girders of Nintendo’s essential arcade cabinet faceplanted hard on the concrete with a litany of ports, remakes, and remasters. But on Switch 2, Nintendo is finally giving one of gaming’s biggest icons the love he deserves with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2">brand new, flagship, launch window 3D action-platformer</a>, and if the first 30 minutes we spent with Donkey Kong Bananza are any indication, Mario’s original rival is looking poised to stand tall once again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to talk about Bananza without referencing that darn plumber as just seconds after jumping into its Underground World, the significant parallels to Super Mario Odyssey became abundantly clear. While Nintendo hasn’t confirmed the developers of Bananza, after playing it we’re willing to bet Odyssey developer Nintendo EPD Tokyo is behind it. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bananza’s setup will feel instantly familiar to anyone who’s spent hours throwing Cappy and collecting Power Moons. DK is joined by an adorable assistant (this time in the form of a purple rock who talks and sings) to scour self-contained explorable sandboxes for Golden Bananas, some of which are found by completing story missions while others are sprinkled across the landscape just waiting to be found. As you explore, you find isolated linear challenge rooms that dial back the exploration in favor of testing your combat and platforming abilities. There are other collectibles to find too, like gold presumably playing the role of coins, dozens of fossils (which we didn’t find a use for during our demo) and currency  we’re hoping will be used to outfit Donkey Kong in the local flavor. Even the UI is reminiscent of Mario’s globetrotting adventure! So if you were disappointed  the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct lacked a big, flashy 3D Mario, I'm here to tell you that Donkey Kong Bananza feels like the sequel to that formula we’ve been clamoring for, it just happens to star the giant monkey instead.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Wrecking Crew</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the best Nintendo games, Donkey Kong’s brand new moveset completely suits him as a character and feels right the moment you step into his shoes (okay, big hairy feet). Bananza is furiously fast and delightfully destructive as Donkey Kong can demolish most of the terrain in his path, and we spent our demo transforming the lush opening area filled with grass, trees, and lakes into DK’s personal chaotic excavation site. DK punches forward, upward, and downward, instantly destroying most materials and oftentimes carving a makeshift path to follow that can lead to entirely new areas. At one point I was punching through a mountain just for the heck of it and a valuable collectible fell into my lap, so there’s definitely value to breaking ground everywhere you can – it may lead to a groundbreaking discovery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If pulverizing every stone wall in sight sounds overwhelming, it really didn’t feel that way in the moment, which is likely due to how much fun we had controlling Donkey Kong. In addition to turning everything to rubble, Donkey Kong can also pick up giant stone boulders from the ground, walls, or wherever, and hurl them to obliterate nearby enemies. Or, he takes a page out of Link’s book and can use the stone slab to boogie board at a rapid pace across the landscape. There are surely dozens of unique moves and chain combos waiting to be discovered and I can imagine how much fun speedrunners will have trying to master DK’s moveset, which already feels ripe with expressiveness and possibility. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 - Donkey Kong Bananza</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bananza’s central theme of exploration via destruction was present throughout every second of our demo, even down to the map screen. Instead of a simple top-down overview of the landscape, the map here is a fully-rendered 3D model of the entire area <em>in its current state, </em>meaning when you pause to get your bearings, you can see all of the walls you’ve punched and caves you’ve carved. It’s like the Hero’s Path feature in Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom cranked up to 11, and it felt like an incredibly impressive touch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That map helped us track down challenge rooms which rewarded us either with Golden Bananas or a ton of cash. And unlike Odyssey, there’s no more wondering if you have a Moon left to find and going inside to wait for Cappy to tell you, because the entrance to each bonus room tracks how many Golden Bananas you’ve found and how many more are waiting within. We saw three of these rooms in Bananza’s opening area, with each focusing on either platforming, combat, or destruction: we had to monkey bar our way through an obstacle course, take down three stone enemies before time ran out, and blast through as much gold ore as possible to take home a big payday. They were all fun and unique and left me excited to see what other challenges are in store.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct April 2025 Games</h3><p>Every game shown in Nintendo's April 2 Nintendo Switch 2 reveal direct event.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I also think Bananza is on track to be one of the most gorgeous Nintendo games I’ve seen. It really does take advantage of Switch 2's hardware – the environments are beautiful and DK’s animations are wonderfully expressive, and I left feeling like the next generation of first-party Nintendo games had truly arrived.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza is out July 17 for $69.99, and I might destroy my entire house if I have to wait that long to play it again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Logan Plant is the host of Nintendo Voice Chat and IGN's Database Manager &amp; Playlist Editor. He played the entire Donkey Kong Country series earlier this year and is so excited for a brand new DK game. It's way overdue!</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/we-played-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After years of speculation, months of leaks, and weeks since its official reveal, the Nintendo Switch 2 finally has a price and a release date… And we’ve actually held it and played it. Read on for our first impressions of the Switch 2’s build quality, screen, mouse mode, and more. Since two of us here at IGN got to spend a ton of time with it, we figured we’d both take turns telling you all about it, like we’re two friends sitting next to you on a couch. Hey buddy! Wanna hear about Nintendo Switch 2?</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Switch 2 Screen: LCD vs OLED (and Docked Performance)</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brian Altano: </strong>Let’s start with the Switch 2 screen since it’s the thing you’re gonna look at the most, unless you plan on playing entirely in docked mode or you drop your device on the floor and decide to never pick it up again, which would be weird and rude. Unlike the first Nintendo Switch, Switch 2 won’t have an OLED option at launch (admittedly kind of a bummer!) but it’s probably so Nintendo can keep costs down and eventually get us to upgrade to a Switch 2 OLED in a few years, so hey, it sort of makes sense for now. That said, Switch 2 has a 1080p screen in handheld mode which immediately looks way better than Switch 1’s 720p non-OLED screen did. Colors pop and look vibrant and most of the games we played run smooth and at a consistent framerate in handheld mode, so it’s not a total dealbreaker here. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, Switch 2 is capable of 4K and HDR docked, or up to 120FPS in some games (just never all of those things at once) so you’ll get better looking and playing games this time around either way, plus better looking upgrades of many of your old Switch games. We walked into our hands-on preview expecting to miss the OLED display but walked out completely satisfied with the Switch 2’s LCD, so it’s not the end of the world for Nintendo fans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Logan Plant: </strong>Even better though, the games we played docked looked great on televisions, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nintendo-switch-2-will-improve-switch-1-games">Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of original Switch games</a> like Tears of the Kingdom, Breath of the Wild, and Metroid Prime 4. This is the version of Breath of the Wild we wanted at launch, with no noticeable slowdown whatsoever in moments that taxed the original Switch hardware, like when Link set everything on fire and it felt like my Switch was going to burst into flames. The Switch 2 dock has a built-in fan, so that should help keep things cool and maintain performance in TV mode. Switch 2-exclusive games like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza looked gorgeous too, and both feel like great showcases of Nintendo’s timeless art direction running great on newer hardware. We’re a little worried about the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tech-specs-battery-life-4k-and-up-to-120fps-storage-and-more">listed battery life of 2 - 6.5 hours</a>, but that number honestly makes sense given how good the performance was in handheld mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until we really get some significant time with the console along with finished versions of the games, it’s tough to say exactly how long the battery will last, but one thing that almost certainly won’t change before Switch 2 launches on June 5th is the actual design of the hardware itself...</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Altano: </strong>One of my biggest issues with the original Nintendo Switch was the build quality. Joy-Con drift aside, the system itself just felt a bit wobbly at times. Joy-Con and anything else you attached to the console felt loose, the kickstand was flimsy, and the launch dock literally scratched the screen. That all feels largely improved with Nintendo Switch 2 from what we played so far. Overall the system feels much more sturdy and much less like a fancy toy like Switch 1 did, with sleek ergonomic design and no Joy-Con wobble. It’s got a nice weight to it and holding it side by side with a Steam Deck (which we literally did) makes it feel lighter and less bulky. Sticks, triggers, and buttons all feel great too, as does the d-pad. We didn’t get to play any 2D games like twitchy sidescrolling platformers or classic fighters, but the d-pad feels like it will hopefully be better for them. Buttons have that nice clicky feel they had on Switch 1 but feel slightly softer and are slightly bigger. This is definitely a system aimed for an older audience than the first Nintendo Switch, and not just because of the premium price tag. It doesn’t even have a fun, kid friendly alternate colorway available at launch like Nintendo usually does, just dark gray with some muted colors hidden inside the Joy-Con 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Plant: </strong>Speaking of the Joy-Con 2, the sticks feel nice and smooth to rotate, but Nintendo isn’t saying yet if they’re Hall-effect joysticks, which was a frustrating omission from the hardware overview in the Direct. Presumably they’ve done whatever it takes to avoid Joy-Con drift again this time around, but until players really start putting the Switch 2 through its paces, there’s no real way of knowing if Mario will slowly start walking to the left as time goes on and wear and tear impact the performance of your controllers. In general, the new and improved Joy-Con 2 controllers look better, feel better, and the way they snap on and off feels immensely satisfying. Brian and I took turns clicking them on and off the Switch 2 unit dozens of times which probably made us both look like we were a little bit crazy, but it really is a noticeable upgrade. When we first heard they’d be using magnets to attach the Joy-Con there were a lot of concerns they’d be flimsy, but so far they’re the total opposite. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct April 2025 Games</h3><p>Every game shown in Nintendo's April 2 Nintendo Switch 2 reveal direct event.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there are the brand new mouse control options for certain games, which worked surprisingly well – especially with the haptic feedback with each “click” of the shoulder button. In select games, you can turn the Joy-Con sideways and drag them across a flat, smooth surface to mimic the functions of a PC mouse, and it feels like a classic “weird, innovative, and very fun” Nintendo design decision. We used these controls in a variety of ways like aiming in Metroid Prime 4, playing air hockey in Mario Party, and trying out tech demo-like minigames in the odd new Switch 2 Welcome Tour game, and they were largely responsive. Metroid smartly lets you swap back and forth between pointer controls and mouse controls seamlessly without having to go into settings to change them, and I could see mouse controls becoming the preferred way for a lot of people to play Prime 4 – as long as you have easy access to a flat surface. It can sometimes feel awkward – I wish the Joy-Con 2 was just a bit wider as a mouse and I occasionally had to crane my pointer finger or thumb at a weird angle to hit a face button – but the improved aiming precision felt worth these small concessions. The Joy-Con 2 straps even have mouse feet – those little rubber bumpers on the bottom of your PC mouse that I had to Google the name of because I’ve gone my entire life never needing to know what they were called until today.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Kickstand, C-Button, Built-in Mic, and Accessories</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Altano: </strong>There are also some less immediately noticeable additions on Switch 2 that you’ll probably end up using for a bunch of things. The new kickstand feels significantly improved over the launch Switch model from 2017. It can practically lay flat and move to almost any viewing angle and doesn’t feel like it’s going to instantly snap off. I think I still slightly prefer the Switch OLED’s flat panel kickstand over this one, but time will tell. Meanwhile, we didn’t get to launch anything with the new C-button tucked under the right Joy-Con 2’s home button, but it’s a nice inclusion and is largely used to pull up Game Chat and video interactions. We did get to play some Mario Party minigames with the new camera peripheral, though, which is sold separately for $50. It placed fuzzy versions of us into warp pipes and cropped out our backgrounds like we were on a Zoom call, except instead of our bosses getting mad at us for the typos in this article, Bowser breathed fire on us. Other third-party cameras will be supported by Switch 2 in case you have a couple of those sitting around and don’t want to buy a new one on launch day alongside a $450 Switch 2 and an $80 Mario Kart World (or $50 if you get the $500 bundle with the console, but you see my point).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Plant: </strong>Then there’s the Switch 2’s built in microphone which we literally only tested by seeing which of our Mario Party teams could yell the loudest, but ideally you’ll use it for much more normal things like casual voice chat between Switch 2 friends while you’re sitting on the couch. You’ll also be able to hear them talk via the newly added headphone jack on the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller (or just regular in-game audio… Right, Nintendo? Right?!) and it’s just one of the many things that feels better about the new Pro Controller. It’s even got programmable GL and GR back buttons, a feature that has become pretty common with controllers on other consoles, and while we didn’t get to assign functions to them during our preview, they were nice and clicky. It’s also got amiibo support and new Zelda and Street Fighter amiibo were announced this week, so if you collect amiibo, get ready for your third console generation of buying amiibo.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Is Switch 2 Worth the Upgrade?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Altano: </strong>Okay, so it’s tough to say if this system will do Switch 1 numbers worldwide. Switch 1 had a ton of factors in its favor, like a $300 price tag and an open world Zelda at launch, a mountain of Wii U ports that were brand new games to most people, and a global pandemic that made a bunch of people get back into video games for the first time in a while. But Switch 1 is the second best-selling video game console ever made so hey, that’s a lofty goal. Ultimately it’s a steady software lineup that keeps Nintendo consoles successful, but factors like press make a big difference too, and a $450 launch price might be a bit steep for people wanting to impulsively buy a new system for themselves or their kids or for people who are just happy enough with their original Switch model. But tech wise, Switch 2 solves a lot of the problems that Switch 1 had. A bunch of older Switch games look better on it, it’s got a really fun new and exclusive Mario Kart game, and holding the console made me want to take it home immediately. I’m a longtime Nintendo fan so I was probably always going to be there on day one but this system feels like the kind of thing I want to play games on and travel with for years to come. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Plant: </strong>Switch 2 is a more premium product and the price tag reflects that. It’s also a better version of a great thing, and it’s trying to pull off a bunch of cool new tricks at the same time, like mouse controls. Obviously we’re both buying Switch 2 on day one, and I did really love our hands-on time with the console. But I’ll be honest and say I have some concerns about if the general public is willing to adopt a $450 Nintendo console with an $80 Mario Kart. It’s a big ask for a company that traditionally targets families and younger players, and I feel like the high cost of entry limits the Switch 2’s potential to take off in the way its predecessor did. But for those of you that do decide to take the plunge, you’ll be getting what’s shaping up to be a great hybrid console that makes a ton of worthwhile improvements on the original Switch and adds some fun bells and whistles for good measure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Switch 2 is out on June 5th for $450. We’ve got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-72-new-game-details-mario-kart-9-the-duskbloods-and-more">tons more Switch 2 coverage ahead here on IGN</a>, including hands-on with Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Brian Altano and Logan Plant are two of IGN's biggest Nintendo superfans, and you can hear them geek out about Switch 2 and Nintendo games on Nintendo Voice Chat.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Even in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tech-specs-battery-life-4k-and-up-to-120fps-storage-and-more">the official Nintendo Switch 2 tech specs</a> there is only confirmation that the console uses a “custom processor” made by Nvidia, and no more detail.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a hardware-focused roundtable Q&amp;A in New York yesterday, attended by IGN, Nintendo representatives confirmed the Switch 2 uses DLSS, but did not specify which version of the tech, or whether it had been customized for Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Takuhiro Dohta, senior director of the Programming Management Group Entertainment Planning &amp; Development Department, at Nintendo’s Entertainment Planning &amp; Development Division, confirmed:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We use DLSS upscaling technology and that's something that we need to use as we develop games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And when it comes to the hardware, it is able to output to a TV at a max of 4K.

But I do believe that our partner Nvidia will be sharing some information.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In January, the internet spotted a patent, filed July 2023 but published for the first time earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-ramp-up-as-new-patent-suggests-ai-image-upscaling-tech">that describes AI image upscaling technology</a> that would help keep video game download sizes small enough to fit on a physical game cartridge while offering up to 4K textures. The patent describes technology similar to Nvidia's DLSS, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation 5 Pro</u></a>'s PSSR, to upscale images using AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">everything announced at the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive">what the experts have to say about the Switch 2 price and Mario Kart World’s $80 price tag</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

That’s a staggering 122% markup, and with demand still outpacing supply, even Amazon has hiked its prices well above retail.</p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="218089"><div id="218089" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The availability is still good, as you’re not fighting bots or hoping your local store remembered to stock anything. This is probably your best shot today that doesn’t involve rolling the dice with potential scams through third-party sellers. Still, if you do decide to buy, do it with a fair warning that this is a heavily increased price. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">My Favorite Prismatic Evolutions Single Cards</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review">Prismatic Evolutions</a> is stacked. This is an Eeveelution collector’s dream (and a wallet’s nightmare). The Special Illustration Rare cards in this set are already climbing to jaw-dropping prices on resale sites.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The single card market, however, is a different story. Prices are slowly coming down, with Dragapult ex coming right down from over $100 to around $45 alongside Roaring Moon ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umbreon ex (161/131) is the crown jewel, going for a laughable $1,298 in lightly played condition. It’s absurd, but it’s exactly the kind of pull that justifies ripping packs like a gremlin. Sylveon ex (156/131) isn’t far behind, selling around $450 depending on condition, and Espeon ex (155/131) continues the psychic-type price madness with listings near $300. Some sellers are offering copies in the $90 range, but blink and those are gone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jolteon ex (153/131) brings the lightning with prices hovering around $265 for near mint, although listings under $100 do pop up — briefly. And then there's the rest of the Eevee family: Vaporeon, Flareon, Glaceon, and Leafeon ex are all pulling serious numbers, with some copies going well over $250, and even the “low” end listings still sitting in the $75–$100 range.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it’s not just about the Eeveelutions. Pikachu ex (179/131) might be one of the few heavy hitters in this set that’s still hovering under $100, currently around $70, but Pikachu is never a bad pull recently. Roaring Moon ex and Dragapult ex round out the list of top chase cards. Both are popular picks, with prices ranging from $45 to $200 depending on the condition and the whims of the secondary market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
