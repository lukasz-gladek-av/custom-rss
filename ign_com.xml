            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-adds-new-faction-illuminate-in-omens-of-tyranny-update-and-its-out-now-the-game-awards-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Another dimension, another dimension.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> developer Arrowhead has announced and released the long-awaited Illuminate update, dubbed Omens of Tyranny.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unveiled during The Game Awards 2024, Helldivers 2 has expanded to herald the Illuminate invasion of Super Earth planets in the galactic south. This initial alien force brings with it a number of new enemies to fight against as well as brand new Super Earth colonies to fight on. These colonies introduce Helldivers 2’s first urban environments, with city streets packed with innocent civilians who are mind-controlled by the Illuminate. The Voteless, as they’re called by Super Earth, are little more than zombies who want nothing more than to team players limb from limb.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN, game director Mikael Eriksson said this initial invasion involves the Illuminate Vanguard Fleet and does not appear to be the full faction. Initially, the Illuminate won’t capture planets, rather they are using guerrilla tactics. Eriksson wouldn’t say what they’re up to, but did tease that players will get the chance to influence the ongoing Illuminate invasion as part of a new story set to take place over the course of several months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eriksson also discussed the main differences between fighting the Illuminate and the bots and bugs. One is that the Illuminate are “more difficult,” and fighting against them in urban environments feels constrained compared to fighting the Automatons and the Terminids in open, more naturalistic environments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Illuminate themselves are like demi-gods, with huge walking trip-pod enemies called Harvesters that can one-shot you. On top of that, there’s horde-style gameplay with the mind-controlled civilians to contend with. However, players have a number of new toys to help defend against the Illuminate threat, chief among them Helldivers 2’s first vehicle, the Fast Recon Vehicle (FRV).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The FRV, which initially can only be found at various spots on the map, houses a full squad of players: one driving (manual by default but automatic via accessibility settings), two in passenger seats with lean out and shoot functionality, and one manning the rear turret. The FRV will only be fully unlocked as a stratagem you can call in if and when the Helldivers 2 community completes a new major order, thus making it available to buy in the traditional fashion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eriksson recommended players bring anti-tank stratagems to help take down the Illuminate spawn ships, encounter ships, and the Harvester enemies, all of which have shields (the new Anti-Tank Emplacement defensive stratagem will prove useful). You’ll need support weapons good against the horde; Eriksson suggested an assault rifle. And it’s a good idea to use the FRV to zip around the maps, particularly on city roads.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Helldivers II: Omens of Tyranny Game Awards Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Illuminate join the bugs and bots as Helldivers 2’s third enemy faction, and are set to breathe new life into the explosive third-person co-op action game. Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time, having shifted an incredible 12 million copies in just 12 weeks following its February launch. Arrowhead has endured a number of controversies in the 10 months since, including a review bomb campaign over publisher Sony’s decision to force Steam gamers to log in to a PSN account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s continued to update the game, adding new content and issuing balance changes that have seen recent Steam user reviews hit ‘overwhelmingly positive.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out IGN's round-up of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2024</a> for more on what's coming to the world of gaming in the years ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It's Naughty Dog's first new franchise in over a decade, and is currently in development for the PlayStation 5. No release window was mentioned.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/12/announcing-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-a-new-franchise-from-naughty-dog/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, Druckmann revealed that Naughty Dog has been working on Intergalactic since 2020, and confirmed the main character is played by Tati Gabrielle (Jo Braddock in the 2022 Uncharted movie).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Intergalactic stars our newest protagonist, Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago," Druckmann explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In fact, anyone who’s flown to it hoping to unravel its mysterious past was never heard from again. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Beyond that, we’re keeping everything about the story under wraps – at least for now. What we can tell you is that this game lives up to the Naughty Dog tradition of creating an emotional, character-driven epic journey. Our narrative goals are rivaled only by our gameplay ambitions. This will be the deepest gameplay in Naughty Dog’s history, taking our learnings from our previous franchises and pushing them beyond anything we’ve ever done before.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Jordan is played by the talented Tati Gabrielle, who leads a stellar cast (pun intended!). Eagle-eyed players might spot some of the other cast members in the trailer. We’ll reveal more of our ensemble down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our incredible voyage into the cosmos also needs an equally incredible soundtrack. As tremendous fans of their work, I’m excited to announce our collaboration with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who’ll be scoring Intergalactic! The guys are cooking, and the trailer is just a small tease of their work for the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We know you’re eager for more – and trust us, we’re very eager to share more with you. For now, though, it’s time to put our heads back down and keep cranking away on Jordan’s adventure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out IGN's round-up of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2024</a> for more on what's coming to the world of gaming in the years ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

While it occupies a place within the existing Mafia universe, Mafia: The Old Country tells a brand new story with a new cast of characters about the origin of the mafia itself. You play a new, original protagonist called Enzo, who survived a childhood of indentured labor in Sicily’s sulfur mines to join Don Torrisi's crime family.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Structurally, Mafia: The Old Country is a “focused package”, a “cinematic experience” set in an authentic representation of 1900s Sicily. Expect “grounded” stealth and gunplay mechanics. Structurally, Mafia: The Old Country is more aligned to Mafia 1 and Mafia 2 than Mafia 3, which was more open-world oriented).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a summer 2025 release window, Mafia: The Old Country is potentially running up close against the behemoth that is Grand Theft Auto 6, a prospect IGN asked about in a new interview with Hangar 13.
