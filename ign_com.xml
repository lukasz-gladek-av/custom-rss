            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Assassin's Creed series' recent trend of featuring dual protagonists has sometimes been "divisive", the associate game director of this year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has said — acknowledging that the choice between nimble shinobi Naoe and hulking samurai Yasuke  had been a particularly notable example of this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows' development is headed up by Ubisoft Quebec, the studio behind Victoria London-set Assassin's Creed Syndicate and Ancient Greece RPG Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Both also featured dual protagonists, though in different ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The differences between Evie and Jacob were mostly cosmetic," associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/we-are-hard-to-beat-9-months-since-assassins-creed-shadows-its-associate-director-looks-back-on-what-makes-this-rpg-the-best-in-series-history/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar+</a>. "They play very, very similarly, except with very few select skills." Shadows, by comparison, was specifically designed to be "an exercise in contrast" — something that "can split our fan base a little."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These aren't the only Assassin's Creed games to feature multiple protagonists, of course. The Ancient Egypt-set Origins lets you play as both husband and wife Bayek and Aya, even if the latter only gets a sliver of screentime. Viking-era Valhalla also offered male and female versions of hero Eivor, meanwhile, for complicated story-related reasons (but also so Ubisoft could have a man on the game's box).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More than any other Assassin's Creed game before it, however, Shadows' two protagonists are built as different people. Their abilities are different, their combat systems are different, and they are treated as two different yet equal characters to play the game's main quest as.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Dual protagonists can be divisive along very strange lines, right?" Lemay-Comtois said. "It's not just a 'well, I prefer a war, therefore I prefer Yasuke.' Some people just don't like one character over the other, and they don't like to spend time with one. It was true with Evie and Jacob, but with Naoe and Yasuke it's more divisive," he continued. "And we knew this. We knew going into it, but I think it can split our fan base a little too."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With this in mind, will Ubisoft continue offering dual protagonists in future — for example in the upcoming Assassin's Creed Hexe? "I think the learning for us is that, yes, we could do more dual-protagonist games in the future – if we have a good reason to do it narratively and for the setting," Lemay-Comtois concluded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft's next Assassin's Creed project expected to release will be the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-release-date-reportedly-leaked">still-unannounced Black Flag remake that's reportedly set to launch in spring 2026</a>. This features pirate Edward Kenway as its star, with no second mate during the game's main campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Assassin's Creed Shadows, little is known of Ubisoft's plans to support the game through next year. The company had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion">initially expected to release a second major expansion</a>, following this fall's Claws of Awaji, but Ubisoft has said that plans shifted when Shadows was delayed — and now, next year's add-on content will be smaller in nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <guid>1376419</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's almost time to welcome in 2026, the year that we <em>finally </em>get to play Grand Theft Auto 6. But there's still a few days left to celebrate the greatest hits of this year, and that's exactly what the IGN Awards 2025 is here to do. There was a massive stack of great games, movies, and TV shows this year, and we want to honor the very best of the past 12 months of pop-culture. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was the year when the long, long development of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> finally ended, and proved that good things really do come to those who wait. But 2025 was just as much about fresh faces as it was long-awaited sequels, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> from new studio Sandfall Interactive being the topic of at least half of all gaming conversation for most of the year. Over on the big screen, the bluesy horror action of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/sinners">Sinners</a> and the break-neck thrills of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/one-battle-after-another">One Battle After Another</a> had us on the edges of our seats, and in our living rooms we were glued to the twists and turns of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/severance">Severance</a>'s second season and leafing through issues of Batman: Dark Patterns. All of these brilliant titles and more are nominated for one of our end-of-year awards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here we present the full list of nominees for the 2025 IGN Awards. Starting on Monday, December 15, and continuing throughout the week, we will announce the winners of our Best Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo game awards, the Best Movie, Best TV Show, and Best Anime, plus many more categories. This week of awards will culminate on Friday, December 19, where we will reveal IGN’s Game of the Year. Be sure to check back to this page every day, which will be updated with all of the winners as they are announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we start, a note about our platform-specific awards. We've not typically mandated that games on the best PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo shortlists <strong>have </strong>to be platform exclusives, but we've usually tried to choose games that are notably "aligned" with each console. This year, in recognition of shifting industry trends, we've decided that <em>any</em> game published on these platforms is fair game, regardless of exclusivity. The resulting shortlists tell an interesting story about how multi-platform, third-party games shaped each console in 2025 as much as their exclusives.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The IGN Awards are voted for by our content team, who are the people that create everything you read and watch on IGN, from social posts to in-depth reviews and multi-page guides. But we don't just want to tell you what we think was best this year: we want to know what you loved, too. Vote for your favourite games, movies, shows and more in the polls below.  </p><p id="best-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Game of 2025">The Best Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Blue Prince</li><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li><li>Hades 2</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li></ul><p id="best-movie-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Movie of 2025">The Best Movie of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Frankenstein</li><li>KPop Demon Hunters</li><li>One Battle After Another</li><li>Marty Supreme</li><li>Sinners</li><li>Weapons</li></ul><p id="best-tv-show-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best TV Show of 2025">The Best TV Show of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Alien: Earth (season 1)</li><li>Andor (season 2)</li><li>The Pitt (season 1)</li><li>Pluribus (season 1)</li><li>The Rehearsal (season 2)</li><li>Severance (season 2)</li></ul><p id="best-anime-series-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Anime Series of 2025">The Best Anime Series of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Apothecary Diaries (season 2)</li><li>Dan Da Dan (season 2)</li><li>Takopi's Original Sin</li><li>The Summer Hikaru Died</li><li>Zenshu</li></ul><p id="best-comic-book-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Comic Book of 2025">The Best Comic Book or Graphic Novel of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Absolute Wonder Woman</li><li>Assorted Crisis Events</li><li>Batman: Dark Patterns</li><li>Drome</li><li>Ice Cream Man</li></ul><p id="best-playstation-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best PlayStation Game of 2025">The Best PlayStation Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li><li>Dispatch</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li></ul><p id="best-xbox-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Xbox Game of 2025">The Best Xbox Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Keeper</li><li>The Outer Worlds 2</li><li>Split Fiction</li></ul><p id="best-nintendo-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Nintendo Game of 2025">The Best Nintendo Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li><li>Hades 2</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Kirby Air Riders</li><li>Mario Kart World</li></ul><p id="best-pc-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best PC Game of 2025">The Best PC Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Blue Prince</li><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Hades 2</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li></ul><p id="best-rpg-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best RPG of 2025">The Best RPG of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li><li>The Outer Worlds 2</li><li>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</li></ul><p id="best-action-adventure-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Action-Adventure of 2025">The Best Action-Adventure Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Split Fiction</li></ul><p id="best-action-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Action Game of 2025">The Best Action Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The First Berserker: Khazan</li><li>Hades 2</li><li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li><li>Ninja Gaiden 4</li><li>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</li></ul><p id="best-shooter-game-of-2025"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Shooter Game of 2025">The Best Shooter Game of 2025</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Arc Raiders</li><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>Borderlands 4</li><li>Doom: The Dark Ages</li><li>Marvel Rivals*</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">*While Marvel Rivals was released in December 2024, it arrived too late to be considered for last year's IGN Awards.
