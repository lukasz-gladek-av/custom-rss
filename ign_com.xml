I've spent so much time just chilling and exploring the open-world landscape, and it's honestly become a comfort game since I cracked it open. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're after something meaty, with a seriously satisfying gameplay loop and some proper stealth challenge, especially with the new Nightmare difficulties, Assassin's Creed Shadows <em>absolutely</em> delivers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are still some rough edges, but none of it takes away from how immersive and enjoyable it is overall. It’s a beautiful, ambitious Assassin’s Creed game that doesn’t try to please everyone, and I respect it more because of that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-review">IGN’s Jarrett Green review gave it an 8 out of 10</a>, calling Yasuke and Naoe “the strongest Assassin duo in years,” and they’re right. The way Shadows handles combat, story, and seasonal changes across its open world makes it feel more alive than most open-world games manage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At $50, it’s an easy recommendation. And honestly, I’d defend this one even if it weren’t on sale. The fact that it’s cheaper just makes it easier for others to see what I already know: this game is worth your time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other AC news, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-update-106-is-here-check-out-the-patch-notes">Ubisoft's next big patch for Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> recently rolled out on June 25, 2025, and even included the game's next story pack, which introduces a new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-adds-new-ally-character-and-if-you-watch-critical-role-they-may-sound-familiar">Ally character for Naoe and Yasuke played by Critical Role's Robbie Daymond</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Senior Commerce Editor, for IGN.
