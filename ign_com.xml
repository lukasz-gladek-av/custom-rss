            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Light at the end of the tunnel.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Double Fine is poised to release a brand new game called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/keeper">Keeper</a> in October, but what comes after that? According to development chief Tim Schafer, he’s working on multiple projects at the Microsoft-owned studio, none of which are sequels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeper is an atmospheric puzzle adventure in which a long-forgotten lighthouse is awakened and goes on a journey. It’s led by Double Fine’s Lee Petty, which means Tim Schafer is hands-off and free to work on other things.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What are those other things? Speaking to IGN at gamescom 2025, Schafer of course wouldn’t divulge Double Fine’s upcoming games, but did say the studio has multiple projects in the works and they’re all original IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm working on other stuff,” he confirmed. “The studio is doing multiple projects right now and they're all original IPs, because we did Psychonauts 2 and that will hold us for sequels for a while."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, that rules out Psychonauts 3 or — and this was always an unlikely one — Brütal Legend 2, at least in the short to mid-term. As game developers are fond of saying, never say never, but Schafer’s rather definitive comment gives us an idea of what to expect from Double Fine in the coming years — and that is the unexpected.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Psychonauts 2 was Double Fine’s first release following Microsoft’s acquisition of the company in 2019. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psychonauts-2-double-fine-xbox-game-studios-acqusition">Schafer has spoken before about how Double Fine had to cut boss fights from the game due to budget concerns</a>, but the Microsoft buyout meant it had the resources to add them back in. Schafer described Keeper as smaller-scale compared to Psychonauts 2, but with an impressive level of quality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Psychonauts 2 eventually came out in 2021. Now, four years later, Double Fine is about to release its next game. Keeper comes out October 17, 2025, on PC and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Infinity Nikki devs told Eric Barone: "We're still learning from you every day."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/stardew-valley"><u>Stardew Valley</u></a> developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has revealed he doesn't ask for any compensation when his fan-favorite farm sim collabs with other franchises, saying he only does them because "[he] was a fan of the other games, or because [he] genuinely thought players would like it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement comes as fans prepare for a crossover event between Stardew Valley and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/infinity-nikki"><u>Infinity Nikki</u></a>, which goes live on September 1. Although we still don't really understand what this will involve, exactly, there are already some surprisingly mixed reactions coming from the community, with some players upset about the timing, suggesting it's an all-too-convenient <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-is-getting-a-stardew-valley-collab-in-september-but-not-everyone-is-happy-about-it"><u>distraction from the recent controversy around leakers</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There have been a few collaborations between Stardew Valley and other games over the years," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1958574815495037251" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted</u></a> on X/Twitter yesterday. "To be clear, I never receive any money from these collabs. I've only done them because I was a fan of the other games, or because I genuinely thought the players would like it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Infinity Nikki responded directly to Barone from its official X/Twitter account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We really appreciate you sharing your feelings on this. Any unintended stress was the last thing we wanted. It was our way of saying thanks — a free love letter to Stardew Valley from our team and for the community," the message <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1958609280535519445" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Working on it felt like we were all tending a little farm together. The care and detail you pour into your world is exactly why we want to make cozy games too. We're still learning from you every day."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, it feels as though the fallout from the Stardew Valley collab is just a matter of bad timing here. The Infinity Nikki community has been unhappy ever since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-players-threaten-to-uninstall-the-game-as-dev-introduces-controversial-changes-with-update-15"><u>update 1.5</u></a> added some controversial changes to the game, such as retconning Infinity Nikki's story, and ramping up the money and time investments required to collect full outfits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not that Barone does this all that often, either. Stardew Valley has only ever worked with a handful of other games, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/balatro"><u>Balatro</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/terraria"><u>Terraria</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in May, Barone admitted that he "didn't want to just be the Stardew Valley guy," explaining that was why he's currently working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>. We shouldn't expect a release date anytime soon, though — there's "still a lot to be done," Barone recently admitted, particularly as he feels it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-says-he-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2-but-its-so-much-easier-to-add-more-stuff-to-stardew-valley-than-make-a-new-game-from-scratch"><u>"got to be better" than Stardew Valley</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
