            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-players-discover-captured-monsters-will-eventually-just-exit-stage-left<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Most people associate Monster Hunter with actually hunting monsters, but capturing is an important piece of the pie, too. As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> players have discovered, capturing a monster and hanging around long enough can result in a funny little interaction playing out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As shown by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j7olr4/fun_fact_captured_monsters_just_get_up_and_leave/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user RDGtheGreat over on the r/MonsterHunter subreddit</a>, hanging around a captured monster long enough will let you catch a little behind-the-scenes magic. Namely, the monster getting up and leaving.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After capturing a Nu Udra and waiting around, the giant cephalopod just kind of gets up and leaves. Jokes about it all feeling like a wrap on a film set <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j7olr4/comment/mgylnqy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were made a few times over</a>, it's some good fun. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For actual in-universe theories as to why this is happening, well, it's not like the research team has giant cages or anything. Monster Hunter Wilds taking a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j7olr4/comment/mgzf2rm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more catch-and-release approach</a> to their studies certainly seems appropriate, and fits with the general attitude of Alma and the rest throughout the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever the lore reasons are, it's a fun little moment. I find it neat that the developers at Capcom thought this scenario through and planned a little animation, rather than just a fade out. It looks a little silly with this monster, now lacking in several limbs and other appendages, scurrying off into the distance. But it's a neat touch that possibly adds some deeper insight as to how Alma and the crew are conducting their research.</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-10000500-fixes-quest-blockers-among-other-things-but-there-are-no-performance-improvements-yet">Patch 1.000.05.00 just went live for Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, fixing some quest progression blockers and addressing bugs.

Lego has revealed a new Mario Kart Lego set today, March 10, with almost 2,000 pieces and an "18+" age recommendation, arriving on May 15, 2025. It's available to <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wXvkb?object_uuid=dd9b580c-ead5-4882-b0b5-bf79e0f3a7d8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder now at the LEGO Store</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally spotted <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-new-lego-mario-kart-set-aimed-at-adults-has-appeared-online-ahead-of-an-official-announcement/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popping up on some store listings</a>, Lego has officially unveiled the set, which includes both Mario and his Standard Kart from the Mario Kart series. It's a detailed model, meant for display and decor, with a special stand meant to showcase Mario and his kart at various angles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/mario-kart-mario-standard-kart-72037" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lego's site</a>, the company clocks the Mario Kart build at 1,972 pieces with a recommended "18+" Ages rating. This is due to the complexity of the build, it seems, and the intention of the product versus sets meant for play. "This building kit is part of a large assortment of LEGO Sets for Adults designed for people who enjoy hands-on creative activities to relax," Lego said in its description.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Here we go! üèÜ Launching May 15th üèÅ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LEGOSuperMario?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#LEGOSuperMario</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioKart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarioKart</a> <a href="https://t.co/NZ13sCIFHo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/NZ13sCIFHo</a></p>‚Äî Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1899083988142092785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The tenor of this build certainly seems aimed at the older, "advanced" builder of Lego. It also works with the Lego Builder app, which offers in-app building instructions and tools that let builders zoom and rotate around a 3D image of the model as they build. The final result is a posable, Lego-made Mario in his Kart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lego and Mario have built up a solid relationship over the years, with the collaboration resulting in numerous crossover sets. There's the Lego Super Mario line, which erred more on the side of interactive play and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-super-mario-is-great-once-it-clicks">incorporated some game elements into its set design</a>.</p><div catalogid="c504915f-8be6-46c4-874c-f7103df9f4c4" id="216537"><div id="216537" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Mario Kart ‚Äì Mario &amp; Standard Kart</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, some other options were aimed more at the older crowd who might like to build for relaxation and display over interactivity, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/my-first-adult-lego-purchase-was-this-mario-set-and-i-have-no-regrets">the Pirahna Plant</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-super-mario-world-mario-yoshi">the Lego Super Mario World set featuring Mario and Yoshi</a>. Some offer activities for the kids, while others offer nostalgia and complex builds for the adults.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lego Mario Kart build is up for pre-order now, at a price point of $169.99 / ¬£139.99 / ‚Ç¨169.99. The set will fully launch on May 15, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Mar 10, 2025 2:40 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
