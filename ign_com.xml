But while Rockstar’s hotly anticipated sequel has suffered substantial and damaging leaks in the past, this latest leak is anything but.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eagle-eyed leak hunters uncovered an animation reel uploaded to Vimeo by a developer who has worked on a number of Rockstar games. In it were three snippets of development footage apparently showing GTA 6 (they were indeed labeled as such).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, the video was pulled from Vimeo, but the internet noticed and so the GTA 6 clips are doing the rounds. There are three separate clips, each brief and showing animations on what looks like a test map.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first shows a male character removing and inserting a bike into a rental bicycle rack. We see the word ‘LomBike’ on the frame of the bike, which is probably a parody of real life LimeBike rental bicycles. No big surprise there for GTA 6! And we even saw this bike rental system in an official GTA 6 screenshot released by Rockstar earlier this year.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/01/screenshot-2025-12-01-141025-1764599141785.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">You can see GTA 6's bike rental system in official form in the bottom middle portion of this screenshot, just above the bus. Image credit: Rockstar.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other two, similarly brief clips, show a female character, presumably Lucia, getting out the back of a pickup truck in various stages. Again, nothing to write home about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, these very brief animation clips <em>do</em> hint at what we can expect from GTA 6 when it eventually comes out, but they tell us nothing we didn't already know. Of course you'll be able to rent bikes in GTA 6; it was right there in the screenshot, above. And of course you'll be able to jump off a pick up truck. This is GTA 6 we're talking about!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And let’s remember that when you’re actually playing GTA 6, you'll see these animations in finished form — wonderfully detailed and high quality as you’d expect from Rockstar.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This real leak comes hot on the heels of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/increasingly-convincing-ai-generated-gta-6-gameplay-leaks-are-getting-millions-of-views-on-social-media">viral AI-generated GTA 6 gameplay leak</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-backlash-creator-of-viral-gta-6-gameplay-leak-video-insists-it-was-an-experiment-designed-to-show-how-easy-it-has-become-to-blur-the-line-between-reality-and-ai-generated-content">whose creator claimed was all part of a social experiment</a>.
