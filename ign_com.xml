            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I keep coming back to the same question with Killing Floor 3: where's the rest of it? I comfortably spent the last week teaming up against waves of mutant clone zombies, and mindlessly hacking and slashing through these Zeds was a lot of fun. But more than once, my teammates and I – many of whom enjoyed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/killing-floor-2-review">Killing Floor 2</a>, myself included – found ourselves asking one another, "Is this the final release, or is it just Early Access?" Whether you like to play online or if you just prefer to go it alone, Killing Floor 3's singular Survival mode is generally a good time, but it’s also a much simpler, more tightly-woven shoot-em-up compared to its predecessors. The weapons and classes it does include are at least a blast to use, and its enemies are perfectly balanced; they're dangerous when you let them swarm you, but boy do they die good. But all this fast-paced action loses its luster once you've seen everything it has to offer, which doesn’t take long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Killing Floor 3's moment-to-moment action follows the same formula as the first two games, just streamlined for a snappier, more live service-oriented delivery. That includes quicker movement that feels great immediately, letting you dash from side-to-side, mantle up surfaces, and powerslide from sprint to crouch. You’ll still be slashing and blasting your way through waves of enemies, setting up defenses and earning currency to spend on upgraded weapons, armor, ammo, grenades, self-heal refills, and so on between each assault. There’s no linear campaign to break up that chaos, and a relatively limited selection of options at launch: just six playable classes called Perks, 30 weapons (plus the knife), 13 enemy varieties, eight maps, and three total bosses. That does make this a good entry point for anyone just trying to get into the series compared to the infamously bloated Killing Floor 2, but a tougher sell to series veterans who have come to expect a higher level of complexity and tactical depth.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Killing Floor 3 - Screenshots and Specialists</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, its lone Survival mode stays fun thanks to the off-the-wall combat system. The mode itself is pretty self-explanatory: the only goal is to survive five increasingly deadly waves of Zed and then fight one of the bosses at the end, like the Zerg-like Queen Crawler or the rhinoceros-horned Impaler. According to one of my teammates, who managed to get into a full group with over five players (we only managed to play together in smaller groups of three due to time constraints), these bosses will spawn in clusters as the team fills up – this is meant to keep everything balanced, in theory. You can get pretty creative with how you take them out as Killing Floor 3 hands you an arsenal full of deadly armaments, even down to the basic starting weapons for each class. That could be the Engineer's versatile Krait submachine gun, the Ninja's Kiba and Shuriken combo, or even just the knife that every class gets, which is delightfully overpowered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are always a few other tactical considerations at play too, adding layers of variety to the carnage. For example, timing your special ability – like the Ninja's shocking Hebi-Ken, or the Medic's area-denying and team-healing Sanctum – so that you use it on more powerful opponents like the Scrake or the Siren, or landing enough headshots at the right moment to activate Zed Time, aka sparkling slow-mo, to make wave after wave of these satisfying-to-kill enemies pass by pretty quickly. Class interplay in multiplayer, while still pretty simplistic on paper, can also get interesting when it works well. For instance, the Sharpshooter can turn a group of foes into ice sculptures with her Cryo Grenade, so the Ninja can quickly get in and shatter them with his sword.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The eight maps are decently unique in layout and aesthetic design.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Killing Floor 3's 13 monster types are way more believable-looking and just plain fun to fight, leaving behind puddles of gore and lasting destruction to the environment, and also responding to your attacks in ways that look and feel more realistic thanks to the new and improved physics system. They die quickly enough to make you feel powerful, but the real challenge is in making sure you manage your resources – ammo, health, grenades, trade tools, and your class's special ability – while providing enough of a fight to keep them from overwhelming you in numbers. Acid-spewing Bloats and sonic boom-launching Sirens show up way more often in Killing Floor 3 than I recall them showing up in Killing Floor 2, as do most of the other sub-boss type enemies – including the series-classic Scrakes, which now don cybernetic augmentations, heavy armor, and a fearsome combination of chainsaws and grappling hooks. Just be prepared for a lot of realistic-looking blood effects. More Zed blood flows across your screen in any given frame than water in a typical Final Fantasy X cutscene.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The eight maps you’ll fight them on are also decently unique in layout and aesthetic design, but there's nothing particularly different about each to set them apart. The main differences are in tactical advantages, like Convoy's generous placement of turrets or the height brought by R&amp;D Lab's different floors, where you can use zip lines to quickly get away from enemies in the main atrium but mantling over the guardrails will drop you to your death. Radar Station is my personal favorite, since I like its spooky central Washington backdrop, complete with mist-cloaked forests under a full moon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from Normal difficulty, there are two harder difficulty variants to further test your reflexes across each map, as well as your tactical understanding of class, weapon, and monster mechanics. Plus, there's a pretty cool Weekly Mutation option in the world map menu that throws you into a match with randomized modifiers that work in favor of the Zed swarm. My party and I haven't managed to beat one of these tougher matches yet, so it's safe to say they provide a good challenge. I don't doubt that putting more time into Killing Floor 3, leveling up my characters a bit more, and getting even better with the mechanics will feel rewarding when I'm finally able to beat a boss on the Hell On Earth difficulty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The six classes are distinct enough that playing each one feels like a meaningfully different experience. You've got the versatile small arms-wielding Commando, pyrotechnics-obsessed Firebug, crowd-controlling Sharpshooter, close-quarters combat-focused Ninja, utility and heavy-weapons-savvy Engineer, and a Medic who wields SMGs that shoot healing darts. These classes are pretty standard fare on the surface, and it’s nice that you can mix and match weapons between them, but they all feel unique thanks to meaningful skill progression, as well as their special abilities and unique grenades. Each one also starts with a different trade tools; for instance, the Engineer has the Multi-Tool, which can conveniently activate points of interest around the map, like automated turret installations, armor lockers, and zip line routes. Meanwhile, the Medic starts with a Syringe Bag, which allows players to load up on an extra self-heal syringe mid-battle instead of waiting to buy them at the end of a wave.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Class customization feels deeper, but it comes at the expense of weapon progression.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Tripwire Interactive took the between-match skill-based progression from previous entries and made it way more accessible by having it come into play earlier on – it now starts when you hit level two with a class instead of level five, a la Killing Floor 2, and then rapidly increases in complexity by unlocking new options every two levels instead of every five, up to what appears to be a level cap of 30. Since leveling up is so quick between sessions, it can feel overwhelming (in a good way) to head back to the hub area after a long series of back-to-back attempts to select a ton of new skills for a given character class.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that's all fine, because skills provide modest bumps in tactical performance in various areas, each one pushing your character in the direction of a specific playstyle but never doing so much as to completely redefine a class's appearance or role. For example, the Ninja is a clear predecessor to Killing Floor 2's Berserker, wielding melee weapons like the Kiba, Shurikens, and the dual-Katanas while exploiting enemy movements with shock traps. I've decked out my Ninja to heal himself by landing parries while increasing the damage of his heavy attacks, which incentivises me to stick to his starting Kiba longer, rather than invest in his Bow or Tanto weapons at the Trader between waves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My Sharpshooter is the exact opposite, with skill progression that positions her as a stationary combatant by, for instance, giving her boosts to damage while crouching in place or freezing foes with her Cryo Grenade. This makes her tactically advantageous no matter which weapon she's using, just as long as I keep her far away from the action. This is a great amount of meaningful choice, letting me decide how I want to engage with the carnage ahead of time, without getting lost in the skill menu. My only issue here is a weird bug that caused my UI to completely lock up whenever I hovered above a skill choice for too long, forcing me to completely reboot my game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Class customization feels deeper than before, but it comes at the expense of Killing Floor 3's weapon progression system. My main gripe is that the tier system feels completely backwards. First off, there is both persistent progression and mid-match progression to consider. Persistent progression takes place in the hub area, where you use the Armory system to set up custom loadouts for each main weapon and sidearm for each class, which exist in addition to fully decked-out default weapon loadouts that are immediately accessible mid-match – assuming you earn enough currency in a given match to afford those upgrades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those predetermined weapons scale from grey to purple, but the tier system only seems to make sense when you consider default loadouts. The basic weapons you start with can be permanently upgraded in the Armory to extremely powerful levels, and it only takes a match or two to earn enough crafting resources to do so. The higher-tier weapons do offer a boost against the default loadouts for lower-tier weapons, but my teammates and I kept finding that our upgraded starter weapons consistently outperformed the expensive purple-tier gear we had to save up for. It creates this weird economy where you're better off ignoring half the weapon selection entirely – since, with enough (easily obtainable) crafting materials you can craft every mod for every weapon from the very start – giving you the option to create an OP and relatively inexpensive grey weapon for any class, grab it near the beginning of any session, and stick to just that. This can make each match’s mid-game progression feel dull, since the expensive stuff you're meant to be working toward feels like a downgrade at that point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At least the weapons across each of the four tiers all feel good to use, regardless of raw damage output, adding to each class's style and strategy when wielded with the right skill boosts and player tactics. That could be the Engineer's deadly Ifrit plasma cannon or the Firebug's explosive Dragonbreath shotgun, which is a total blast against bigger foes like the jetpack-wearing Husk or the aforementioned Impaler boss.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The hub genuinely feels like you are a part of Killing Floor 3's world.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I love that the well-designed Stronghold hub area gives you a place to relax between matches and during Killing Floor 3's brief but helpful tutorial. This is the central spot to mess around with class and weapon modifications, try different weapons in the shooting range, play with cosmetics, dig into the Season Pass, and pick your next mission. Standing at the mission terminal and plotting a course from the world map genuinely feels like you're part of Killing Floor 3's world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to Killing Floor 2's Objective Mode, which is absent in the third outing, there are some basic side missions to complete for extra story flavor bits that are built directly into the Survival mode. Those missions have objectives like "scan all the cargo crates at a location on X map," or "kill 10 of X enemy type," or "run 2,000 feet," – you probably get the gist by this point. These reward crafting supplies, Battle Pass points, and experience points that later become useful when unlocking crafted weapon mods, Battle Pass rewards, and class skills in the hub. It's worth noting that you can also get more crafting supplies by taking out random pieces of equipment, like surveillance cameras and vending machines, which is a small but fun touch.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Gabriel's Favorite First-Person Shooters</h3><p>A top 10 list of Gabriel's all-time favorite first-person shooters.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The missions are all easy to complete in large batches during routine gameplay, but they don't do much more than add lore flavor and loot. In fact, Killing Floor 3's story is entirely forgettable. If not for its rather hefty Codex explaining all the important details about these characters, weapons, enemy types, background stories, and so forth, I probably wouldn't even consciously realize there's any semblance of a narrative at all. But I already knew what I was getting myself into, and sometimes, as in the case with a series that's this irreverent, action-packed, and unapologetically gory, less is more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hub is also where you'll encounter the usual live-service stuff that comes with modern multiplayer shooters. Here, you can set up cross-platform multiplayer, which is a welcome inclusion that works well. And then there's the microtransactions store. It seems to have a small revolving selection of cosmetics for now, kinda like what Diablo 4's cosmetic store looked like during that game's launch. I only looked at it once or twice before moving on, so it's safe to call it an afterthought and not essential to gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of live-service checklists, I barely touched the Season Pass or messed with the limited cosmetic customization of my characters – you can only change headgear and armor skins, nothing else. Just expect to spend the equivalent of $4.99 for 500 in-game store points for aesthetics that don't really matter or differentiate your character too much. Are these microtransactions burdensome? Probably not. Marginally annoying? Definitely.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Killing Floor 3 is a polished sequel that feels both smartly streamlined and somewhat hollow. Its co-op shooting feels great, the classes are distinct, and my teammates and I had a good time blasting through Zed hordes together while the fun lasted. But with only eight maps, six classes, and a backwards weapon progression system that’s already in need of some tweaking, this comes across more like a solid Early Access build than a full release. The foundation is there, and if Tripwire keeps adding content like it did with Killing Floor 2, this could become something special. Right now, though, there’s at least enough for a weekend's worth of fun.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/killing-floor-3-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">2025 has not been the best year for Xbox. Microsoft’s recent massive company-wide layoff impacted up to 9,000 employees, nearly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff"><u>half of whom worked at Xbox</u></a>. Multiple games were cancelled, “AAAA” studio The Initiative was shut down, and countless talented staff lost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a strange and uneasy contrast, then, to see that Xbox has actually had a pretty good year when it comes to games. Its biggest first-party releases so far this year have been Obsidian Entertainment’s Avowed, Compulsion Games’ South of Midnight, Bethesda’s Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, and id Software’s Doom: The Dark Ages. The company has also pushed forward its multiplatform plans with a few ports for the PlayStation 5, including the previously Xbox and PC exclusives Forza Horizon 5 and Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That good chain of games looks set to continue as many developers and studios at Xbox continue their hard work. There are numerous video games in development at Xbox across multiple divisions today, from Bethesda, Activision Blizzard, and Xbox Game Studios. To help keep track of them all, we’ve collected everything we know about every Xbox studio and their current projects below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arkane Studios</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Arkane Studios, the developer behind the Dishonored series, was previously spread across two locations: one studio in Austin, Texas, which developed Prey, and another in Lyon, France, which most recently released  Deathloop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On May 7, 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda"><u>Xbox closed Arkane’s Austin branch</u></a> following the tepid release of its horror co-op shooter, Redfall. However, Arkane Lyon remains open and continues work on the studio’s next game, Marvel’s Blade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced at the 2023 Game Awards, Marvel’s Blade is an upcoming action-adventure game starring the iconic vampire hunter who’s on a mission to protect Paris from an oncoming vampire invasion. And in a big departure from the first-person games Arkane is typically known for, Blade will be playable in the third-person perspective. Deathloop director and studio head Dinga Bakaba will co-direct Blade alongside Arkane’s long-serving art director, Sebastien Mitton, and Bakaba has said he’s excited to bring Arkane’s unique take on Blade to life. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Arkane’s financial statements for 2024,<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/timur222.bsky.social/post/3ltlhwfmlac2i" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> Blade entered full production</u></a> at the end of last year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bethesda Game Studios</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, Bethesda Game Studios has one big game on the horizon: The Elder Scrolls 6. The next mainline game in the beloved fantasy RPG series was announced way back in 2018 at a long-forgotten <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/11/e3-2018-the-elder-scrolls-vi-announced-at-bethesda-press-conference"><u>event called E3</u></a>. Crucially, the announcement came simultaneously with the reveal of Starfield, and Bethesda was hard at work creating the space-faring RPG. The developers reiterated to the public many times that The Elder Scrolls 6 would not enter full production until after Starfield was released.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, following the launch of Starfield in 2023 and the expansion DLC Shattered Space in 2024, Bethesda is finally all-in on The Elder Scrolls 6. As part of The Elder Scrolls' 30th anniversary on March 25, 2024, Bethesda announced that the next <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-the-elder-scrolls-turns-30-bethesda-issues-brief-the-elder-scrolls-6-update"><u>Elder Scrolls was fully in development</u></a>, and that there are even early builds of the game up and running.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While The Elder Scrolls 6 is officially Bethesda’s only project, Windows Central’s Jez Corden <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DDr2ZSFIEXk?t=3845s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reports</u></a> that the next Fallout game has also been greenlit. If that’s true, it comes with many questions, including if the new Fallout is being developed by Bethesda Game Studios or handled by another developer, much like how Obsidian Entertainment developed Fallout: New Vegas.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Blizzard Entertainment</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard Entertainment remains focused on three core franchises: Diablo 4, Overwatch 2, and World of Warcraft. Following the cancellation of an unannounced fantasy survival game codenamed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-team-working-on-blizzards-now-canceled-survival-was-seemingly-gutted-amid-xbox-mass-layoffs"><u>Odyssey back in 2024</u></a>, Blizzard has narrowed its focus to concentrate on improving its most popular games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch 2 is still receiving regular updates. After Blizzard cancelled the planned PvE story mode back in 2023, much of the focus has been on improving the PvP competitive modes. Since the launch of Overwatch 2, Blizzard has released an average of three new playable heroes per year. The next hero coming to Overwatch 2 is a new support character named Wuyang, who is scheduled to be released as part of Season 18. And earlier this year, Blizzard released a new competitive multiplayer format called Stadium, where teams of five fight in a best-of-seven series, and in each new round players can purchase new upgrades for their heroes, similar to Riot’s Valorant.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Diablo 4 operates on a seasonal update schedule, with larger DLC expansions that add more significant upgrades and story content. The first expansion, titled Vessel of Hatred, released on October 7, 2024, added a massive new jungle region called Nahantu as well as a new Spiritborn character class that controls the ancient powers of the jungle to wield both long-range and melee abilities. The latest season, Sins of the Horadrim, launched just last month and adds Nightmare Dungeon upgrades and Horadric Spells, among numerous other new additions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for World of Warcraft, Blizzard did something unprecedented at BlizzCon 2023 and announced not one, but three expansions for the popular MMORPG. Starting with The War Within, released on August 26, 2024, Blizzard kicked off the Worldsoul Saga, an overarching story that will unite the three expansions. The next expansions in the  Saga are titled Midnight and The Last Titan, but so far, we don’t know when these entries will launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, Blizzard has committed to supporting World of Warcraft Classic, which recreates World of Warcraft at earlier release states. WoW Classic is currently on Cataclysm Classic, the fourth expansion ever released for WoW.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Compulsion Games</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following We Happy Few in 2018, Canadian-based Compulsion Games released its newest game, South of Midnight, on April 8, 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">South of Midnight is an action-adventure game set in a fantastical version of the Deep South. The game follows a young mystic named Hazel Flood on her journey to become a Weaver, a magical mender of broken spirits. Along the way, Hazel encounters numerous mythical creatures and enemies based on Southern Gothic folklore. IGN gave South of Midnight an 8 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-review"><u>our review</u></a>, calling it “a straightforward but well-executed action-adventure game on the surface, with a simple but satisfying mix of combat and platforming.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s been no word yet on what Compulsion Games is working on next.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Coalition</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox’s dedicated Gears of War studio has quite the busy schedule ahead of it. Canada-based The Coalition is <em>gearing </em>up for the release of Gears of War: Reloaded, a 4K remaster of the original Gears of War game. Reloaded is set to release on Xbox Series X and S, PC, and – for the first time ever – PS5 on August 26, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this is just an appetizer for Gears of War: E-Day, the next mainline Gears of War game set 14 years before the events of the original. Marcus Fenix (John DiMaggio) and Dom Santiago (Carlos Ferro) will return in a prequel that finally tells the full story of Emergence Day,  when monstrous creatures known as the Locust emerged from underground and destroyed the planet Sera. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War: E-Day is currently scheduled to release sometime in 2026.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Double Fine Productions</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Double Fine had been keeping quiet following the release of Psychonauts 2 in 2021, but all that changed when the studio announced its next game, Keeper. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeper was first revealed at this year’s Xbox Summer Game Showcase and will be released on October 17, 2025. Described as a “story told without words,” Keeper is a puzzle adventure game starring a sentient lighthouse and a spirited seabird as they make their way through a magical realm. If you saw the trailer for Keeper and thought it was breathtaking, you should know that Double Fine’s Lee Petty, the art director on Brutal Legend and Broken Age, is the creative lead on Keeper.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Halo Studios</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo Studios, formerly known as 343 Industries, is currently working on multiple new Halo projects, including an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-halo-games-moving-to-unreal-engine-as-developer-343-industries-officially-changes-its-name"><u>unannounced game made in Unreal Engine 5</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite working on perhaps the most significant Xbox series of all, Endgadget <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/even-before-the-xbox-layoffs-there-was-tension-at-halo-studios-002031995.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reported</u></a> that Halo Studios was impacted by the company-wide layoffs at Microsoft and that, behind the scenes, there are tensions over the direction of the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Provided things all remain steady, the current plan is for Halo Studios to reveal its new game at the Halo World Championships in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-teases-more-halo-news-this-october"><u>October 2025</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Id Software</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Texas-based id Software has already released one of IGN’s favorite games of 2025, Doom: The Dark Ages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released on May 15, Doom: The Dark Ages is a heavy metal, dark fantasy prequel to 2016’s Doom. Id Software intentionally went for a slower, tankier approach to combat with The Dark Ages, taking away some of the Doom Slayer’s speed and agility. In exchange, he has access to heavier weapons like a flail and shield he can throw at enemies, a la Captain America. There’s also our new favorite weapon, the skull-crushing Pulverizer, which uses enemy bones as ammo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN gave the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-review"><u>newest Doom game a 9</u></a>, calling it “a new flavor of the legendary shooter series that’s heavier and more grounded, but no less energetic and exhilarating.” If you haven’t played Doom: The Dark Ages yet, it’s worth checking out for sure. Naturally, considering The Dark Ages was only released this year, there’s no word yet on the studio’s next game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Infinity Ward</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision maintains a continuous development cycle to uphold an annual Call of Duty release cadence. That means the franchise’s key studios – Infinity Ward, Treyarch, Raven Software, and Sledgehammer Games – each trade off lead development duties on the newest Call of Duty game. The studios not working on this year’s installment will be working on either next year’s game or the year after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last Call of Duty title Infinity Ward led development on was 2022’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. The studio then assisted Sledgehammer Games on 2023’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and Treyarch with last year’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. This year’s entry, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, is co-developed by Treyarch and Raven Software, meaning the studios will have been lead developers two years in a row. It’s unknown whether Infinity Ward is assisting on Black Ops 7 or working on another Call of Duty project.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Inxile Entertainment</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After being acquired by Xbox in 2018, the RPG specialists at InXile Entertainment are finally getting ready to release their first game under the Xbox Game Studios banner, Clockwork Revolution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first-person RPG is set in a vibrant, steampunk version of the 19th century where crime and violence thrive. Amid an escalating turf war between local gangs, criminal kingpins, and the local government, you gain the ability to manipulate time, which will surely come in handy during the ensuing conflict.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clockwork Revolution was first announced in 2023, and InXile says it’s the studio’s biggest game to date in terms of scope and budget. Based on the most recent gameplay trailer from Xbox’s Summer Games Showcase, it certainly appears to be a deep RPG with multiple dialogue options that affect the outcome of certain situations, a deeply customizable character creator, and numerous weapon modifications. However, Clockwork Revolution still doesn’t have a firm release window.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">King</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sweden-based mobile game developer King remains in charge of one of the most successful mobile games of all time, Candy Crush. While King has taken brief detours away from the series, working on mobile games like 2021’s Crash Bandicoot: On the Run and 2020’s Knighthood, King continues to release new Candy Crush games, most recently Candy Crush Solitaire in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite its flagship series’ continued success, King was affected by the Microsoft layoffs, with 10% of its total workforce cut.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MachineGames</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Swedish developer MachineGames blew everyone away with its stellar reboot of Wolfenstein back in 2014, and most recently surprised everyone with the announcement that it was making a new Indiana Jones video game – a totally different style of experience, aside from all the Nazis, of course.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starring the famous archaeologist in a new, globe-trotting adventure, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was critically acclaimed thanks to its fantastic mix of first- and third-person gameplay, an uncanny performance by Troy Baker that sounds almost exactly like Harisson Ford circa-1980, and ultimately its ability to capture the exact tone of the better Indiana Jones movies in video game form. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">MachineGames is following up its hit release with the first story DLC, The Order of Giants, which was announced at this year's Xbox Summer Games Showcase and will be released on September 4, 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mojang Studios</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sweden-based studio behind Minecraft continues to release regular updates for its massively popular crafting game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most recent update for Minecraft, titled “Chase the Skies,” was released on June 17, 2025, and adds 60+ biomes, new buildable structures, and the ability to explore the overworld from the skies with a new mount called Happy Ghast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition, Mojang produced a live-action Minecraft film, which was released earlier this year. Starring Jack Black and Jason Mamoa, A Minecraft Movie is currently the third-highest-grossing film of 2025 and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-blows-past-700-million-at-the-box-office-in-its-quest-to-be-the-highest-grossing-video-game-film-ever"><u>second-highest-grossing video game film of all time</u></a> after 2023’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ninja Theory</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">UK-based Ninja Theory released Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 on May 21, 2024, the long-awaited sequel to 2017’s Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice. With Senua’s story wrapped up, Ninja Theory could be shifting focus to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-theorys-project-mara-is-set-in-a-single-incredibly-realistic-apartment"><u>Project: Mara</u></a>, a horror game the studio first teased back in January 2020. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Ninja Theory hasn’t shared too much information about the upcoming horror game, the studio explained in a video diary that Project: Mara will be a “real-world and grounded representation of mental terror.” This is an area that’s of great interest to Ninja Theory, as both Hellblade and Senua’s Saga also examined mental health in great detail by combining binaural audio effects for the psychosis-inflicted voices in Senua’s head with actress Melina Juergens’ powerful performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/making-video-games-is-difficult-ninja-theory-studio-head-talks-at-the-fore-of-senuas-saga-hellblade-2s-xbox-and-pc-launch" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Windows Central</u></a> reports that Xbox has greenlit another game from Ninja Theory alongside Project: Mara, but nothing else is known about that game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Obsidian Entertainment</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian Entertainment is having itself a very busy 2025. Earlier this year, the studio released Avowed, a fantasy RPG set in the Pillars of Eternity universe. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-review"><u>IGN’s review</u></a>, we gave Avowed a 7, calling it a reminder of why we fell in love with Obsidian’s RPG but ultimately a game that plays it “quite safe” overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Up next is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grounded-2-first-hands-on-preview-bigger-than-before"><u>Grounded 2</u></a>, a sequel to the 2022 online co-op game about a group of kids who are shrunk down to miniature size by a science experiment gone wrong and must survive the dangers of their suburban backyard. Grounded 2 will hit Early Access on July 29, 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the biggest game on Obsidian’s calendar is The Outer Worlds 2. The first Outer Worlds game was a sci-fi RPG co-directed by Leonard Boyarsky and Tim Cain, the creators of the original Fallout series, and shares much of Fallout’s morbid humor and world-building sensibilities. The Outer Worlds depicts a retro-futuristic version of outer space that’s been poisoned by unchecked capitalism. All that may sound a little too much like VaultTech, but it’s certainly got its own distinct flavour. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first Outer Worlds became a sleeper hit, selling over four million units and receiving numerous Game of the Year award nominations, and the sequel looks to expand on that success. Based on our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-the-first-preview-ign-first"><u>IGN First previews</u></a>, The Outer Worlds 2 maintains the irreverent tone of the original game, while greatly expanding upon the game’s combat and exploration. It’s set to release on October 29, 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Playground Games</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The UK-based Playground Games is best known for its work on Forza Horizon, an open-world arcade racer spinoff of Xbox’s more serious racing-sim, Forza Motorsport. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, in 2020, Playground Games was officially announced as the developer behind the upcoming Fable reboot. In the years since, we’ve sadly learned very little about it, despite a handful of trailers showcasing the comedic tone, semi-realistic art style, pre-alpha gameplay, and celebrity cameos from famous UK comedians like Matt King and Richard Ayoade. Originally planned to launch this year, Fable was recently delayed into a 2026 release window. We hope to see much more of the game in the coming months.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rare</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rare was deeply impacted by the recent company-wide layoffs at Microsoft. The famed developer behind games like Goldeneye 007 and Banjo-Kazooie has spent the better part of the past decade releasing regular updates for its popular online pirate game, Sea of Thieves. However, Rare was also working on Everwild, a third-person fantasy adventure game that was first announced in 2019. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At some point in 2021, it was reported that Everwild was experiencing development difficulties and underwent a complete reboot. However, following the layoffs at Microsoft, Xbox announced internally that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox"><u>Everwild would be canceled</u></a>. In addition, longtime Rare director Gregg Mayles, who had reportedly been lead on Everwild following its reboot, resigned from the studio he first joined in 1989.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While work on Sea of Thieves will likely continue, it’s unclear what the next steps are for the venerable British studio.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Raven Software</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Raven Software is part of Activision’s stable of dedicated Call of Duty developers and is the co-developer of the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which it is working on alongside Treyarch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two studios previously led development on 2024’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, with Raven developing the single-player campaign. In our review, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review"><u>IGN gave Black Ops 6 a 9</u></a>, calling it “the best Call of Duty campaign in many, many years.” Will Raven and Treyarch be able to follow up on their prior game’s success when Black Ops 7 is released later in 2025? We’re excited to find out.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Sledgehammer Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">California-based Sledgehammer Games is another Call of Duty studio working under the Activision umbrella. It previously led development on 2023’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and before it, Call of Duty: Vanguard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Sledgehammer was listed as an assist studio on 2024’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, it was also reported that the studio<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-at-toys-for-bob-and-sledgehammer-games-affect-between-30-and-40-of-staff-insider-says" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> lost 30% of its staff </u></a>in a round of layoffs back in 2024, and it’s unknown whether Sledgehammer will be able to lead development on a new Call of Duty game going forward.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Treyarch</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Raven Software, Treyarch is the co-developer of the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As one of the longest-running developers at Activision, Treyarch has worked on Call of Duty games since as early as 2005’s Call of Duty 2: Big Red One. Treyarch is responsible for founding the very popular Black Ops sub-series, and is also responsible for developing Call of Duty’s Zombies – most recently for 2021’s Vanguard, 2023’s Modern Warfare 3, and last year’s Black Ops 6. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Turn 10 Studios</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Washington-based Turn 10 Studios was once the home of Xbox’s racing sim Forza Motorsport, but all that appears to have changed following the recent layoffs at Microsoft. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg’s Jason Schrier</u></a>, Turn10 reportedly lost nearly 50% of its staff in this year’s layoffs, and the studio is effectively “shuttered.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Further reports suggest that the Forza Motorsport series will no longer be supported, and remaining Turn 10 staff will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-motorsport-team-is-no-more-former-developer-claims-with-remaining-turn-10-staff-left-to-support-the-horizon-side"><u>serve as an assist team</u></a> on the spinoff series, Forza Horizon.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Undead Labs</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Seattle-based studio Undead Labs has been working on State of Decay 3 for the past several years. The third game in the popular zombie survival sim series, it was officially announced in 2020. However, there have been multiple reports of behind-the-scenes trouble at the studio leading to its slow development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, studio founder Jeff Strain left Undead Labs in 2021 to start up a new studio, Possibility Space (which faced its <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/possibility-space-shuts-down" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>own internal struggles</u></a>). This was followed by a 2022 investigation by <a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-decay-3-xbox-series-x-s-sexism-microsoft-undea-1848728682" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kotaku</u></a> into a toxic work environment at the studio, which resulted in an internal Microsoft investigation and the departure of studio HR boss, Anne Schlosser. These issues have reportedly contributed to the delay of State of Decay 3, which still doesn’t have a release window.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">World’s Edge</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">World’s Edge was established by Xbox Game Studios in 2019 to be the stewards of the Age of Empires real-time strategy series. Since its inception, World’s Edge has released a number of remasters, starting with Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition in 2019, and the most recent being Age of Mythology: Retold. A remaster of the original Age of Mythology, it focuses on ancient civilizations and the gods they worshipped. It was released on September 4, 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">World’s Edge isn’t solely dedicated to remasters, though; it also released a new entry into the series, Age of Empires 4, back in 2021 to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/age-of-empires-4-review"><u>positive reviews</u></a>. It’s unclear if its next step will be to continue working on its remasters (AoE2: Definitive Edition continues to receive expansion packs) or develop an entirely new project. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">ZeniMax Online Studios</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Maryland-based ZeniMax Online Studios has been releasing continuous updates to The Elder Scrolls Online since the game’s launch in 2014. The MMORPG spinoff of Bethesda’s popular Elder Scrolls RPG series has quietly grown to become one of the biggest MMOs in the world, alongside games like World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Behind the scenes, it was reported that ZeniMax Online Studios was also impacted by the recent Microsoft layoffs. Not only has veteran studio boss Matt Firor stepped down from the company, but an unannounced game known only as Project Blackbird was also canceled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Bloomberg reported that Xbox executives were<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-03/microsoft-s-xbox-cancels-blackbird-an-upcoming-game-that-impressed-executives" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> “blown away”</u></a> by Project Blackbird, Xbox still announced internally that it was cancelling the game. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-unannounced-mmo-was-doing-well-and-even-scaling-up-as-xbox-cancelation-blindsided-staff-sources-say"><u>Reports</u></a> have since come out with more details about Project Blackbird. The game was set to be a new sci-fi MMO where players would navigate the politics of warring gangster factions on an alien planet where one side of the planet is engulfed in fire and the other covered in ice. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">ZeniMax Online Studios was reportedly staffing up to begin full production on Project Blackbird before it was canceled. And while work will continue on The Elder Scrolls Online, developers have shared online how devastating the news of Project Blackbird’s cancellation has been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fallout of the Microsoft layoffs is still being felt throughout the industry and will likely shape Xbox as it heads into the next generation. Not only have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/canceled-video-games-2025">games been canceled</a>, but entire studios, like The Initiative, have been shut down, and games like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">Perfect Dark reboot have gone with them</a>. While there are still Xbox games to look forward to on the horizon, the future of Xbox remains an open question.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-the-state-of-every-first-party-developer-summer-2025-update]]></content:encoded>
