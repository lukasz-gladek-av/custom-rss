As a first-party Microsoft game, Avowed launches day one on Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the Battle.net launch that’s of most interest here, because it means you’ll be able to buy the game with World of Warcraft gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s how it works: WoW Tokens can be exchanged for Battle.net Balance, not just game time, which means players can indirectly buy anything Blizzard sells for real-world money with in-game gold. Players can buy a WoW Token from Blizzard for $20 and either keep it for later or put it on the in-game auction house. Another player will (hopefully) buy that token from the auction house for in-game gold, then exchange it for $15 of Battle.net Balance (Blizzard effectively takes a $5 tax from the transaction). Battle.net Balance can then be used to buy anything Blizzard sells for World of Warcraft for real-world money, including video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of this article’s publication, a WoW Token is going for 262,365 gold (the price fluctuates as demand rises and falls). At its cheapest, Avowed costs $69.99, which means you’ll need five WoW Tokens to exchange for enough Battle.net Balance to buy the game. That equates to 1.3 million gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a lot of gold most players probably don’t have lying around. But with Avowed three months from launch, there is time to get that WoW gold grind going, if you’re determined to buy the game without actually buying the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, it’s worth noting that Microsoft is selling up to five days of early access to Avowed via the Premium Edition, which costs $89.99 and also includes two premium skin packs and access to the digital artbook and soundtrack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/surprise-nintendo-tracked-down-alleged-switch-pirate-in-arizona-via-reddit-posts-and-repair-orders<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo tracked down an alleged Switch pirate using a combination of Reddit posts and repair orders, a new lawsuit has revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/how-nintendo-found-archbox-switch" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game File</a>, Nintendo sued James “Archbox” Williams, from Surprise, Arizona, for allegedly violating its digital copyrights by selling pirated copies of Switch games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the lawsuit, Nintendo hired a law firm called Mitchell Silberberg &amp; Knupp to investigate online pirate video game stores and found a user called Archbox it traced to Arizona. It then spotted a Reddit user called Archbox (Archbox was a moderator of r/SwitchPirates). Based on their posts, the law firm was able to identify Archbox as James Williams. Williams, it turns out, had various Nintendo accounts associated with email addresses, which were tied to repair orders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Williams, an alleged Switch pirate, actually made two repair orders with Nintendo tied to a Surprise, Arizona shipping address.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, cease-and-desists followed — one of which came just two days after Nintendo sent him one of his repaired items. The pirate shops Archbox was allegedly involved with include Jack-in-the-Shop, Turtle in the Shop, and NekoDrive, which all shut down following a cease-and-desist Nintendo sent in March.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Defendant became a leading (if not the primary) moderator of the SwitchPirates Reddit community, which he helped grow to nearly 190,000 members," Nintendo’s initial complaint reads, as reported by <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-modded-hardware-and-r-switchpirates-moderator-archbox-240701/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Torrent Freak</a>. "Since 2019, Defendant has posted thousands of comments and messages to the SwitchPirates Reddit Group.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Defendant’s posts have included, by way of example, messages directing users to the Pirate Shops […]; and offering technical advice and encouragement to other users about how to use the Pirate Shops, how to download and install Circumvention Software, and how to play pirated copies of Nintendo Switch games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo now has a default judgment in their favor after Williams failed to plead his case to the court in time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The idea Microsoft is trying to get across, which is in keeping with its previous messaging, is that Xbox is less about consoles these days and more about being able to play on any device capable of playing a video game. So, in this sense, a TV is an Xbox, a phone is an Xbox, etc.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/15/tiaxb-16x9-asset-r1-1-0f22101df1dfc3cb6000-1731666374471.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Microsoft's new 'This is an Xbox' advertising campaign is already a meme. Image credit: Microsoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That hasn’t gone down well with core Xbox fans already dissatisfied with Microsoft’s gaming strategy in recent years. Not only have they seen the Xbox console fade from importance as sales of the Xbox Series X and S collapse, but the Xbox console exclusive become extinct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, Xbox CEO Phil Spencer discussed the future of the Xbox brand as well as the advertising campaign. “It’s an interesting topic because as we look at the brand, as we’re changing the brand, [it] means something different,” Spencer said. “It literally was a box when it first launched. It was the Direct X box. What it’s grown into now is more accessibility. Xbox isn’t just one device, Xbox is on your smart TV, Xbox is on your PC, Xbox is on your phone, and we’re in the middle of that transition.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Rolling Stone, Spencer acknowledged that some fans would be turned off by the campaign. Some people “long for the simplicity of a single box, single platform, single game,” he said, before insisting “today’s largest games are bigger than any of the individual platforms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a nod to the likes of Fortnite and Roblox, which have become enormous platforms with monthly player counts comparable to the likes of Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo consoles. For Spencer, then, the focus is on the games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the thing that should really have longevity are the games, characters and world — and the platforms should enable us to experience those games where we want to play,” he said. “That’s how we think about Xbox today.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Microsoft.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
