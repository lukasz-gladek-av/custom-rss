            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Surprise! <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/highguard"><u>Highguard</u></a> has another "heaping pile of fresh, free content" for you, including a new warden, map, a ranked mode, mount, and a variety of QoL tweaks, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new free-to-play PvP raid shooter hailing from some of the creators of Respawn's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/apex-legends"><u>Apex Legends</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/titanfall"><u>Titanfall</u></a> only released a couple of weeks ago, but that hasn't stopped developer Wildlight from dropping a second "major update" in as many weeks, this time introducing Episode 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New warden Ekon is described as a legendary monster-slayer who shapeshifts into a powerful direwolf to track and hunt his prey. The last of a long line of ancient magic wielders known as the Wildwalkers, once thought extinct, Ekon jumps into action when his mentor, and closest thing to family, goes missing in the lost land of Highguard.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">His passive ability, Dread, reveals the heartbeat of wounded enemies, and their heartbeats will continue to be visible until they are dead or regen their health. His tactical, Wolf Spirit, lets you hunt the nearest enemy and apply Dread — even across long distances and through walls and rocks — and ultimate ability Wolf Form sees him turn into a powerful direwolf that can track and hunt mounted enemies. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the new map Skydrift? Coming to the 3v3 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/just-4-days-after-launch-highguard-gets-5v5-limited-time-game-mode-to-counter-those-3v3-complaints"><u>now permanent 5v5 rotation</u></a>, wardens can navigate through hollowed-out caverns once home to great winged-beasts, spar off against one another in an ancient ring of stone, and ride across huge chain bridges and through "remarkable Sky Jumpers to reach Skydrifts highest point — a palace above the clouds." The full notes are included below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Highguard Episode 2 Patch Notes — Out February 6</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">A NEW WARDEN ARRIVES — EKON</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A legendary monster-slayer who shapeshifts into a powerful direwolf to track and hunt his prey. Ekon is the last of a long line of ancient magic wielders known as the Wildwalkers, once thought extinct. When his mentor, and closest thing to family, goes missing in the lost land of Highguard, there is no monster or warden this great predator will allow to stand in his way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dread (Passive)</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reveal the heartbeat of wounded enemies. Once an enemy Warden is low health, they are highlighted in pulsing beats until they are dead, or their health regenerates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wolf Spirit (Tactical)</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unleash a spirit wolf to hunt the nearest enemy and apply Dread. This Wolf Spirit travels long distances, moving straight through rocks and structures to find its prey. If seen in time, it can be shot down. This ability can be cast in human form, or in Wolf form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fearsome Howl (Ultimate)</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apply Dread to all enemies across the map and increase your movement speed. This ability can be cast in human form, or in Wolf form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wolf Form</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ekon doesn’t ride an animal into battle, he becomes one — transforming into a powerful direwolf that tracks, hunts, and runs down mounted enemies. While in this form, Ekon’s speed is unmatched by other mounts. Through a full third-person point of view, the direwolf can see around cover. When moving in for an attack, weapons are laid down in favor of Ekon’s deadly bite attack, which will dash forward and bite a prey before immediately transforming back to human form to finish off the job. Attacking without a target will allow Ekon to perform a small air dash to traverse maps more athletically. In addition, while in Wolf Form, Ekon can track an enemy’s scent that they leave in their path. Ekon can use all of his other powers while in Wolf Form.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">A NEW LOCATION IS DISCOVERED — SKYDRIFT</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Far west of Headwall, beyond the vast, uncharted lands of Highguard where the maps go blank and expeditions go missing lies the fabled lost city of Skydrift recently awakened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wardens can navigate through hollowed out caverns once home to great winged-beasts, spar off against one another in an ancient ring of stone, and ride across colossal chain bridges and through remarkable Sky Jumpers to reach Skydrifts highest point - a palace above the clouds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skydrift is added to the map rotation in 3v3 and 5v5.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">THE STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER — RANKED MODE</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gain Ranked Points (RP), earn point modifiers and climb the ranks to claim your rewards. Go from Bronze (Hare) to Grandmaster (Leviathan) if you’ve got what it takes! Visit the Headwall menu in game to see more information.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ranked Structure</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>The format for Ranked is 3v3</li><li>We believe 3v3 is the more tactical structure of the game and fits best for comp. We will monitor feedback as we get it.</li><li>Each episode will have 2 Ranked Splits. Splits will change the map and base list, and introduce some balance changes.</li><li>All players start Ranked for the first time in Bronze 3.</li><li>Each Rank has 3 Divisions.</li><li>There are 7 Ranks</li><li>Bronze (Hare)</li><li>Silver (Goat)</li><li>Gold (Ape)</li><li>Platinum (Dire Wolf)</li><li>Diamond (Gryphon)</li><li>Master (Manticore)</li><li>Grandmaster (Leviathan)</li><li>At the end of each Episode, you will be rewarded based on the Rank you achieved at the end of the Episode.</li><li>De-Ranking: You can only de-rank inside a Division during a Split. For example, by losing matches you can de-rank from Gold 2 into Gold 3, but you cannot de-rank from Gold 3 into Silver 1.</li><li>At the start of every Split, you will not de-rank at all. At the start of every Episode, you will move backwards 6 Divisions (2 full Ranks)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fairness</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Play with teammates up to 2 tiers difference</li><li>A two person party must be within +/- 1 tier of each other</li><li>A full party of 3 can mix any ranks and be able to play. You will queue into the Rank of the top Ranked player.</li><li>Solo Bonus: If you’re playing without a party, you’ll earn the Solo modifier (details below). You’ll gain more points and lose less per match.</li><li>Loss Protection: You accrue loss protection for playing matches all the way through. It will get automatically spent to stop you from losing RP.</li><li>Early Leaver Penalty is more severe in Ranked. Leaving early counts as 2 strikes and resets your Loss Protection.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Scoring System</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We think if you win big, you should score big.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Victory has 3 versions, before the modifiers are applied.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Overwhelming Victory: 25 RP</li><li>This is winning with 100% base health remaining</li><li>Victory: 20 RP</li><li>This is standard victory where each team was more evenly matched</li><li>Close Victory: 15 RP</li><li>This is winning where your base had 35% base health or less remaining</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">For defeat:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Defeat: -25 RP</li><li>If you lost without doing damage to the enemy team.</li><li>Strong Defense: -20 RP</li><li>If you lost, but had done some damage to the enemy team.</li><li>Close Defeat: -15 RP</li><li>If you lost, but had done at least 65% damage to the enemy team.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Other modifiers:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Winning Streak Bonus: adds 3 RP for each win in a row, up to 6 extra points per game.</li><li>Kill Bonus: Earn extra RP for kills, up to a cap of 5 points per game.</li><li>Solo Bonus: Always earn an extra 4 points if queuing up solo.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Imbalance Protection</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>If a game is deemed imbalance by player ranks:</li><li>The favored team will have less points to win and more points to lose</li><li>The weaker team will have increased points to win, and less points to lose</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Requirements</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>In order to unlock Ranked Mode, you must Win 10 matches of 3v3 Raid Mode.</li><li>This is retroactive. If you’ve already won 10 matches in Episode 1, Ranked Mode will be unlocked immediately.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Maps</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Ranked Mode playlist will have a subset of maps and bases per Split.</li><li>We will change the list every split to keep the rotation interesting, but allow time to build consistent strategies.</li><li>The first Split will have maps Kingdom, Summit and Rivermark, and bases Hellmouth, Smuggler’s Den, King’s Lair, Soul Well, Frosthold and Wellspring.</li><li>As more bases get added to the game, we think having a total of 6 bases in Ranked allows players to master certain bases and build competitive strategies over a Split, but still need to master more than 1 base because your first pick won’t always be available.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Rewards</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Episodic Reward: Ranked players will earn a brand new cosmetic item called Banner Frames.</li><li>You will be awarded the Frame that matches the Rank you achieved in the Episode.</li><li>Frames grow in prestige at higher Ranks!</li><li>Every Episode will earn a new themed Banner Frame. This Episode’s theme is Ekon and the Wolf and will be awarded at the start of Episode 3.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">A NEW BEAST HAS BEEN TAMED — WOLF MOUNT</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">WOLF</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Loyal pack hunter of the wild. The new wolf mount is free to all players.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Try Ranked Challenge: Play 10 matches of Ranked to earn the Shadow Wolf skin.</li></ul><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/c6a8ae1785573990d2bbdeb0f141fc7c431006a8-1770382953019.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">GEAR UP PHASE UPDATES</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One consistent point of feedback we’ve heard is that the Gear Phase needs improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re tackling that in 4 ways for the launch of Episode 2, and we’ll continue to work on that phase in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Better POI Loot</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Weapon Chests in POIs now contain Masterwork weapons.Masterwork weapons have improved stats within their rarity. Blue Masterworks are better than Blues, but still less quality than Purple. Players can still loot upgraded weapons outside of POIs, but the Masterwork versions of weapons each round are only found in POIs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ultimate Chargers</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">These items are found in white barrels in POIs, but we’ve seen that players are having a hard time identifying that. In order to make that clear, white barrels that contain Ultimate Chargers now have an obvious gold glow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Waypoint Markers</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you leave your base in the gear phase, waypoint icons will guide players towards the Points of Interest. They’re also pingable so players can communicate intent without voice comms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The map will also communicate that POIs contain Masterwork Weapons and Ultimate Chargers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Speed Gates</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speed Gates are always on when a player is near them, instead of only when a Shieldbreaker is present. This should allow players to get back to fights after respawning,</p><h2 data-cy="title2">QUALITY OF LIFE &amp; NEW FEATURES</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As we continue to improve the game through feedback, bug fixing and small features, we will document them here. When necessary, we’ll use “dev notes” to give context on why we made a specific change.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Stats 1.0</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players want stats! For Episode 2 we have added a Stats menu to Headwall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The stats tracked here are mostly retroactive from Episode 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raid Attack and Defense success stats are new for Episode 2, as we are just now starting to track these stats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We will continue to expand this feature in future episodes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Orange Weapon Mods:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We will continue to mix up orange weapon mods. For Episode 2, we are adding variety and not removing anything.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Saber Rifle - Impact Rounds</li><li>Increased critical damage (headshots) with a slower rate of fire. Fires a two shot burst instead of three. Faster projectile speed.</li><li>Vanguard - Drum Magazine</li><li>Much larger magazine, with a slower reload.</li><li>Corsair - Doubleshot</li><li>Fire a 12 round burst on each trigger pull</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Technical Updates</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>From the last patch, performance optimizations were applied to player replication, movement netcode, and siege tower rendering.</li><li>Users can now enable NVIDIA Reflex on supported systems.</li><li>Several optimizations were added to reduce bandwidth utilization.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gameplay Updates:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Defensive Phase at the start of the game has been reduced to 30 seconds from 60.</li><li>Anchor Stones fuse timers have been increased to 80 seconds from 60.</li><li>Dev note: The goal here is to make Anchor Stones a bit harder to win on</li><li>We’ve added your Kills and Assists to the HUD above the minimap.</li><li>Many zipline usability improvements, including smoother attaching and riding, and making it harder to accidentally attach</li><li>Players can now have a maximum of 4 ziplines. When casting the 5th, their first one will automatically destroy</li><li>Improvements to mantle feel</li><li>You will be prompted to drop the BigRig when it gets to low or zero ammo</li><li>Upon being revived, you now get a hint to tap the emote button to say "Thank You". As a byproduct your character will no longer automatically say thank you.</li><li>Pinged orange weapons will now show the perk when you hover on them</li><li>You can now ping ziplines</li><li>You can now ping Mara darkspawn when it’s highlighted through walls (at the end of a raid)</li><li>You can now ping Kai’s ice wall</li><li>Pinging a Shieldbreaker or Domesplitter plant point now has more specific ping VO based on the scenario.</li><li>The end game podium will now highlight people who had the highest stats on their team</li><li>Smugglers Den minimap has been updated to be more accurate</li><li>Adjusted the final Shieldbreaker plant animation to take exactly as long as a normal one</li><li>The Trader menu will darken and update if his stock changes while you have the menu open</li><li>Dev note: This is to reduce accidentally purchasing something right as the stock is upgrading.</li><li>Dead players no longer show up on the minimap</li><li>Dev note: This seemed confusing and redundant with being able to see a player's orb through walls.</li><li>Adjusted Mara’s Soul Armor power description to include that it also works on enemy players (so be careful where you throw it)</li><li>Added key bindings on PC for Map Screen, Character Info and Loadout</li><li>AFK timer in a match has been reduced from 5 minutes to 4</li><li>Firing Range targets have been replaced with new versions that stay open so you can test sustained fire</li><li>Firing Range can now accommodate parties of up to 5 players</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Lobby/Menu Updates:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added an option to leave the party by clicking on party member’s social card</li><li>You now get a message confirming that you sent a Friend Request</li><li>Slider bars in the settings menu can now be adjusted by typing in numbers</li><li>Changing your controller profile will now highlight what buttons are changing</li><li>You can now unblock players in your Social tab</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Weapon Updates:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vanguard</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Slightly slowing rate of fire and raising damage. TTK is nearly equivalent. This just reduces the number of bullets required to kill</li><li>Increased headshot multiplier</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Longhorn</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Repeater - Less vertical kick, faster raise time, faster sprint raise time, less spread (hipfire), slower spread bloom (hipfire)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Viper - Impact Rounds</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Smaller mag size</li><li>More kick</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Item Updates:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Amulet: Bomb Kit</li><li>Bomb plant time nerfed (2.5s -&gt; 3s). Defuse time is still 2.5s.</li><li>Amulet: Harvester no longer drops bonus Ultimate Chargers from White Supply Barrels.</li><li>Slightly lowered the top speed of orange Saddles.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Character Updates:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Slade</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed a bug where the impact damage from his Ultimate was not dealing damage on uneven terrain.</li><li>Adding friend/foe identification to Slade’s VFXs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund says the success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a> has given the team “stability [and] long-term security” as it continues to support its new extraction shooter through 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio head opened up about how the developer has changed for the better as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve">a recent interview with IGN</a>. During our chat, we learned more about how the surprise hit video game, which has sold over 12 million copies since going on sale in October, has impacted its team and how it will continue to affect them in the months ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Söderlund acknowledged the “unfortunate” reality that mass layoffs have rocked the video game industry for the last two years. It’s marked a period of uncertainty for developers of every shape and size, but for Embark, Arc Raiders’ popularity among gamers across PC and consoles means safety – and even room for growth – for at least a while.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can live for a long time on the money that Arc Raiders has been generating, and that does give financial security and employment stability for the people that work there,” he said. “We're growing our studio, we're hiring people, we want to build more of Arc Raiders, we want to build more of The Finals.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S priced $40 on October 30, 2025, and follows the team’s 2023 multiplayer shooter, The Finals. At <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-keeps-on-going-as-it-tops-124-million-copies-sold-gifts-all-players-a-gilded-pickaxe"><u>12.4 million copies sold as of January 13</u></a> and an all-time concurrent player peak of 481,996 on Steam (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB</u></a>), the success of Arc Raiders should also help Embark as it continues work on two new, unannounced games. What those look like or when they will release remains unclear for now, but Söderlund and the rest of the team show no signs of slowing down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For us, it's a sigh of relief, obviously for any developer, and we're incredibly happy for that and thankful for everyone that's been supporting us by buying the game,” he added. “It feels great. Obviously, hopefully, we can have competitive salaries, good bonuses for the people that have done all this hard work and deserve to be taken care of adequately.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/gettyimages-970613588-1770382431157.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Patrick Söderlund says the huge success of Arc Raiders changes the game for Embark.

Meanwhile, industry analyst <a href="https://youtu.be/58P5sZJ3Vho?si=RxoryJwAVJ0V5vt8&amp;t=677" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Michael Pachter recently claimed</u></a> the project was made on a $75 million budget (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-budget-was-75-million-its-claimed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Insider Gaming</u></a>). Söderlund wasn’t willing to talk specifics but told us that number is “not too far off.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders is currently in the “Shrouded Sky” portion of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026"><u>its early 2026 roadmap</u></a>, with Embark telling fans to expect a new map condition, new Arc threat, new Raider Deck, and more.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/making-hbo-baldurs-gate-3-tv-series-without-larians-help-would-be-a-big-mistake</link>
            <guid>1428040</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">It was recently revealed that a live-action adaptation of Larian’s award-winning RPG, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-tv-series-set-for-hbo-will-be-a-continuation-of-baldurs-gate-3s-story"><u>Baldur’s Gate 3, is on the way from prestige TV makers HBO</u></a>. It somewhat makes sense at first glance — you can see the Game of Thrones of it all weaving into Baldur’s Gate’s DNA, which itself isn’t shy of a fair helping of shedding both blood and clothes. But look a little closer, and the worries begin. Not necessarily when considering Craig Mazin’s involvement (we’ll get to that later) but when noticing that, apparently, Larian will play no significant role in the show’s development. A decision I can’t help but feel would be a big mistake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get into why Larian is so essential to a show that dares to continue the story of Baldur’s Gate 3, it’s important to establish that the Belgian video game studio does not own the rights to the game’s universe, characters, or storylines. Baldur’s Gate 3 is set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and so is the intellectual property of Wizards of the Coast, the Hasbro-owned tabletop RPG company. Larian’s partnership with Hasbro is over, and so Wizards can do whatever it wants with the likes of Shadowheart, Astarion, Gale, and company – whether that’s another game or, in this case, a TV show. Larian has no legal right to be involved. But that’s not to say its involvement doesn’t make sense, both in terms of simple respect for the studio’s work, and making the most of its unrivalled, extensive knowledge of Baldur’s Gate 3.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the show’s announcement, Larian’s director of publishing, Michael Douse, posted his thoughts on X. “I've spent the last 8 to 10 years of my life with the writers &amp; creators of Baldur's Gate 3, and they're the most incredible storytellers &amp; creators in the space,” he said. “Only hope is that they get both the credit deserved &amp; the characters are represented at the same level as the game”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, fans immediately took to social media to question members of Larian about the project. When asked if any of the game’s writers l would be involved in the show, Baldur’s Gate 3’s director and CEO of Larian Studios, Swen Vincke, confirmed that they’re not. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Not to my knowledge. But Craig did reach out to ask if he could come over to the studio to speak with us. From the conversation we had, I think he truely is a big fan which gives me hope.</p>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019648134645957061?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 6, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Not to my knowledge,” he said. “But Craig [Mazin] did reach out to ask if he could come over to the studio to speak with us. From the conversation we had, I think he truely [sic] is a big fan which gives me hope”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it seems no one from Larian, at least at this stage, will be involved in the production process, it is encouraging to see that Mazin will consult with the studio. But is this really enough? This is a studio that reignited a world, turned a cult-classic CRPG series into one of gaming’s great phenomena, and I can’t help but feel that a little more than a handful of studio visits may be required for the show to make anywhere near as big a footprint on our culture. We do know that, according to the original report on the show’s announcement by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Deadline</u></a>, Mazin wants to reach out to the game’s beloved cast to sound out how best to approach their roles in the TV show, and if they'd want to be involved. This is another smart step towards recapturing the magic of the game, but it will be interesting to see how those actors react to being asked to speak someone else’s words – and their feelings on the very real potential of their starring roles being given to more prolific TV and film actors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I genuinely don't think anyone can trump our writers”, Douse goes on to add. It’s a sentiment I agree with; no one knows those characters or that particular corner of Wizards of the Coast’s world quite like the narrative team at Larian. But, I also don’t think the game’s writers absolutely have to be part of the show’s writers room — crafting stories for video games and television are completely different arts, after all. I do, however, think that the show could do with a steady hand with first-hand experience of the tales Larian told to help steer the ship.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t to say I have no faith in Craig Mazin. Chernobyl is one of the finest pieces of television this century, and his contribution to HBO’s interpretation of The Last of Us was certainly successful in its first season, even if the jury is definitely still out on its much more divisive season two and whatever becomes of its next chapter. But the adaptation of Naughty Dog’s post-apocalyptic tale crucially had a strong connection to the games at the top of its call sheet: Neil Druckmann. Though the co-creator has since left the show to focus on future games, there’s no denying that his presence on HBO’s The Last of Us helped keep it tied to the vision and philosophy of the games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A similar point can be made regarding the highly successful Fallout TV series on Prime Video. Again, a name synonymous with the games was there to root the show in the very detailed canon of such a unique apocalyptic world: Todd Howard. Indeed, Fallout may be a much more appropriate comparison to what HBO is trying to achieve with its Baldur’s Gate show, as Mazin’s project is not attempting to recreate a story one-to-one, but further building out a universe that players already love, while throwing in familiar faces and places along the way. Fallout successfully manages to tell its own story, but also gleefully expands on and references existing lore to great effect. That is, presumably, what the Baldur’s Gate show hopes to achieve, too. </p><p>Don’t let the magic those teams concocted over the past decade disappear into the air – there’s simply no need to create it all from scratch once again.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t think there’s much doubt that both The Last of Us and Fallout have been two of the most successful attempts at translating a video game world to the small screen, so it just makes sense to me to follow that established blueprint and consult Larian on what makes its world so special. I have no doubt that Mazin is a huge fan, and he can certainly write top-tier television, but in order to make sure that this continuation of Baldur’s Gate 3’s story holds the same magic as the genre-defining RPG does, it would be foolish to not involve the Belgian studio in some way. Don’t let the magic those teams concocted over the past decade disappear into the air – there’s simply no need to create it all from scratch once again.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Don't abandon hope, but do expect the world. That's the job.</p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/2019573832520982563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 6, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Don’t abandon hope, but do expect the world. That’s the job”, are Douse’s final words, at least for now, on the announcement. And they ring true. Larian has set the bar incredibly high when it comes to telling stories in this world, and it would certainly be a risky dice roll from HBO to proceed without the modifier of the studio being there to help guide the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Time will only tell, though, on how much Larian ends up being involved in the Baldur’s Gate show. But with Mazin still gearing up to start shooting the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-certainly-seems-that-way-hbo-boss-gives-clearest-indication-yet-that-the-last-of-us-will-end-with-season-3"><u>third, and now likely final, season of The Last of Us</u></a>, it certainly seems we’re a few years away from knowing how successfully it will follow in the footsteps of the game. For now, I live in hope. But then again, I’m somewhat of a doomed optimist.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

Craig Mazin, who created HBO shows Chernobyl and The Last of Us, is in place as showrunner (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-certainly-seems-that-way-hbo-boss-gives-clearest-indication-yet-that-the-last-of-us-will-end-with-season-3">it sounds like The Last of Us will end with Season 3</a>, which now makes a lot of sense). Chris Perkins, the former longtime Head of Story at Hasbro subsidiary Wizards of the Coast, which owns the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe in which Baldur’s Gate 3 is set, will serve as consultant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say the internet has reacted strongly to the news, and from what I can see much of that reaction is a mix of disbelief and concern. Most can’t fathom why anyone would want to continue on from the events of Baldur’s Gate 3 itself, given its many different endings, variances in world state, and, most importantly, the vastly different outcomes for characters such as Astarion, Karlach, and Shadowheart.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There is also significant concern at the fact that Larian, the developer of Baldur’s Gate 3, is not consulting on the show. This was confirmed in a <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019648134645957061" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a> from Larian boss Swen Vincke, who went on to say that Mazin has asked to visit the developer for a chat. “From the conversation we had, I think he truly is a big fan which gives me hope,” Vincke said, perhaps diplomatically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019646146587525143" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went on to offer his thoughts on the show</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Crazy that a story that started out in a small hotel conference room eventually evolved into a narrative inspiring enough for it to become a HBO series,” he said. “We worked incredibly hard on making Baldur's Gate 3 worthy of its legacy. Its characters and narratives are the result of many teams working together and I think I can speak for them all in saying that they'll think this is cool and hope that what comes next will enjoy the same level of passion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventures. There's plenty of directions they could go. I'm eager to find out which ones Craig and his team will pick. He's reached out for a chat so we'll have the opportunity to tell him our thoughts.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Crossing fingers that the story we're cooking up for Divinity will eventually grow to the same heights.

But he then offered a more level-headed view:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I've spent the last 8-10 years of my life with the writers and creators of Baldur's Gate 3 and they're the most incredible storytellers and creators in the space,” <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2019572415878070680" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Douse said</a>. “Only hope is that they get both the credit deserved and the characters are represented at the same level as the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I genuinely don't think anyone can trump our writers. Our stories are built by fierce camaraderie and resolve. I have watched them write and write and write and through respect for audience and material come up with some of the finest shit i have ever played.

With Todd Howard leading the charge, Bethesda is heavily involved in the creation of the smash hit Fallout TV series, which has been praised by fans for nailing the Fallout universe, tone, and aesthetic. The Fallout TV series also avoids the pitfalls of retelling the story of an existing game, nor does it feature main characters from any of the games. Instead, it’s set after the events of all the Fallout games, bringing in new characters and telling new stories, while returning to fan-favorite locations (New Vegas etc).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There will be intense scrutiny on the casting choices for Baldur’s Gate 3. The video game’s characters have become part of the culture, instantly recognizable online, and their actors as high-profile as those in the space get. The idea of an Astarion played by someone other than Neil Newbon, for example, seems almost ridiculous.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">HBO at least knows what an online backlash to a video game adaptation looks like. While Season 1 of The Last of Us was a huge hit and, generally speaking, went down very well with fans, Season 2 has been a mixed bag. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/last-of-us-tv-series-showrunner-wants-you-to-know-he-didnt-kill-anyone-in-real-life-the-actor-is-alive-and-hes-in-literally-everything-else">Mazin himself has spoken openly about this backlash</a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-star-bella-ramsey-tells-season-2-haters-they-dont-have-to-watch-season-3-if-you-hate-it-that-much-the-game-exists">Ellie actor Bella Ramsey told those who hate The Last of Us that they can play the video game instead</a>.
