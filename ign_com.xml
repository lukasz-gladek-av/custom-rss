            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the world of Kaiju No. 8, titanic, otherworldly beasts are a constant threat in Japan: to the extent that not only is there a military organisation – the Japan Anti-Kaiju Defense Force (JAKDF) – set up to deal with them, but there are also regimented clean-up crews whose jobs are to come in and cut up then cart away the often skyscraper-sized foes once they’ve been felled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lead character Kafka Hibino dreams of being a JAKDF officer, but at the start of the series is working in clean-up, and hoping that when there’s work to be done he doesn’t get assigned the intestines… for obvious reasons. It’s not long, however, before he’s – <em>season one spoiler alert here</em> – both a member of the JAKDF and dealing with the fact that he’s somehow been gifted/cursed with the powers of a kaiju himself, designated by the powers that be as Kaiju No. 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stylish action, goofy humour and bad-ass characters all come together to make what follows a whole heap of fun, and frankly, excellent fodder for a video game. Why so? Well, in terms of action, the series focuses around squad-based combat against bizarre and menacing enemies both large and small, with battles decided by exposing each creature’s core (i.e. weak point) and finishing it off. Pair that with highly individual characters, who have a range of expertise in different weapons and fighting styles, and you’ve got a video game waiting to happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter Akatsuki Games, and Kaiju No. 8 The Game. This free-to-play turn-based RPG on mobile (with PC to follow) very much fits the mold for modern Japanese live service mobile games, with gacha rolls for characters and weapons, and numerous different currencies and crafting materials that allow you to level up characters, moves, weapons and more. This is a game with daily check in rewards, time-limited events and grinding for materials so you can enhance your characters and take on the next challenge.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether that’s your kind of thing is up to you, but there’s no doubt that the team has put a lot of effort into this title. Akatsuki Games has been working on Kaiju No. 8 The Game for more than two years – since well before the anime started airing – with a team size of around 200 people. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is a game with excellent presentation, thanks to well-realised 3D character models, a good sense of scale, and super slick combat animations. The core gameplay loop is compelling too, putting you in control of a four person squad in turn-based battles that move quickly and have plenty of room for strategic depth. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kaiju No. 8 The Game also has an impressive amount of content out of the gate. Not only does it have an original story to play through (set during the second season of the anime, which is airing now), complete with an impressive amount of voice acting (in Japanese), but it has other modes that highlight iconic moments from the manga/anime’s story, tell side stories for the main characters, and so on. It even has a side-scrolling combat mini-game.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/side-scrolling-mini-game-1756461272866.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kaiju No. 8's side-scrolling combat mini-game.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s dig into some of the specifics.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What’s the Story?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In Kaiju No. 8 The Game, Dimensional Gates are opening up in the sky and a stream of kaiju threats are swarming out. Is this a job for the JAKDF? Yes, but with a little help from CLOZER (that’s the rather awkward “Closing Order With Zero Restrictions”, in case you’re curious), a special organisation tasked with sealing said gates. The plot twist, however, is that the captain of CLOZER is Sagan Shinomiya – one of a handful of brand new characters – and fan fave Kikoru Shinomiya’s sister.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The set-up allows for a never-ending stream of gameplay as you fight through the kaiju from a particular gate, culminating in a boss battle and closing the gate, then moving on to another. It’s a fun premise, however, as the gates themselves connect to a different dimension, meaning that iconic kaiju that have already been neutralised in Kaiju No. 8’s world can still appear, allowing the game to dive into battles only referenced in the manga/anime. My hands-on, for instance, culminated in a fight with an alternate version of the legendary Kaiju No. 2. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/kaiju-no-2-1756461366397.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kaiju No. 2.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another important point is that while the manga/anime is set entirely in Japan, these gates are opening up globally, so the game can roam all over the place. You can imagine how a live service title might take advantage of travelling to different parts of the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to Sagan, and a couple of other entirely new characters, Kaiju No. 8 The Game is packing all the series mainstays you’d expect, from the captain of the Third Division Mina Ashiro (and her tiger Bakko) and her vice captain Soshiro Hoshina, through to the captain of the First Division (and otaku slacker) Gen Narumi and Kafka’s partner Reno Ichikawa. Each, as you would expect, has a signature weapon and fighting style, from Hoshina’s twin swords through to Sagan’s shield, which she uses like a blunt weapon.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Kafka’s Ultimate sees him transform into Kaiju No. 8… giving him a completely different set of moves.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Kafka is perhaps the most interesting, as he is essentially two characters in one. All the other fighters unleash a flashy attack when their Ultimate is triggered in battle, but Kafka’s Ultimate sees him transform into Kaiju No. 8 for the rest of the encounter, giving him a completely different set of moves.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kaiju No. 8 The Game Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Squad Up!</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The battle system lets you choose a squad of four before each mission, and the order in which you place them creates two pairs of “battle buddies”, dictating who executes follow-up attacks when you expose a kaiju’s core. (More on that in a sec.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is turn-based, with the upcoming move order shown at the bottom of the screen. As you’d expect, characters have a wide array of options from single and multi-target strikes through to buffs and debuffs, but there are a couple of key systems that open up strategy. The first is that your party has a shared SP pool (mana, essentially). A normal attack restores a pip, while using a combat skill depletes one. This approach means you need to be tactical in how you manage your resources in order to use your characters’ most powerful techniques.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of this is the system for exposing an enemy’s core – a pivotal part of combat in the manga/anime that’s been brought across to the game. Enemies have discreet shields (called plates) that reduce the amount of damage they’ll take, so the main priority in any combat encounter is working out the most efficient way to break them. Some plates can be broken with any attack, others require specific types of attacks. You might need to use an elemental attack, or even more specifically, an attack utilising one of the five elements in the game (fire, ice, wind, lightning and water). Obviously different characters have different types of attacks, so ensuring your squad has the affinities necessary for the combat encounter you’re going into is key.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Breaking enemy plates is vital because once you destroy them all, the kaiju in question’s core is exposed, triggering an automatic follow-up attack from the attacking character’s partner and forcing the foe to skip a turn, bumping it back down the turn order sequence at the bottom of screen. It’s pretty satisfying knocking a kaiju back just as it’s about to attack, or better yet, preventing it from unleashing its Ultimate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Ultimates, each character has a gauge that fills as they fight (with follow-up attacks boosting it significantly), and these are – as you’d expect – some of the flashiest and strongest attacks in the game. Ultimates are great for finishing off kaiju with their core exposed, and can be triggered at any time, overriding the upcoming attack order. One thing to bear in mind is that missions are made up of several combat encounters, one after the other (with fast-paced ninja running in between, as the squad sprint to the next battle), and your SP pool and Ultimate charges carry over from battle to battle so, if the final encounter is significantly harder, you can prep for it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/ultimate-cut-scene-kaiju-no-8-1756461500781.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Missions are made up of several combat encounters.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat overall is fast and slick, letting each character show off their individual styles while also working as a team. You’re generally fighting smaller kaiju that attack in groups, but the game does also pit you against the kinds of towering monsters the manga/anime is known for, with the camera set low to really help sell the scale of the encounters.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Enhancing and Ascending</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a good strategic foundation to Kaiju No. 8 The Game’s combat, but as with most RPGs, your characters need to be constantly leveling to keep up with the opposition you’ll face next. There are a somewhat overwhelming number of systems in place to allow your characters to grow more powerful, and they’re pretty much all centered around material drops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to quickly give you an idea, you use Defense Force Manuals (of which there are several rarities), along with credits, to “enhance” (i.e. level up) your characters. These all drop from playing the game and are essentially spendable XP. Initially your characters max out at level 20, but the level caps can be expanded, boosting the character in question and also increasing the challenge level of story missions and opening up higher difficulty training options. (Training, incidentally, is how you get the materials to enhance individual skills, but is subject to a stamina system.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kaiju No. 8 The Game Gameplay</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters can also “Ascend”. This requires you to have a double of the character and other resources, and gives you a bonus perk. On top of all this you can enhance your characters’ weapons and individual skills. There’s a lot to keep track of, and it feels like you’ll need to have a decent pool of competitive characters in order to swap your squad around if you need specific plate-breaking abilities, which means engaging with a tonne of different collectables.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New weapons and characters are acquired through the game’s gacha rolls, and utilise a star system for rarity. For the most part you’ll be getting three star weapons, and it remains to be seen how many rolls free-to-play players will be able to generate, as well as how fairly priced the gacha system will be for paying players. One thing is certain, though – the pool of characters and weapons is pretty large, and the rarest drops infrequent, so if you’re hunting for something specific, it may be a long process. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the many trappings of free-to-play mobile game design, Kaiju No. 8 The Game’s moment to moment gameplay has a lot going for it, with clever core battle mechanics, slick animations and impressive visuals. And with its strong emphasis on story, and clear reverence for the source material, this adaptation will definitely be worth a look for fans of the series. Kaiju No. 8 The Game is out on August 31.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Cam Shea visited Akatsuki Games in Tokyo as a guest.

            <title><![CDATA[NBA 2K26 Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-2k26-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nba-2k26-review-in-progress.1284456/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In many ways, Visual Concepts’ long-running NBA 2K series mirrors the careers of players it works so hard to emulate. Sometimes, it’s a flash of potential: a hotshot rookie catching fire after putting up duds in consecutive games. Others, it’s more comparable to a wily veteran nearing retirement – we see a glimpse of talent, that peek into what it could still be. That’s what keeps me, for better or worse, hoping for the best as I start playing NBA 2K26. It’s both flashy and old school, like a “how do you do, fellow kids” teacher who wears different Jordans to class every day, it has enough cool new kicks, fits, and gimmicks to make it a much more interesting and enjoyable experience than last year’s entry, even after spending only a dozen hours with it so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, “cool” probably isn’t the right word to describe that teacher, let alone NBA 2K26. After all, an annual sports game is obviously not going to be a radically new game, since most of its gameplay and mechanics are fundamentally similar to last year’s iteration, and the one before that, and so on. But in the context of the genre it’s made a good first impression, because several minor improvements cumulatively make such a huge difference to the whole that I’m willing to say it and risk being called a nerd. Yes, I am talking about the new-and-improved shot meter. As always, one of the smallest components in its vast hardwood floor of dribbling and criss-crossing parts leaves a massive influence on how just about everything else on the court plays out.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Green and Slightly Curved</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you were lucky enough not to have experienced last year’s shot meter, I envy you. In place of the nightmare-inducing dial/arrow/ring design from 2K25, NBA 2K26 features a much more intuitive, easier-to-time, and infinitely better-curved bar shot meter. If you’ve heard that before, it’s because it’s similar to 2K23’s – but this isn’t entirely a reversion to that. Instead of remaining static, the new meter’s green field adjusts based on defensive coverage: if a defender is right up in your face, you’ll have practically no chance of making the shot. But if you’re open, it’ll be much easier to time the release right and make a shot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trust me, I’m having so much more fun shooting jumpers now than I was this time last year because I’m actually making them consistently. There is a slight tradeoff, though: because it’s easier to get greens, there’s also less room for imperfection. Meaning if you get a slightly early or slightly late timing, you might as well start running back on defense because the shot will more than likely brick. That said, I’ll take this shot meter any day of the week over a barely improved chance to make mistimed shots. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, I’m a big believer in the concept of “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” because why ruin a good thing, right? But I’m an even bigger believer that if something is broke – like last year’s janky player movement – you b7etter get to fixin’ quick. Visual Concepts did just that because NBA 2K26 makes running, cutting, and defending so much smoother that it makes NBA 2K25’s motion feel like you were stuck running in quicksand. This is no small change because it permeates every single mode, making the entirety of NBA 2K26 feel less robotic and far more natural and enjoyable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, it makes one of my favorite new features, Go-To Post Shots, look even more accurate and realistic. Remember in last year’s review how disappointed I was that I couldn’t dominate the paint with Jokic’s or Embiid’s shimmy shake fade-aways? Well, dreams do come true because for the past day I have been spamming the Sombor Shuffle an ungodly amount of times in each match I play. It is a delightfully methodical, bruising alternative to the agile, quick-twitch motions of the typical Go-To Moves, and I will continue using it until the AI learns to stop it. Until then, it’s barbecue chicken alert each time down the floor.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Now for the bad news. What, you thought it was going to be all good from here on out? Sorry, Dorothy, but the years haven’t been kind to this yellow brick road. And by “yellow brick road,” I mean NBA 2K26’s offline-only modes. Last year, the so-called improvements to MyNBA were underwhelming, to say the least. This time, dear friends, they are practically non-existent, and, as an offline-mode truther, I am very disappointed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With 2K25 we at least had the addition of the Steph Era, even though it already felt redundant alongside two other eras in the 2010s (in addition to the LeBron Era). Are you ready to hear what the 2K26 MyNBA modes have in store? Drumroll, ple…you know what, don’t even bother. It’s called Offseason Scenarios for MyGM. These are tailor-made, long-term quests for each franchise that you must fulfill to appease the fanbase and, more importantly, <em>the owner</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These scenarios come in threes and are given out at the beginning of the offseason. But much like my issues with last year’s MyGM mode, these tasks (and many of the features in the mode itself) again feel forced and, at times, unrealistic. The RPG elements, with their perk and attribute point systems, seem out of place and unnecessary because they hardly make a difference in the grand scheme of basketball operations. At the end of the day, it’s still all about winning as many games and championships as you can. Or, if you’re on the other end of the spectrum, losing and tanking as much as possible. Overall, the whole mode feels like a side project hastily thrown together just to get that last bit of extra credit needed to pass the class.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite my problems with its offline-only modes, the fundamental gameplay tweaks show plenty of promise in what I’ve played on my first day with it. I’m especially excited to see how it looks in MyCareer with its new-and-improved storyline, as well as in the potentially wonky online gameplay of MyTeam. But after suffering through last year’s shot meter and molasses-like movement, there really is nowhere to go but up. Whether that shows in my final verdict and score next week, though, remains to be seen.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-2k26-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"If you are familiar with the original graphics, seeing the current photos really packs an emotional punch."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">From Calorie Mate snacks to hidden Kerotan frog statues, 2004’s Metal Gear Solid 3 was packed with varied real-life Easter eggs, even if they contradicted the game’s 1960s setting. One memorable gimmick for eagle-eyed players to spot in the indoor areas of MGS3 (and MGS2) was the posters of current Japanese gravure idols — female models who pose in revealing outfits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These sexy posters make a return in the remake <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> — with an added twist. If you play on Legacy Style mode, the posters are as they were in the original. But if you are playing using the New Style mode, with its modern over-the-shoulder camera angle, you’ll notice that although the models are the same, the photos have been swapped out for recent shots of what they look like now, two decades on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202508/50274" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Famitsu</u></a> (and previously reported on by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-updates-the-original-games-sexy-posters-with-recent-photos-of-the-same-gravure-models/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>), the developers at Konami revealed how this change came about. They say that their aim with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater was to evolve the game while staying true to the core essence of the original MGS3, and recreate its jungle setting so that it looked extremely realistic. However, they also ended up making small, unexpected tweaks to the content of the original, with the gravure posters being one such tweak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apparently, the initial plan for the model posters was to use higher resolutions of the images used in MGS3. However, once the team had decided to implement a Legacy Mode and a New Mode, they hit upon the idea of changing up the gravure posters to reflect the 21 years that have passed since MGS3’s initial release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Delta’s creative producer Yuji Korekado (who also worked on the original MGS3) explained that for New Style mode, the team decided to reach out to the models that featured in MGS3 and ask them to send in new, recent photos. This does not mean that all the models are decked out in bikinis, though. Rather, the team asked them to simply send in pictures of how they look now. According to Korekado, every single model from the original sent in photos that span the gauntlet from sexy swimsuit shots to family snaps. “We would like players to seek out and find all the different types of photos,” said Korekado, with series producer Noriaki Okamoto adding that “if you are familiar with the original graphics, seeing the current photos really packs an emotional punch.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">MGS3 also featured issues of real-life video game and glamour magazines that you could amusingly use to distract guards (the magazines featured differed depending on the region). However, Korekado said that the decision was made not to update these magazine covers, as many of the publications that popped up as items in MGS3 have since ceased publication. So, the real-life mags that you could find in MGS3 remain the same in both versions of Metal Gear Solid: Delta Snake Eater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Korekado also expresses gratitude towards all the people that returned to work on the remake. He explained that the team was able to get Cythia Harrel to re-record the game’s Bond-esque opening theme ‘Snake Eater,' as well as Kyle Cooper, who designed the intro movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In related news, Lori Alan, who has reprised her role voicing Snake’s mentor The Boss in the game’s English language version, stunned fans yesterday by posting a seemingly recent picture of herself cosplaying as her character:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Choose your fate, finish the mission!
