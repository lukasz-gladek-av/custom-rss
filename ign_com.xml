There is no way to play two-player co-op. We’ve already reported on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-massive-steam-launch-tarnished-by-mixed-user-reviews-over-lack-of-duos-co-op-voice-chat"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign’s ‘mixed’ Steam user review rating</u></a>, with most of the complaints revolving around a lack of a duos option as well as no voice chat.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing Elden Ring Nightreign solo is proving to be a particularly difficult experience. As explained in IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign review</u></a>: "Let’s get the most important caveat out of the way first: if you are hoping to tackle Nightreign entirely solo, and are anything less than a hardcore Elden Ring player that actively seeks out ways to make that already difficult game even more challenging, Nightreign isn’t for you. Yes, there is technically a single-player option, but it is so poorly balanced that I would be shocked if it isn’t patched and adjusted within the first month of release. And this is coming from someone who lives and breathes these types of games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems FromSoftware is moving fast to address solo play. According to the early patch notes, below, next week’s update will add the effect "Automatic Revival Upon Defeat,” which allows revival once per night boss battle, to solo expeditions, and will increase the amount of runs gained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No doubt this patch will just be the start of Elden Ring Nightreign’s balance journey as FromSoftware reacts to fan feedback. It has also suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players">it will release a duos mode for the game at some point in the future</a>, although there’s no timeframe for that.</p><div id="top-25-fromsoftware-bosses" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3><h3>Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite these issues, Elden Ring Nightreign has enjoyed a massive launch on Steam, with an incredible 313,593 peak concurrent users on Steam overnight. That was enough to make Elden Ring Nightreign one of the most-played games on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Elden Ring Nightreign update 1.02 early patch notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The following improvements for solo expeditions will be added to the game:<br>- The effect "Automatic Revival Upon Defeat", which allows revival once per night boss battle, will be added to solo expeditions.<br>- The amount of runes gained will be increased.<br>Thank you for your support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
