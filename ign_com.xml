            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-accessible-games-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">December is a big month for me. It’s a time to celebrate the holidays with friends and family, surprise loved ones with unique gifts, and attempt to reconnect with the ever-growing monstrosity that is my backlog. December is also a time for me to reflect on games that launched throughout the year – especially those that continued to demonstrate the rise in accessibility acceptance, as well as push the innovative boundary for future titles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2024 was rife with accessible games, spanning across numerous genres and developed by various sized studios. As the industry’s understanding and implementation of features and designs continues to evolve, games are far more accessible than before. And with this year-end issue of Access Designed, IGN would like to recognize several games for their accessibility excellence. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-up: Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/accessible-games-2024-dragon-age-the-veilguard-1734540157261.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Bioware’s latest installment in its fantasy RPG series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, is the purest definition of normalizing and standardizing accessibility. Not only does it demonstrate the studio’s increased commitment to disabled players since Dragon Age: Inquisition’s release in 2014, but Veilguard’s accessibility offerings also impressively cater toward an array of disabilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Visual features like subtitle adjustments, colorblind filters, and both melee and ranged threat indicators allow deaf and hard of hearing users to process gameplay information without audio. For blind and low vision players, Veilguard’s options offer audio indicators for incoming attacks, dialogue options, and interactive objects – all of which are crucial for combat, storytelling, and overworld traversal. Physically disabled players can remap controls, toggle options for mechanics like blocking, aiming, and holding inputs, and even remove QTEs and combos with rapid button presses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Veilguard’s greatest accessibility achievement, though, comes in the form of dynamic difficulty. Difficulty is not unanimous. Not only do the rules, methods and understanding of challenge vary between studios, individual games, and player experiences - the majority of difficulty settings only tackle enemy aggression, player damage output, and player health. But in Veilguard, disabled players can alter settings like enemy resistances, enemy vulnerability, timing windows for dodging and parrying, enemy health and aggression. You can even toggle player death, allowing you to remain alive no matter how much damage you take. Combine that with settings that allow players to continuously access previously learned information, have consistent waypoints for objectives and overworld items, and the capability to pause whenever you like, and disabled players are given the chance they need to process each encounter or recover stamina. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Veilguard isn’t perfect. Some features like single stick movement and robust guidance systems are missing. Yet it still acts as the quintessential modern accessible experience. The industry continues to rightfully praise games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-is-the-new-gold-standard-for-accessibility">The Last of Us Part 2</a>, but Veilguard demonstrates it’s time to move beyond the notion that a single game deserves all the accessibility praise. Instead, accessibility is evolving across the industry, and Veilguard is one of this year’s prime examples.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-up: Botany Manor</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/accessible-games-2024-botany-manor-1734540172274.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a common misconception that accessibility can only be achieved by companies owned by wealthy megacorporations like Microsoft or Sony. This belief that accessibility requires dozens of developers and untold amounts of money continues to plague innovation. But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/botany-manor-review">Botany Manor</a>, a low-budget puzzle game, is proof that such a belief is a fallacy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Balloon Studios and published by Whitethorn Games, Botany Manor is a soothing puzzle solving game set in a stately home in 19th century England. This genre is, admittedly, not my favorite – I prefer action and turn-based RPGs. But the accessibility features and design of Botany Manor made this game an unexpectedly pleasant surprise. For starters, it offers full support for mouse and keyboard or controller, depending on your preferred setup. It also offers single stick gameplay, with an option to toggle the capability to look around. Finally, a toggle to sprint is also offered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s an admittedly small selection of options, but they’re augmented by Botany Manor’s impressive use of inclusive design. There are no time limits for solving puzzles; instead players are allowed to take as much time as needed to figure out ways to grow specific plants. Furthermore, puzzles are relegated to a select number of rooms per chapter. Rather than opening the entirety of the manor to players, which could feel overwhelming, those with physical and cognitive disabilities can preserve energy knowing puzzles are within sections. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Botany Manor is by no means perfect, as blind and low vision players will undoubtedly struggle without specific audio-based options. But an indie studio that creates a game with such accessibility-focused attention to inclusive design should be rewarded for its efforts. Botany Manor is proof you don’t need an extensive budget nor dozens of options to make puzzle games accessible.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner: Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/accessible-games-2024-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-1734540187355.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The winner of this year’s accessibility award is bittersweet. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> proved truly innovative for the Metroidvania genre. However, publisher <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-reportedly-moves-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-devs-to-beyond-good-and-evil-2-the-next-ghost-recon-and-a-rayman-remake">Ubisoft recently disbanded the Montpellier-based development team</a> and assigned them across several new projects, meaning that a sequel or future innovations from the studio has very little chance of happening. But I’m not awarding developers because of pity. Rather, I’m awarding the team because they created the most innovatively accessible experience of 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lost Crown offers customizable controls, subtitles, audio indicators for varying attacks, and a toggle that automatically unfreezes your character when frozen by a frost status effect. But these options ultimately pale in comparison to the innovative Memory Shards and Guided Mode features.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Metroidvania genre relies on extensive memorization and backtracking. Areas are meant to be explored numerous times throughout a playthrough, with each segment opening new layers on repeat visits as players acquire new tools or powers. <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/gameplay/article/using-memory-shards-in-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/000106473" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Memory Shards</a> allow players to place a screenshot of a location on the overworld map, reminding them of hidden items or barriers to new routes that can only be accessed with yet-to-be-acquired skills or equipment. Spotted a power up at the beginning of a zone that’s inaccessible? Just place a Memory Shard on the map to remind you to return when you’ve progressed. This feature has been praised as a gameplay tool in general, but it is an incredibly helpful tool for players of all cognitive abilities.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To coincide with Memory Shards, Guided Mode shows players precisely where their next objective is, as well as highlights any upcoming barriers along the path. Combined, these two features dramatically reduce the chance of cognitive overload while still respecting the core feature of a Metroidvania – exploration. While guides and placeable hints are not new to gaming, Metroidvania games have always been dense and obscure and, as a result, cognitively inaccessible. That is until the release of The Lost Crown. This year’s Prince of Persia really is a game (and genre) changer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">2024 continued the trend of improving accessible experiences for disabled players. No longer are we expected to follow specific studios for accessible games. From AAA to indie, disabled players are no longer confined to specific genres because of accessibility offerings. And while barriers still exist, 2024 is indicative of increasing support from studios that continuously adopt the best accessibility practices. Some shortcomings aside, 2024 was as accessible as ever, and another fantastic year for disabled players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Grant Stoner is a disabled journalist covering accessibility and the disabled perspective in video games.

It’s not all reindeer games, though, as Blade Ball fans can now enjoy other non-holiday additions, including 24 swords, 14 explosions, and 12 emotes. There’s also a Blade League event for those looking forward to its release this weekend.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/blade-ball-update-v6-7-roblox-1734375497547.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Blade Ball swings into Christmas with Santa vs. Elves V6.7 update.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Blade Ball update V6.7’s real focus is the features that will help get everyone into the holiday spirit. Santa vs. Elves is a limited-time mode that asks players to pick between two teams: you guessed it, Santa and the Elves. Patch notes describe the mode, saying that players must pick a team, with the goal being to “get the most wins.” The victors unlock rewards, though it’s unclear what all of the prizes include.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a new Reindeer Gacha to take advantage of. Getting eliminations rewards players with free spins, and there’s also a new reindeer mount and pet, too. In addition to the aforementioned swords, explosions, and emotes, there’s also a new cinematic emote camera for those who prefer their Blade Ball experience to be flashy. You’ll have to check into update V6.7 for yourself to see every new Christmas mode and feature, but you can at least take a peak at the reindeer bonuses below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wiigity has packed Blade Ball with a feast of features all month, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blade-ball-receives-a-new-battle-pass-alongside-version-66-update"><u>another recent update</u></a> adding in a new battle pass, mode, rewards, and more.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-hidden-ones-hitori-no-shita-the-outcasts-preview-not-just-a-pretty-face</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-hidden-ones-hitori-no-shita-the-outcasts-preview-not-just-a-pretty-face.1064997/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-hidden-ones-hitori-no-shita-the-outcasts-preview-not-just-a-pretty-face<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The comeback wasn’t going to happen. I was blowing it. I lost my first character in my first match of The Hidden Ones because I didn’t cash out with my Ultimate Skill, but I made a comeback with my mid before losing her to my opponent’s anchor. I didn’t have a great answer for what he was doing, and I was convinced I was going to waste what had started off as a great comeback. Then my anchor came out. It was my first game; I’d never used her before. And at first, it was going about the same, and then I realized what I was doing. I canceled my default combo into another combo then another, and cashed out with my Ultimate. And on the last hit, I got the kill. God, I love fighting games, and if my time with it is any indication, The Hidden Ones is living up to what makes the genre so great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not up on The Lore ™, The Hidden Ones is based on the anime Hitori No Shita: The Outcasts, which in turn is based on Under One Person, a Chinese webcomic. Whew. Okay, so the history is a little complicated, but you don’t really need to know what’s going on with the other parts of the series to vibe with The Hidden Ones. I have no experience with the anime, but I was able to follow what I saw pretty easily. I started with the story mode, which dropped me into the shoes of Wang Ye. Ye is one of the Outcasts, blessed with one of the Eight Secret Arts, which were generally believed to have been lost to time. Once people figure out what Wang Ye has, though, they go after him to get it. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Hidden Ones (Hitori No Shita: The Outcasts) Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Wang Ye tries to nip this in the bud by speaking with Li Gaofeng, the head of the Li Troupe, and trying to convince him to leave Wang and his family alone. Impressed by Wang’s gumption and fighting prowess, Li agrees to let him go and leave his family alone. Of course, things don’t go as planned and Wang finds himself framed for Li’s murder and battling the Li Troupe as he tries to escape.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Devil’s in the Details</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Whew, okay, set up. What’s cool, though, is the game Morefun games has made out of this. The Hidden Ones would probably be best described as an arena fighter, but you don’t just go from fight to fight. Between the fights themselves, you’ve got the ability to run around and check out The Hidden Ones’s world, whether that means enjoying the environmental detail on display or checking out a ledger or diary you find in the world. This attention to detail is important: during an interview that happened between my two play sessions, Lead Game Designer Fox Lin and Senior Game Designer Stan Fan told me that the team at Morefun spent a long time capturing the detail of these environments, many of which are based on actual, individual Chinese streets. They wanted the world of The Hidden Ones to feel real, and that comes across even in the relatively small area I was playing in.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The same is true of The Hidden Ones’s visual style. This game is stunning, and that attention to detail is clear in everything from the characters to the way they fight. This is intentional, too. The story and world of The Hidden Ones are based heavily (though not exclusively) in Chinese martial arts and myth, and that meant getting the little details right, right down to the motion capture done by real martial artists. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>These are regular people, and that’s a major part of the story here, even if they are throwing punches and casting magic.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Morefun is also quick to note that while the Outcasts are incredibly powerful, they’re also folks going about their day. Maybe they’re going out to buy groceries or just using their abilities to accomplish their goals in subtle ways. The point is these are regular people, and that’s a major part of the story here, even if they are throwing punches and casting magic.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Like a Flowing Stream</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of the fighting, The Hidden Ones feels great when you’re throwing punches. This is an arena fighter, so movement is crucial, but the rock-paper-scissors interactions of what makes a fighting game a game fighting work are here, too. You’ve got your basic attacks, which lose to special attacks; those losey to your defensive stance; and your defensive stance loses to attacks, which become throws if they’re in that stance. There’s also a dodge, which costs a limited amount of stamina, and you can time perfectly for a Witch Time-style slowdown that will allow you to retaliate when you otherwise wouldn’t, and a parry that you can perform out of your defensive stance during special attacks, so you can swap from defense to offense with a well-timed button press.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Stamina also comes into play on offense. You can spend it to cancel actions — whether they’re physical or special attacks — allowing you to build custom combos and combos into your Ultimate Skills, which is how I won that match I told you about at the start. If you’re the one getting your face rearranged, you can also spend stamina to break out of combos and reset to neutral. Put together, all of this means that, despite The Hidden Ones’s fairly simple control scheme and combo structure, you’re constantly making interesting choices where you’re alternating between playing neutral, reacting, and pre-empting your opponent, all while managing your character’s unique skills (Wang Ye, for instance, has a special attack that can go into three different variations). The right play at the right time, like say, throwing out a special attack when you think they’re going to swing at you, can swing a match.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nah, He Just Looks Big</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The real meat and potatoes, and my favorite part of my time with The Hidden Ones, is going to be the mano a mano fights between your three-person teams against other players, but I also really enjoyed the three boss fights I got to play. The first, which I ran into during the story mode, started off as a one-on-one brawl before the boss in question brought out her skyscraper-sized snake, forcing me to play around its massive fangs before its master would come down and I could get back to the fine art of knocking her out.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Arena fighters are a tricky business, but so far Morefun has nailed the balance of simplicity, depth, and game feel that any good fighter needs.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If that’s not enough for you, though, there’s also Trial mode, where you can face off against a boss with any of the characters you’ve got. There were two available in the demo I played, and both were challenging, especially on the highest of the available difficulties. Both eventually went down, but they forced me to use characters I knew, pick my spots, and learn their patterns. It’s a fun change of pace for a game like this, and I’m eager to see what other fights look like in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When my time with The Hidden Ones ended, I left excited, and wishing I could have played more, especially more multiplayer. But I left with a good idea of what Morefun is trying to accomplish, and I liked how much cool stuff there was and how unique and interesting the characters they’ve created here are. Arena fighters are a tricky business, but so far Morefun has nailed the balance of simplicity, depth, and game feel that any good fighter needs while providing more to do if you’re not looking to throw down online. I’m excited to see where The Hidden Ones goes, and in the meantime, I’ll be thinking about landing that Ultimate Skill at the right moment, and how cool it was that The Hidden Ones gave me the options to play how I wanted in that moment. Like its characters, The Hidden Ones knows even when the chips are down and the outcome is uncertain, there’s always a play to be made, hidden in plain sight.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
