It’s rare to see such a complete slate of first-party releases lined up this early, which makes today’s deals list worth bookmarking if you plan on building out a Switch 2 library.</p><p id="tldr-deals-for-today"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TL;DR: Deals For Today">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all, today’s roundup also features Pokémon TCG deals that fall below market value. In several cases, Amazon’s pricing has dipped under TCGPlayer’s, which is usually the lowest benchmark for sealed product. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z31krq?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Unova Poster Collection is $39.98 on Amazon</a> versus <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxxqjm?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$28.77 on TCGPlayer</a>, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5XynY?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prismatic Evolutions Mini Tin is $33.28 at Amazon</a> compared to <a href="https://zdcs.link/z31krK?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$24.87 on TCGPlayer</a>. Those kinds of gaps show which items are trending under market value right now, and they’re the deals most collectors will want to move on quickly.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amyet V9-G60 Electric Bike for $477.47</h2><div catalogid="36a3b9f5-2ced-42c2-8fd0-f4fa3b4e7cdd" id="227220"><p data-cy="paragraph">AliExpress is offering an outstanding deal on a popular entry level electric bike.

You're buying it from Amyet's official store on AliExpress. It ships free locally from the United States and arrives within 1 to 2 weeks. You'd be hard pressed to find a new electric bike for under $500 stateside, especially one that has a 1,000W motor (the least expensive bikes cost more and are usually rated for 750W). The same bike <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJEdr?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">is priced at $500 plus $165 shipping on Amazon</a>, so you'd paying nearly $200 more buying it from there.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Price Watch</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking to stock up on sealed Pokémon TCG product, TCGPlayer remains the most reliable place for market-low pricing across the board. The vast majority of booster packs, tins, and trainer boxes are sitting cheaper there than on Amazon, often by $5-$15. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bundles like the<a href="https://zdcs.link/av3rj0?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> White Flare Binder Collection</a> and the S<a href="https://zdcs.link/ao6WqY?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">hining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</a> are up to $40 off, deals that everyone should be snapping up right now. It’s worth keeping an eye on these dips, since Amazon tends to fluctuate prices more often than dedicated TCG retailers.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Below Market Value</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While TCGPlayer is often the go-to marketplace for low Pokémon TCG prices, a handful of sealed products are currently cheaper on Amazon, making them below market value and worth grabbing. Right now, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPVYkD?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black Bolt Booster Bundle is available for $50.01 on Amazon</a>, while the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeKMY5?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">White Flare Booster Bundle has dipped under $46</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collectors looking for nostalgic sets can also snag the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbMmOe?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket Tin at $41.24,</a> or the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxqjY?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paradox Pokémon Stacking Tin at $26.32</a>. Even seasonal products like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wjq3N?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Trick or Trade BOOster Bundle (2024)</a> are under market at $21.22, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOgXrE?object_uuid=79785a72-c771-475e-af6c-ecb2d401475b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Unova Mini Tin</a> rounds out the list at just $19.99. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Invest In Silver Tempest Now</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silver Tempest has proven to be one of the most collector-driven sets of the Sword and Shield era, with prices pulled between nostalgia, competitive play, and limited supply. The clear winner is Lugia V (Alternate Full Art) 186/195, which has surged 68% since July to $427, cementing itself as the set’s chase card. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trainer Gallery standouts like Rayquaza VMAX TG20/TG30 and Blaziken VMAX TG15/TG30 have also doubled or tripled in value thanks to strong artwork and nostalgia, while even Lugia VSTAR continues climbing on competitive strength. At the same time, cards like Regidrago V (Alternate Art) and Alolan Vulpix VSTAR have cooled as the meta shifted away from them, with values slipping back toward the $12–$14 range. </p><p id="snag-classic-mega-evolution-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Snag Classic Mega Evolution Cards">Snag Classic Mega Evolution Cards Before Market Rise</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The market for XY-era Mega Evolution Pokémon cards is heating up fast ahead of Pokémon Legends: Z-A and the upcoming Mega Evolution TCG set. Collectors aren’t waiting for modern reprints, they’re chasing the originals, and prices are showing it. Some cards have exploded in value, while others have steadied after sharp climbs, creating both momentum plays and entry points for buyers. Leading the surge is M Rayquaza EX (Shiny Full Art - Ancient Origins), which has skyrocketed over 426% this year, from $275 in January to $1,450 today. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">M Gengar EX (Secret Rare - Phantom Forces) isn’t far behind, up nearly fivefold to $415, cementing its place as one of the most sought-after Megas. Other heavy-hitters include M Rayquaza EX (Full Art - Roaring Skies), now at $656, M Charizard EX (X - Flashfire) climbing past $349, and Primal Groudon EX (Shiny Full Art), which has more than doubled to $349. These climbers show how nostalgia, unique mechanics, and iconic artwork are driving a collector frenzy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But not every Mega Evolution is running away in price. Some cards have plateaued after strong early-year gains, leaving a rare buying window before the next spike. M Mewtwo EX (Full Art - BREAKthrough) climbed from $37 to $145 but has leveled off in recent weeks, while M Alakazam EX (Full Art - Fates Collide) sits steady just under $100 after jumping from $28 earlier this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even Charizard is showing signs of cooling, M Charizard EX (Generations) and M Charizard EX (Full Art - Evolutions) have tripled since January but are holding in the $190-$200 range for now. These pauses don’t signal weakness; rather, they reflect consolidation before the broader Mega Evolution wave hits with new set releases. For collectors and investors, the message is clear: the grails are climbing fast, but the plateaued cards may be the smarter pickups before Mega hype takes over the market again.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Crown Zenith Prices Are Rising</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Crown Zenith market has been showing two very different stories this month. On one hand, several Galarian Gallery Ultra Rares are slipping as hype fades, with fan-favorites like Leafeon VSTAR and Suicune V dropping more than 20% from their peaks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, the gold Secret Rares are climbing steadily, led by Giratina VSTAR and Arceus VSTAR, as collectors chase the scarce, high-end pieces of the set. This split reflects a maturing market: casual collectors are less interested in mid-tier Eeveelutions and V cards, while serious players and investors are doubling down on the big four golds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the crashers, Leafeon VSTAR has fallen from nearly $50 to the $43 range, and Glaceon VSTAR is down 26% since February, hovering in the mid-$30s. Deoxys VMAX has slipped under $37, while Suicune V and Raikou V both lost more than a quarter of their value since spring. These are still striking artworks, but set fatigue and limited competitive relevance are pushing prices down. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the climbers are commanding all the attention. Giratina VSTAR (Secret) has surged nearly 20% since July to $180, making it the definitive chase of Crown Zenith. Mewtwo VSTAR is also up more than 30% this summer, with its Charizard battle artwork driving collector demand. Rounding out the gains, Arceus VSTAR, Origin Forme Dialga VSTAR, and Origin Forme Palkia VSTAR are all trending higher as well, thanks to their powerful abilities and limited supply. Taken together, the set still holds broad collector appeal, but it’s clear the market is consolidating around the golden Secret Rares as the safest long-term holds.</p><p id="first-party-switch-2-preorders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="First Party Switch 2 Preorders">First Party Nintendo Switch 2 Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s 2025 first-party lineup is shaping up to be one of its strongest in years. Pokémon Legends: Z-A is set to arrive in October, followed closely by Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 bundled together for Switch 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then in December, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond lands with its own set of new amiibo figures, alongside Kirby’s big return in Kirby Air Riders. Between new entries in cornerstone franchises and fresh collectible amiibo launches, fans will have plenty to keep their Switch 2 libraries stocked through the holidays.</p><p id="third-party-switch-2-preorders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Third Party Switch 2 Preorders">Third Party Switch 2 Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The third-party slate for Switch 2 is just as impressive, with several big franchises making the jump to the new hardware. Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection launches in December with a full set of classic fighters, while Borderlands 4 and Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake hit this fall. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, titles like Hades II, Octopath Traveler 0, and Cronos round out the lineup for RPG fans. Whether you’re into fighters, shooters, or sprawling JRPGs, the Switch 2’s preorder catalog already feels packed, and today’s deals cover every one of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
