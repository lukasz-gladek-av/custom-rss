Not only do we have the launch of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-its-taking-all-possible-measures-to-beat-switch-2-scalpers">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and its exclusive games to contend with, but we’ve got a long list of big hitters set for later in 2025, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>. And then there’s the inevitable new Call of Duty from Activision, no doubt set for October or November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the big one is Rockstar’s guaranteed behemoth <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which is still down for release in fall 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. Will it be delayed? Parent company Take-Two is so far sticking to the fall 2025 release window, but it’s that uncertainty coupled with all the other huge shooters coming out that means EA’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-official-look-at-new-battlefield-gameplay-as-ea-reveals-battlefield-labs">Battlefield</a> may face a tricky job carving out some space for itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has the next Battlefield down for its 2026 fiscal year, which means before April 2026. That’s prime GTA 6 territory right there, and maybe even prime Call of Duty and Borderlands 4 territory. So, how much does EA have to consider release dates from competing games when it comes to working out when to launch Battlefield?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A fair bit, EA CEO Andrew Wilson admitted in a recent financial call — and it may even be willing to delay Battlefield if it has to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Certainly we exist in a competitive marketplace,” Wilson said in response to a question from an analyst on this exact topic. “I've had the great fortune to be in this company for 25 years and we have done a great job of competing with all of our great franchises over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That being said, we've invested more in this Battlefield than any Battlefield before. We have four studios. We've had a meaningful amount of time. We're looking for this to be the biggest Battlefield we've ever made. And we of course want to make sure that we launch that into a window where we can deliver on the fullness of the promise of what Battlefield can be and grow the community to a level that is commensurate with the size of the game that we're making.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I do believe that this year might be a nuanced year relative to competition. There may be some things happening in the year that may cause us to think differently about our launch timing. We have an FY 26 launch window that the team is targeting. We believe the game will be great and ready at that time, but if we got close to that timeframe and believed that this wasn't going to be a great window for us, then we would take a look at what an alternate window might be that would give us the appropriate time, energy, and player acquisition opportunity for this Battlefield to be all that it needed to be.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As it stands, the new Battlefield will be out before April 2026. Let’s say November 2025 (Battlefield 2042 came out November 2021 and Battlefield 5 came out November 2018). What if GTA 6 launches in or around then? Perhaps EA will, in response, push Battlefield back to the first quarter of 2026, still making its fiscal year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what if it intends to release Battlefield Q1 2026 already, and then Rockstar announces a GTA 6 delay to Q1 2026? Could EA bring Battlefield forward? Or maybe it would, in that case, push Battlefield out of the fiscal year and into the next. That would be a big decision, but based on Wilson's comments, something EA is prepared for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see why EA, and, we’ve heard, many other third-party publishers are holding their breath as they wait for Rockstar to announce the news the entire industry is hanging on: the GTA 6 release date. Once that’s out in the open, whether it’s for this fall as planned or a delay into 2026, all the other pieces will fall no doubt into place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The developer was last week called "hilariously toxic," "predatory," and "downright greedy" after finally introducing trading to the trading card game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the standard Pokémon TCG Pocket mechanic that restricts players from opening packs or Wonder Picking or, now, trading too much without spending real world money, the feature was also introduced with these Trade Tokens as an extra restriction. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-trading-today-and-players-absolutely-hate-it">Players criticized the high cost of obtaining these</a>, as they essentially had to delete from their collections five cards before trading one of the same rarity.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Space Time Smackdown</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's now been eight days since Creatures Inc. released trading to the incredible backlash, but it did have a heads up that fans weren't impressed when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-trading-unveiled-but-is-so-poorly-received-the-developers-had-to-respond">it outlined the feature almost three weeks ago</a>. "Your concerns are seen," it said at the time. "Once this feature becomes available, I'd like to invite everyone to try it and provide feedback."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This made many players believe things would be better than expected, but this wasn't certainly the case. Creatures Inc. eventually responded by admitting "some of the restrictions put in place are preventing players from being able to casually enjoy" trading.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also promised to alleviate complaints by introducing required items as rewards in upcoming events but has already failed to do so as the Cresselia ex Drop Event released February 3, includes none.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans complained trading is fairly clearly being implemented as a means of increasing revenue for Pokémon TCG Pocket, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">is estimated to have made $200 million in its first month</a>, before trading was possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is also evidenced by the inability to trade cards of 2 Star rarity or higher, as if players could immediately trade for their missing cards, they wouldn't need to spend $10 or $100 or more for a random chance of getting them. It cost one player around $1,500 just to complete the first set, for example, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-space-time-smackdown-expansion-today-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">the third in three months arrived last week</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
