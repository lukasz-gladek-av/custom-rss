It’s twofold. For one, this product seems squarely aimed at being a gift option this holiday season. The other is that, despite high hopes from Wizards of the Coast, the Spider-Man set just didn’t take off as they’d hoped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe it’s product fatigue, maybe it’s the set’s less-than-compelling mechanics, but it’s still got some awesome artwork that’s ideal for collectors and casual players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Magic: The Gathering, check out a hefty discount on a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-magic-the-gathering-x-final-fantasy-commander-deck-is-better-than-half-price"><u>Final Fantasy 6 Commander Deck</u></a>, one of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-of-my-favorite-magic-the-gathering-commander-decks-is-just-25-for-black-friday"><u>my personal favorite precons for new players</u></a>, and even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-x-final-fantasy-boosters-down-to-lowest-price-ever-for-black-friday"><u>a big saving on Final Fantasy booster boxes</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.
