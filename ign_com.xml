Even Stomp and the Sword of Miracles, an indie game with no release date plans anywhere in sight, elected to delay its Kickstarter launch and demo release due to Silksong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in an episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opeNl55y-0Y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Friends Per Second</u></a>, as spotted by <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/hell-is-us-developer-silksong-release-date-surprise-was-a-little-callous/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>This Week in Videogames</u></a>, Hell is Us' Jonathan Jacques-Belletête said of Team Cherry: "When you know you're that big, I think a shadow drop is a bit like... wow."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"As the 'GTA 6 of indie'… to shadow drop something like this is a little callous," Jacques-Belletête added, but while he admitted there was a flurry of "emails and texts and messages back and forth between a lot of people, between us and our publisher — it was a real thing — we decided to keep the date, and I’m happy that we did."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’re still much bigger than some of the smaller ones who would have gotten a lot more affected and who decided to change their dates — changing the date of Hell Is Us would have been a pretty big endeavour," he explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The real pain in the ass is that you have to refund your pre-orders when you do that, right? That’s the real, ‘How you gonna do this?’ — now you need to rebuild them. We didn’t say, ‘Oh my god, we have to do it, but we can’t because of that.' We were like, ‘No, I think we can get through the storm’.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Honestly, it’s not just Silksong, there was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos [The New Dawn]</a>, it was a busy time.

For example, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/slay-the-spire-2"><u>Slay the Spire 2</u></a> was recently delayed to March 2026, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/slay-the-spire-2-release-date-slips-to-march-2026-and-no-it-had-nothing-to-do-with-silksong-dev-insists"><u>but the team proactively refuted any suggestion it was because of Silksong</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hell is Us is out now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"The programmers back then were afraid of bugs…"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Final Fantasy series’ iconic victory fanfare has been a staple feature for the majority of the long-running RPG franchise since the very first entry in 1987. However, series composer Nobuo Uematsu recently revealed that a music programmer’s accidental discovery was what enabled him to give Final Fantasy’s battle themes and fanfare a truly punchy, driving drumbeat for the very first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At a recent sold-out event reported on by <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/kikaku/2045647.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GameWatch</u></a>, Uematsu talked in detail about Final Fantasy III's score and its development. With a soundtrack that incorporated a wider variety of tunes including comical pieces, Uematsu credits Final Fantasy III as a turning point in which he established his approach to composing music for RPGs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Uematsu emphasized that there was a stark difference in Final Fantasy III’s music quality compared to Final Fantasy I and Final Fantasy II, even though they were composed using the same equipment and for the same console (the Famicom / NES). Although most games only used four of the NES’s audio channels, Uematsu revealed that Final Fantasy III made heavy use of a particular drum sound on the fifth channel, which was discovered completely by accident during development.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/14/gettyimages-156598107-1757879498904.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nobuo Uematsu has discussed the creation of Final Fantasy's iconic victory fanfare. Photo by David Wolff - Patrick/Redferns via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Uematsu recalls that the game’s music programmer Hiroshi Nakamura came to him one day with a kick drum-like sound he had discovered. Uematsu was very excited to make use of this. Although the NES’s “white noise” channel could be used for hi-hat and snare drum-like percussion effects, this kick drum sound provided exactly what Uematsu had been looking for to add a more driving rhythm to battle themes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Nakamura expressed misgivings, concerned that it may cause issues with the game. Uematsu explained: "The programmers back then were afraid of bugs and so they didn't want to play that kick drum sound," adding that he reassured them that he would stop using the kick drum sound if it caused problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, no such issues occurred. Uematsu successfully used this drum sound to create a punchier version of the fanfare, as well as to add a driving drum beat to battle themes. He particularly highlighted how important Nakamura’s kick drum was to Final Fantasy III’s ‘This is the Last Battle,’ and proudly observed that the first four bars “still have a rich sound even today.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even 35 years on, Uematsu said that he still really wants to know exactly how Nakamura came across the drum sound, but apparently the music programmer no longer remembers. Uematsu joked that "he must have had his memory erased by aliens."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The NES had only five audio channels. The “pulse wave” channels 1 and 2 were the main ones used for melodies, “triangle wave” channel 3 was often used for basslines, and channel 4 was for “white noise." Channel 5 was for PCM samples (which could be used for comparatively higher quality sounds, such as voice samples). "I didn't know about that fifth channel (at the time)," revealed Uematsu, adding that such samples took up a lot of memory so "hardly anyone used it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Uematsu, he asked a younger colleague for their opinion on how the sound was created. “I wasn’t an engineer back then so I don’t know the details, but I think they were definitely doing something with the PCM channel,” they supplied, surmising that if Final Fantasy III’s devs were able to produce the drum sound without using imported waveform data, they may have cleverly utilized the PCM channel's on/off function. The act of switching the channel on and off might have been used to produce this sound without using up limited memory. However, this will remain a mystery until someone who actually worked on the game reveals exactly how it was done (if anyone remembers).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Uematsu credits Hiroshi Nakamura’s involvement in Final Fantasy III for helping him to shape his ideas into music and convincing him that incorporating varied types of music (such as comical pieces) made RPG soundtracks more interesting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by David Wolff - Patrick/Redferns via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

Fox <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/autumn25/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a>. "From last time's updates, you guys have access to exactly how long each step of the development took. Anyway, we don't have any external factors surrounding the release date this time. We'll release it when it's done, and we will continue to update you guys on the progress of its completion. Thanks!"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fox also took the opportunity to describe exactly where in the development cycle Deltarune Chapter 5 is, revealing that the "early parts" are complete, albeit needing a little polish. The last "40%-or-so" is in a "rough first pass state, and the last 10% is in a prototyping state."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Probably around 85% of cutscenes have been created up to a first draft state, however, of those at least 20% or so will require more polish," Fox said, adding that regular enemies are mostly done, with at least one programmer already working on the regular enemy bullet patterns of Chapter 6. The "direction of the boss battles" has been decided, and boss attacks have already been planned and completed. The next step is to "arrange the attacks and make adjustments to them if necessary to fit the atmosphere of the battle."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With Chapter 3 &amp; 4, there were some creative 'hurdles' which made developing parts of the game difficult. How to do the Boards of Chapter 3, how to design the events in Noelle's house, etc.," Fox added. "Once we got past those hurdles and expanded the team, everything went much more smoothly. Chapter 5 was not without hurdles! But... we already passed all of the obvious ones, so there's little to get in our way now! We just need to keep making the game." Only one "main deadline" has been outlined for the rest of 2025, and that's to kick off translation by the end of the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The good news is that anyone new to Deltarune still has time to catch up. We thought what we've played thus far is 'Amazing,' awarding it 9/10, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deltarune-full-release"><u>writing</u></a>: "Even though the journey is only halfway to completion, Deltarune's incredible story is already bursting with hilarious charm, unforgettable characters, and an iconic soundtrack that make it worth investing your time in." A "sequel" of sorts to beloved indie RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/undertale"><u>Undertale</u></a>, it has released chapter by chapter starting in 2018, with Chapter 2 releasing in 2021 and the two most recent chapters <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-are-out-now-and-its-already-exploding-on-steam"><u>dropping alongside the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 earlier this year</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

However, Steam reviews are ‘mixed,’ with most of the complaints revolving around PC performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Gearbox posted a Borderlands 4 Nvidia Optimization guide on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/679602429802577921" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>, advising players how to optimize their graphics settings for “better performance and framerates” on PC with the Nvidia app.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox then issued a piece of advice to PC gamers that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-asks-pc-gamers-to-keep-playing-for-at-least-15-minutes-after-they-tweak-settings-to-see-how-performance-has-changed-as-negative-steam-reviews-pile-up"><u>to me reads like an effort to prevent players from making knee-jerk reactions to the game's performance as soon as they’ve changed their settings</u></a>: “Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile.
