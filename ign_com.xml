            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Variety is, as they say, the spice of life, and 2025 provided a fantastic array of different video games. We’ve survived and extracted from the robot-ruled battlefields of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, adventured across the medieval lands of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, and established mind-expanding exhibitions in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/two-point-museum-review">Two Point Museum</a>. We helped <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/keeper">Keeper</a>’s sentient lighthouse solve puzzles, and unearthed the secrets buried in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/atomfall">Atomfall</a>’s eerie England. But which of the year’s many different video games is worthy of being crowned the very best of 2025? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every December, the IGN team considers all the games they’ve collectively played and reviewed across the year, and votes on which one they think is the greatest of them all. Which one is the “Game of the Year”? Sometimes that choice is incredibly difficult. Other years, it’s easy. 2025 was the latter, with our winner securing almost three-quarters of the vote. But what is that near-universally admired game? That’s what we’re here to reveal.   </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we run down the games that made it onto our final shortlist, we’d like to recognise several other brilliant experiences that we’ve had this year. Hazelight Studios once again proved that it's the king of co-op with the wonderful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, a creative action platformer that builds atop the successes of 2021’s It Takes Two with some of the most surprising and innovative level design that we’ve seen not just this year, but this decade. There was some interesting innovation happening over at Konami, too. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, developer NeoBards Entertainment took the series’ trademark oppressive horror and blended it with a novel approach to new game plus to create a remarkable story that deepens with each replay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking of replays, that’s the name of the game for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ball-x-pit">Ball x Pit</a>, the brick-breaking roguelike from Kenny Sun and Devolver Digital, whose furious action had us coming back for one more run time and time again. So long as our time wasn’t being stolen by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, of course – Level-5’s smart blend of Animal Crossing’s cosy slice-of-life and The Legend of Zelda’s dungeon diving turned out to be a real comfort game for us this year. The same could be said for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, too, which rekindled happy memories of 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima, but boosted all of that game’s good ideas with even deeper mechanics and more striking landscapes. It’s safe to say that 2025 was pretty good for games, and we’ve not even discussed the very best of them, yet. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/best-game-of-2025-death-stranding-2-1765184626390.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly half of our shortlist for the Best Game of 2025 is made up of sequels that faced tough challenges. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> arguably faced the most difficult one: how to turn a divisive “walking sim” into something more universally beloved, without betraying its core, admittedly niche values? The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly for a Kojima Productions project, was to look back to Metal Gear Solid and incorporate the freedom of The Phantom Pain into this open-world delivery simulator. A constantly rolling conveyor belt of gear, from ladders and boots to coffin hoverboards and weaponised electric guitars, ensures you always have the tools to tackle Death Stranding 2’s missions on your own terms. While this is still a game fundamentally about transporting items from location A to location B, no two deliveries feel the same. An ever-evolving and adapting world sees journeys that once unfolded on foot upgraded to make use of roads, ziplines, and eventually monorails, with destinations pursued either via your own pathways or by making use of creative solutions designed by other players. Such a journey isn’t purely physical, either; as you travel, your growing team supports you through an emotional ordeal that ponders the value of human connection. All this ensures that On the Beach finally fulfills the unique promise of the original Death Stranding. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Hades 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/best-game-hades-2-1765184663988.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The creative juggernaut that is Supergiant Games likely could have simply recreated its 2020 roguelike hit, Hades, with just a few mechanical upgrades and still received critical acclaim. And, on the surface, that’s what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hades-ii">Hades 2</a> appears to be. It takes just a single scratch to reveal the truth about this incredibly ambitious sequel, though, which smartly rethinks and remixes many of its predecessor’s fundamentals. Yes, this is still a game in which you battle as far as you can through the branching routes of a dungeon until death forces you to start all over again, but new protagonist Melinoë’s quest to kill Chronos, the Titan of Time, takes place along two opposing routes. Every run starts with a choice: ascend Mount Olympus, or descend into Tartarus. Each location provides entirely different bosses, biomes, storylines, and challenges, which solves the age-old roguelike issue of grinding repetition. Stuck on a formidable boss? There’s an entire other world to conquer instead. And conquer you will, armed with the most refined set of skills and upgrades the genre has seen. This is a buildcrafter's dream, even in spite of the random nature of your God-given boons, and each run is an opportunity to mold Mel into a brand new kind of magic weapon. With unrivaled art and music, and one of the tightest combat systems around, Hades 2 is a spectacular triumph.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/best-game-hollow-knight-silksong-1765184646367.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The eight-year wait for Hollow Knight’s sequel did the expectations around Silksong no favours. This wasn’t just one of the most anticipated indie projects of all time – many major series with decades of history would envy this kind of attention. Some would say it’s nothing short of a miracle that Silksong met (and arguably exceeded) those expectations, but the reality is anchored in creative talent, clear vision, and exceptional art. This is one of the most beautifully drawn video games of the generation, packed with haunting caverns, overgrown dungeons, and myriad more unmissable vistas. Such regions are not just pretty, but precision-engineered to provide some of the best platforming challenges this side of Celeste and Super Meat Boy. And at the heart of each level are the exhilarating boss fights that are partially responsible for Silksong’s fiendish reputation. Yes, this is an unapologetically challenging adventure that stings as fiercely as any of its insectoid characters. But it never strikes unfairly, and its elegant Metroidvania map always offers an alternative route, should a foe prove too imposing. In a world where difficult games have perhaps become something of an oversubscribed format, the idea of a challenge being truly worth the pain has perhaps worn a little thin. But in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, developer Team Cherry really has crafted a treasure worth fighting for.     </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Blue Prince</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/best-game-blue-prince-1765184557780.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The roguelite is nothing if not an incredibly malleable genre. You can make an action RPG roguelite, a shooter roguelite, a card game roguelite, even a puzzle roguelite – although that latter one is certainly rarer than the others. Joining that small roster of looping head-scratchers is Dogubomb’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/blue-prince">Blue Prince</a>, an elegantly crafted labyrinth in which the corridors are all of your choosing. Every new run is, fundamentally, an attempt to find a mysterious hidden room within a sprawling mansion where every new chamber you enter is chosen from a random selection of blueprints. But that overall goal is ultimately less important than the many secrets that await in every fresh attempt – room combinations that unlock clues to further mysteries, and breathtaking discoveries that deepen the house’s story. Its random nature is the initial obstacle, as building rooms in the correct order is all but impossible when you don’t know which blueprints you’ll be dealt. But soon you realise that the real challenge is in logic, pattern, and connections. And when you finally see the fine lines that link its many ideas together, it instantly becomes clear how immaculately constructed Blue Prince is.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Donkey Kong Bananza</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/best-game-of-2025-donkey-kong-bananza-1765184602875.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When Nintendo launched the original Switch, it did so with the open world-redefining Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. And so with Switch 2, the pressure was on to craft yet another ground-breaking launch window game. Nintendo took on that mission quite literally with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, in which your core interaction with the world is to shatter it into tiny chunks. We’ve had games with destructible environments before, but there’s nothing quite like Bananza’s complete demolition of its levels, which somehow still manage to maintain their Mario-grade craftsmanship even after having been pummeled to pieces. That terrain is filled with buried collectables, and excavating them often requires the completion of clever challenges that feel satisfying to solve every single time. The banana on top of this platforming delight, though, is the duo of DK and Pauline, whose pairing is not only charming, but also mechanically powerful: the titular Bananzas, activated via catchy songs, turn you into unstoppable brawling machines that can easily defeat monkey, monster, and mountain. It’s perhaps Nintendo’s best-ever power trip.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/best-game-of-2025-clair-obscur-1765184681173.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s something undeniably nostalgic about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. Its turn-based battles, party-driven story, and linear exploration are distinctly old-school in nature, and undeniably indebted to the RPG greats of yesteryear. There’s perhaps no other game out there that wears its love for Final Fantasy as proudly as Expedition 33 does. But with its debut game, Sandfall Interactive has done more than pay homage to the past – it has demonstrated a scholarly understanding of why those games succeeded, and how their ideas can be revitalised. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Within the framework of a traditional, Japanese-style role-playing game, the young studio has created a distinctly modern take on the genre. Breathtaking combat encounters demand both split-second, real-time reactions and careful turn-by-turn tactical planning. Daunting bosses are overcome by smart (and sometimes enjoyably exploitative) use of a deep perks system that empowers you to transform your band of adventurers into a battalion of unstoppable heroes. And the archetypes used for each party member, from elegant fencers to destructive mages, are defined not just by weapons, but by bespoke battle mechanics that ensure each character feels like a distinct, unique personality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sandfall’s artistry is not limited to its impressive combat systems, though. Clair Obscur transports you to a breathtaking world where every sight and sound feels genuinely fresh. Its distinctly French, Belle Époque-influenced art style is unlike anything in the genre, as is its incredible music, composed by Lorien Testard, which is destined to play alongside Nobuo Uematsu’s best work in the video game concerts of the future. But it’s Expedition 33’s deeply affecting, emotionally resonating story – and the powerfully drawn characters who live and suffer through it – that leaves the greatest mark. In a world where a deity extinguishes swathes of ever-younger people on an annual basis, what does it mean to survive, grieve, and, ultimately, continue on? The answers to those questions changed not just Clair Obscur’s characters, but its players, too. This is without a doubt the year’s most talked-about game, and it comes as no surprise that it didn’t just win IGN’s end-of-year vote, but stole it by a landslide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is IGN’s Best Game of 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Congratulations to Sandfall Interactive, and also to all of the studios whose games were nominated and recognised as part of our end-of-year awards. Did we choose your favourites, or do you think we missed a worthy winner? Let us know in the comments, and be sure to check out our full list of awards to see who else we honored in our round-up of the very best of games, movies, TV shows, and more from across the year. But for now, we hope you had a brilliant time with the fantastic games of 2025, and we’ll catch you for even more in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-game-of-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Please picture this while playing Age of Imprisonment, and look forward to our new Zelda game."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Eiji Aonuma, the producer of The Legend of Zelda series, recently dropped some hints about what players can expect from the next game in the series in an interview with Japanese news site <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/898/G089833/20251205029/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4Gamer</a>. He noted that the collaboration with Koei Tecmo on Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment may influence the next mainline Legend of Zelda title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Wii got Twilight Princess and the Switch got Breath of the Wild as launch titles, there has yet to be any announcement about an upcoming mainline Zelda game for the Switch 2. However, owners of Nintendo’s latest console do have Hyrule Warriors: The Age of Imprisonment to play. Age of Imprisonment is the latest entry in a spin-off series that combines Dynasty Warriors-style 1 vs. 1000 <em>musou</em> gameplay with the characters, lore, and locales of The Legend of Zelda. It allows players to experience the Imprisoning War that sealed away the Demon King Ganondorf. Like previous Hyrule Warriors games, Age of Imprisonment was a collaboration between Koei Tecmo and Nintendo, with Koei Tecmo and its new AAA Games Studio handling the development.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelda series producer Aonuma said that his team wanted to be the first to release a new Zelda title on the Switch 2, however Koei Tecmo beat them to it. “The Legend of Zelda: Age of Imprisonment is the first Zelda title released for the Nintendo Switch 2. To be honest, we wanted to bring out the ‘first’ (Zelda game on the new console),” he laughed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Commenting on the collaboration with Koei Tecmo on Age of Imprisonment, Hidemaro Fujibayashi (director of Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild) said: “it was incredibly fun. They always had ideas we never would have come up with on our own, it was truly stimulating.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In turn, Age of Imprisonment’s director Koki Aoyanagi talked about how motivating it was to receive such positive reactions from the Nintendo team, saying: "since they (the Nintendo team) were playtesting the game, we wanted to give them big surprises and moments of awe to experience." Age of Imprisonment producer Ryota Matsushita described the Zelda team and Koei Tecmo’s team as being “on the same wavelength” when it came to collaborating on the game, noting that Fujibayashi’s knowledge of real-life castles enabled them to instantly understand each other regarding how Hyrule Castle should be depicted in Age of Imprisonment.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Legend of Zelda Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We aimed to combine these two approaches; the Zelda-like, strategic back-and-forth of using Zonai gear and varied techniques against powerful foes with the exhilaration of <em>musou </em>(i.e. feeling mighty powerful as you cut down waves of weaker foes),” noted AAA Games Studio head Yusuke Hayashi. Even when Nintendo’s Zelda team gave feedback on points of concern, Fujibayashi said that Koei Tecmo would come back with “proposals that elevated it into something even better.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aonuma even suggests that this fruitful collaboration might influence the next mainline Zelda title. “The inspiration we received from this collaboration with Koei Tecmo may be reflected in the (next) Zelda we create. Please picture this while playing Age of Imprisonment, and look forward to our Zelda.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aonuma’s comment is mysterious, but this means that we might get elements from Age of Imprisonment’s gameplay in the next mainline Zelda adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-moves-on-to-brand-new-the-legend-of-zelda-game-rules-out-tears-of-the-kingdom-dlc">Nintendo said it had no plans to release DLC for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and was instead moving on to a brand new game in the series</a>. However, Aonuma failed to rule out a return to the Hyrule of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, potentially setting up a third game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the first place, the reason I decided to make this a sequel to the previous work was because I thought there was value in experiencing a new game in that Hyrule place,” Aonuma said. “If that's the case, if a new reason arises, we might return to the same world again. Whether it's a sequel or a new work, I think it's going to be a completely new game, so I hope you're looking forward to it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Director Hidemaro Fujibayashi also chimed in with his own comment: “We are very grateful that so many customers have been playing Tears of the Kingdom for so long and deeply, so we will do our best to make the next game even more enjoyable.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

That's a pretty good showing, right? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're still looking to pick up the new game, it's down to <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxx8LY?object_uuid=9aac5ef4-52f1-4d92-9740-ce414355322a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$35 at Best Buy for one day only</a>, and around <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8YbG?object_uuid=9aac5ef4-52f1-4d92-9740-ce414355322a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$40 at most other retailers right now</a>.

Well, it doesn't take a genius to realize that Black Ops 7 doesn't seem to be doing as well as last year's Black Ops 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's reflected in everything from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">critical review scores</a> to fan response to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-suffers-terrible-launch-in-europe-with-63-fewer-copies-sold-than-battlefield-6-but-theres-important-context-to-consider">European sales figures</a>, and even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games">Activision's own admissions</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Normally, the newest Call of Duty topping the yearly charts is basically a given. This year, though, the surprise is that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-now-extremely-likely-to-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-as-the-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us">Battlefield 6 looks set to claim the top spot in the U.S. instead</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That is not entirely unprecedented. In 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-beats-modern-warfare-3-as-best-selling-game-of-2023-in-the-us">Hogwarts Legacy outsold Modern Warfare 3</a>, and it managed that without MW3 launching into Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Call of Duty bounced straight back in 2024, and before that only Rockstar heavyweights like GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 had managed to knock it off the annual top spot, stretching all the way back to Rock Band in 2008.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Viewed in that context, it is hardly shocking that Activision is reportedly rethinking how it plans and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games">releases Call of Duty year to year</a>, or that it is already leaning on aggressive discounts not long after one of its biggest games hit shelves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

But based on comments from developer Creative Assembly, it will eventually come to include pretty much every faction in the setting, added over the course of years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative Assembly announced Total War: Warhammer 40,000 at The Game Awards with a flashy trailer that combined CG and in-engine gameplay, showing off the scale of the hotly anticipated strategy game. We saw the Space Marines faction fighting against the Orks in a classic boots on the ground matchup, before the camera pulled back to reveal the galactic strategy layer you’ll be able to manage campaigns on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the Sega-owned developer, which is based in Horsham in the UK, has a grand plan to add many more factions to Total War: Warhammer 40,000 as part of a vision that may take a decade to realize.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war/blogs/92-total-war-thank-you-for-your-support-in-2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">year-ending thank you post</a> to the developer’s fans, Roger Collum, VP of Total War, said Creative Assembly’s goal is to create “the ultimate game set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe,” one that will see “all your favorites from the setting eventually coexist with a vast galactic sandbox.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Some of you have already pointed out that this is what the next 10 years looks like for CA,” Collum continued. “It’s going to take quite a bit of time to get everything in the massive 40k catalogue that deserves a place in the galaxy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s an exciting proposition of fans of Warhammer 40,000, which is packed with factions to choose from. Some of the more high-profile factions currently not announced to be in Total War: Warhammer 40,000 include the Necrons, the Tyranids, the Adeptus Mechanicus (tech-priests of Mars), and Chaos Space Marines (come on Death Guard!). But there are many more on top of those to consider, such as the Tau, Genestealer Cults, the Drukhari (Dark Eldar), and Adepta Sororitas (Sisters of Battle). The list goes on.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 doesn’t yet have a release date, so putting a year on when these factions may turn up in-game is impossible. But it sounds like Creative Assembly is here for the long run, as it has been with its Total War: Warhammer games, which began in 2016 and is still seeing updates for Total War: Warhammer 3. It stands to reason that Creative Assembly will look to employ a similar model for Total War: Warhammer 40,000, which means fans can reasonably expect most of the setting’s factions to get some time in the sun, perhaps via the release of Total War: Warhammer 40,000 2 and 3 (that’s a lot of numbers, though!).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are few Total War: Warhammer 40,000 details that have emerged in the wake of the game’s announcement worth pointing out here. In a follow-up developer roundtable video, Creative Assembly confirmed you’ll be able to blow up a planet in the game, although described this as a last resort. In-universe, this is called Exterminatus, and can only be done with the go-ahead from the highest authorities within the Imperium of Man. Sometimes, there really isn’t any other option in the grim darkness of the far future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the level of faction customization really does look impressive. Clearly, this isn’t a game about forcing players down the Ultramarines route, or any other Space Marine chapter for that matter. The hope is you’ll be able to not only realize that faction you’ve always dreamt about in aesthetic terms, but gameplay terms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
