            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> fans believe they've now worked out the truth behind recent teases that suggested something was going on with Rockstar's beloved cowboy franchise â€” but it's not what many fans had been hoping for. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, John Marston actor Rob Wiethoff teased that he had "exciting news" to share that was "absolutely killing" him to keep quiet, while chatting with fans during a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lbextu/i_wonder_what_this_could_mean" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">livestream</a>. Wiethoff suggested that, whatever the news was, fans would hear about it by the end of this week â€” and that he wouldn't be the only one sharing it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mystery deepened when Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan actor Roger Clark subsequently confirmed that he was also aware of the news, but couldn't yet say more. Immediately, fans began to speculate that the pair were involved in some kind of announcement regarding the future of the franchise, such as the reveal of an upgraded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> â€” something that has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-reportedly-set-for-nintendo-switch-2-by-end-of-2025-and-theres-a-rumored-next-gen-upgrade-patch-too">previously been reported as in development for Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With fan hopes at fever pitch, Wiethoff released a statement earlier this week clearly designed to manage expectations. In it, John Marston's voice actor said he "possibly misled some people" in regards to how exciting the announcement was, and said he did "not make announcements for Rockstar games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I do have something I'm really excited about, I truly am, and I think you will be too," Wiethoff said. "I really do think so, but I possibly misled some people when I announced that I have something to announce that I can't talk about right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Just please recognize â€“ and I know that you know this, but let me remind you, I guess â€“ I do not make announcements for Rockstar Games. We all know that, I'm just reminding you I do not make announcements for Rockstar Games. Rockstar Games makes announcements for Rockstar Games, and they don't use me to do that."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/cyberboiuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@cyberboiuk</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Mctannen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Mctannen</a> <br>Rob Wiethoff has clarified that his announcement has nothing to do with rockstar. <a href="https://t.co/WmlWJD1GSQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/WmlWJD1GSQ</a></p>â€” jonðŸš¬ (@jonbranham_) <a href="https://twitter.com/jonbranham_/status/1935043619754250697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">So what is the big mystery announcement? Well, fans have now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lg4jz3/was_this_the_announcement_rob_was_so_excited_for/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted</a> confirmation of a Red Dead Redemption and Red Dead Redemption 2 cast reunion, which is set to take place at the National Gaming Expo in Tampa, Florida from August 8 to August 10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Was this the announcement [Wiethoff] was so excited for?" wrote one fan on reddit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think so," added replied.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It would be great if they waited for this convention to reveal there's going to be SOME kind of update, remastering, DLC, a next chapter etc," said a third. "It's definitely wishful thinking on my part."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Dead Redemption 2 originally launched for PS4 and Xbox One back in October 2018, and arrived on PC a year later. Fans have long hoped for a revamped version designed to take advantage of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, but, more than five years after those consoles launched, a re-release or remaster is yet to arrive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Rockstar has been busy during this time building Grand Theft Auto 6, which after its recent delay will now launch on May 26, 2026. Surely there's time to pop out a Red Dead Redemption 2 patch before then?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

A large red biomass will keep spawning parasites that evolve when attacking players. If you let them get too close, you'll become infected and have to worry about your teammates taking you out. Depending on the parasite type, you'll either respawn or can fight researchers while infected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eliminating creatures and infected players will give you credits and level you up. This will help you unlock new weapons for taking on tougher creatures. But you can also use traps to wipe out hordes of parasites via decontamination or electricity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jeffrey Lerman is a freelance game journalist for IGN who has been covering games for over a decade.
