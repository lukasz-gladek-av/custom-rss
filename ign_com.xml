Patch notes reveal everything players can look forward to when they log in, including a selection of units inspired by characters from the One Punch Man anime, such as Tatsumaki, Sonic, Metal Bat, Boros, and, of course, Saitama himself. It breaks down to two Secret units, seven Mythical units, two Legendary units, and one Epic unit, but <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/16347800591/OPM-Anime-Royale" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anime Royale update 5</a>’s changes don’t stop there.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/31/anime-royale-one-punch-1738343679735.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">One Punch Man has come to Anime Royale players on Roblox.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A new Raid, Story, and Raid Shop, as well as new cosmetics, are also accessible to those who hop into the Roblox experience. The quality-of-life changes mostly focus on tweaking Meruem but also saved some room to deliver balance adjustments to Muzan and Aizen. Additionally, players will notice that the Killua blessing bug has been fixed, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anime Royale update 5 follows <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-royale-channels-hunter-x-hunter-with-update-45"><u>the release of update 4.5 last week</u></a>. That patch introduced Hunter x Hunter content for tower defense fans, including even more Mythical, Legendary, and Secret units. There is currently no release date for the next update, but at this rate, Roblox players likely won’t need to wait too long to learn more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, you can check out IGN’s full list of all active Anime Royale codes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-royale-codes"><u>here</u></a>.
