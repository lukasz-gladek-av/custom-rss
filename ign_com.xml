For more, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-2025-everything-announced">everything announced during Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb on Ninja Gaiden 2 Black:</p><blockquote>In Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, players assume the role of Ryu Hayabusa, a deadly ninja who wields the legendary Dragon Sword while embarking on a global battle against a series of formidable foes. The beautiful and bloody remaster utilizes Unreal Engine 5 to significantly enhance the graphic expression, elevating everything from character visuals to environmental backgrounds. In fact, the stages, characters, effects, and lighting have all been completely redesigned and remastered to fully immerse gamers into the story’s dark ninja world.</blockquote><blockquote>Gore elements such as dismemberment and blood have also been remastered to enhance the action experience. The high-speed, violent fights play out in brilliant brutality, utilizing a variety of weapons and techniques including Japanese swords, shurikens, Kusari-gamas, and tonfas. Meanwhile, those looking for a more toned-down experience can simply toggle the dismemberment feature on and off in the Options menu.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black includes extra elements from the spin-off titles released after the original game’s debut, including the ability to control three additional characters: Momiji, Ayane, and Rachel. The remaster also includes “HERO PLAY STYLE”, a mode for beginners that provides automatic support in the most difficult situations, making the notoriously challenging title more accessible for those who may not be so confident in their action skills.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/ninja-gaiden-4-developer-direct-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>, Team Ninja boss Fumihiko Yasuda explained the decision to remaster Ninja Gaiden 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This simultaneous announcement and same-day release alongside Ninja Gaiden 4 might have caught some people by surprise,” he said. “The biggest reason for developing Ninja Gaiden 2 Black was to address the concerns of core fans who might be wondering, ‘What’s going to happen to Ryu Hayabusa?’ We also wanted to give players something to enjoy as they wait for the release of Ninja Gaiden 4. We chose Ninja Gaiden 2 because it stands as one of the most solid action games in the series. We added ‘Black’ to the title to signal to fans that this is the definitive version, much like Ninja Gaiden Black was for the first game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yasuda continued: "This version is crafted to satisfy both those who played the original and newcomers discovering it as a current-generation action game. We’ve meticulously incorporated some of the additions of Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 while staying true to the challenge and feel of the original 360 version, including its signature gore and violence. We’ve also adjusted the weapon upgrade system to more align with the original release.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Ninja’s infamously challenging Ninja Gaiden series has a long association with Xbox. The developer’s reboot of the action series launched first on Xbox in 2004, propelling master ninja Ryu Hayabusa into the mainstream. Ninja Gaiden Black, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-ninja-gaiden-black-is-the-best-pure-action-game-of-all-time">considered one of the greatest action games of all time</a>, launched the following year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Gaiden 2 came out in 2008 published by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox 360. Ninja Gaiden 3 followed in 2012 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Since then, fans have had the critically panned spin-off Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z, and, more recently, Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection, a compilation of Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, and Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher Koei Tecmo revived interest in Ninja Gaiden with the announcement of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ninja-gaiden-ragebound">Ninja Gaiden Ragebound</a>, a brand-new side-scrolling spin-off due out later this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-sweeney-says-epic-can-afford-to-keep-spending-billions-fighting-apple-and-google-for-the-future-of-fortnite-on-mobile-for-decades-to-come<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic boss Tim Sweeney has spent quite a lot of money fighting Apple and Google over the way they run their app stores. How much? Billions of dollars. That, you’d think, would be unsustainable for most companies. But for Sweeney it’s an investment — a long term investment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sweeney’s ongoing battle to get Fortnite back on iPhones and Android phones while avoiding paying store fees is well-documented. The gist is this: Epic doesn’t want to pay the now standard 30% store fees on revenue made on mobile games. Instead, it wants to run the likes of Fortnite through its own mobile store, the Epic Games Store, without Apple and Google getting in the way and gobbling up its profit. Back in 2020, this dispute ended up with Fortnite blocked from release on iOS. In the U.S., nearly five years later, it is yet to return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After multiple costly legal battles Epic is making some progress, mostly in Europe due to the Digital Markets Act, but hardly in the U.S., where there isn’t even a whiff of a legislation that would support Epic’s cause. In August last year, the Epic Games Store launched on iPhones in the European Union and on Android devices worldwide with Fortnite, Rocket League Sideswipe, and Fall Guys for mobile. But actually getting the likes of Fortnite up and running on mobile is a nightmare, with various “scare screens” putting up to 50% of users off, according to Epic.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/23/gettyimages-1236597372-1-1737627928821.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Epic's Tim Sweeney is determined to defeat Apple and Google, however long it takes. Photo by SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Epic is taking the next step and launching third-party games on the Epic Games Store on mobile with the same 88/12 revenue share for payments it processes and 0% on third-party payments. Nearly 20 third-party games are now available on the Epic Games Store on mobile (19 new games on Android globally and 16 new games on iOS in the European Union). As part of a new free games program, Bloons TD 6 and Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee are free to download until February 20. To start, there will be new games offered each month until Epic moves to a weekly schedule later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this third-party mobile game push comes with a heavy financial cost. To encourage developers to release their games on the Epic Games Store, Epic is footing the bill for Apple’s controversial Core Technology Fee (CTF). The CTF, which Epic calls “illegal,” would otherwise make releasing video games on the Epic Games Store on iOS financially unviable, Epic said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Epic has found none of the top 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers are willing to make the jump to the Epic Games Store because of the CTF and Apple and Google’s "onerous restrictions and scare screens." Epic says it can’t pay the CTF for developers in the long term, but it’s willing to do so while the European Commission investigates what it calls Apple’s “non-compliance” with the law.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to outlets including IGN ahead of today’s announcement, Sweeney said Epic had invested over $1 billion in the Epic Games Store so far. Sweeney also said Epic has been spending more money than it’s making every year “because we choose to reinvest in growth.” And it’s pumping “the greater part” of $1 billion a year trying to expand its business into mobile — including its fight with Apple and Google.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the spending, Epic has suffered significant layoffs. In September 2023, the North Carolina studio saw 830 employees, or about 16% of its workforce, lose their jobs. In October last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-laying-off-830-employees-tim-sweeney-says-fortnite-maker-epic-is-now-financially-sound">Sweeney insisted the company was now “financially sound,”</a> with Fortnite and the Epic Games Store both hitting new records in “concurrency and success.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/23/unnamed-9-1737628997875.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">It's been nearly five years since Fortnite was blocked on iPhones in the U.S.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What is the endgame here? How long can Epic keep this huge spending up? Fortnite with its high-profile events and premium skins continues to bring in billions of dollars, and Epic of course has its lucrative Unreal Engine business fueling the video game industry. But for how much longer can Epic justify burning through billions in this seemingly endless fight?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN put that to Tim Sweeney, and here’s what he had to say in response:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, I think we might run into serious financial problems after a couple more decades of this. But we're determined to fight this out. I expect large parts of this struggle will go on throughout the rest of this decade and we're fully committed to going through it and investing to break through.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We're seeing this as an investment in Epic's future, both our future directly as a game developer ourselves, we see a much greater opportunity for Fortnite as a business if the market is open and competition is allowed on iOS, on an Android, and these big tech companies and their junk fees aren't crushing market entrances.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But we also see opportunity for all developers. And because we have businesses serving all developers, the Unreal Engine and the Epic Games Store, our online services, we see an opening up of the market as offering a real breakout opportunity for Epic as a game company and an ecosystem company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And if you look at Epic’s history, we've always aimed big and we've always grown prudently. Our first big 3D game in the era of Doom and Quake was the first Unreal game in 1998. And that sold two million copies. It was pretty cool! And we made Gears of War and expanded to console, and that sold six million copies. And we decided to become an online game developer, and it took years to figure out how to do that, with years without growth. But we figured it out eventually with Fortnite in 2017 and now we're a company with billions of dollars of revenue a year and thousands of employees and an opportunity of the sort that we've never had before. And I do not see this as last phase of Epic's growth and opportunity, if we're successful in what we're trying to do and building online gaming into a much bigger, more social and connected world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Some people call it the Metaverse and some people call it just games, but it is real. And you find hundreds of millions of players who are highly engaged in immersive 3D games together with their friends. And we think that if we are successful with this, then someday there will be billions of users of this kind of game. And we think we're in an awesome position to be a leading company or perhaps the leading company in that world if the shackles are removed that prevent us and all developers from actually competing on our own and becoming first class companies in the industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And if you back up and you look at the big tech landscape, not a single trillion dollar company anywhere in the world is a vassal in another company's ecosystem. You're either a company that has a direct relationship with customers and freedom to do business with them directly, or you're behind Apple and Google's paywall and you do not have that chance and you cannot grow and most of the profit your business produces will go to Apple and Google who will use it for fuck all… share buybacks and dividends rather than investment in hiring and innovating and building technology and making the world a better place.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Sweeney is essentially saying here is that Epic will keep fighting Apple and Google for decades to come if it has to, continuing to spend billions because it believes that if it wins, it will make many billions more in the long term. There is a huge amount of money at stake here, and Sweeney sounds determined to see it through. IGN has asked Apple for comment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/23/unnamed-12-1737629038010.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Even where it's available, the Epic Games Store is a nightmare to download on mobile. Epic calls these "scare screens."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s not just about how much money Epic has already spent, it’s about how much money it might have made had it bowed to Apple’s store fees, coughed up that 30%, and had Fortnite on iOS for the last five years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN asked Sweeney if Epic had calculated this missed opportunity, and here’s what he had to say:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, this is something we think about a lot and it's always hard to predict because there's just a direct number of users, percentage of users we had on iOS before and that could have continued, but we could have also potentially driven significant new forms of growth on mobile as new opportunities opened up in new markets where they were more mobile than PC and console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The fight against Apple and Google has certainly denied us a billion dollars of revenue, perhaps several billion, and we certainly could have been a higher revenue vassal to Cupertino had we stayed on the App Store and paid Apple's junk fees forever. But I felt very firmly that the proper way to challenge them was to demonstrate to the world the real effects of their policies because Apple... Apple does a good job of hiding it. They don't let developers tell users that they're paying 30% of their fee for nothing or their purchase price is going to Apple for nothing, and it's not widely known.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And so this was largely a supply side dispute between developers and the platform ecosystems. The moment Apple blocked Fortnite, it became about access and about denial of access to markets and about monopoly abuse to further the company's economic objectives. And the moment Apple banned Fortnite, the conversation in the world changed and everybody realized that these companies aren't just some part of the supply chain that takes a cut. They are the sole viable distribution vehicle for platforms reaching billions of users.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And around that time regulatory activity perked up and became serious and has come into force through a number of laws that have really begun to shake up the market. We view our company's aims on the scale of decades. We've been in business for 33 years now, which is a pretty long time for a tech company, especially a game developer. There were a lot of game developers in 1991, not many of them are around now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But we think our best days are ahead and we think our best days can only be achieved when we have true freedom and we believe the best way to get to that freedom is to go all in and fighting for access rather than arguing about money as Apple is trying to encourage all other developers to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And so I have no regrets and I think that in the long run, we'll look back at the event in August 13th, 2020 when we opened up Fortnite and supported direct payment and gave customers savings by purchasing directly and avoiding Apple junk fees, that whole series of events I think will be the thing that instigated the change that is absolutely necessary for the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Do you want your kids to grow up in a market where Apple and Google extract all the profit from all digital businesses and control access to all the information? It's not a good world, just like FYI. So no regrets, though it’s been terribly costly. We're really looking at our future opportunity and future value rather than the opportunity that we missed by fighting Apple and Google this way.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is this: Epic is working with regulators in the European Union to stop Apple and Google from allegedly breaking the law (it wants both to comply with the Digital Markets Act and enable proper access to the Epic Games Store and its games), and it plans to bring the Epic Games Store to iOS in the UK and Japan at the end of this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about the U.S.? When will Fortnite finally return to iPhone in the country? “Once policymakers and courts in other countries like Brazil, Australia, Korea and the United States make it possible, we’ll bring the Epic Games Store to iOS in those countries too,” Epic said. “We will keep fighting to break down barriers not just for the Epic Games Store, but for everyone.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Arda Kucukkaya/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The setting of feudal era Japan has been one of the dream locales that fans and even Ubisoft developers have had for the franchise's jaunt through humanity's secret history, and it's finally serving as the backdrop for the next entry. But Shadows has also been a game that has seen some notable delays to ensure the developers stick the landing. Simply put, there's a lot of anticipation for what's in store for Ubisoft's big return to a massive Assassin's Creed RPG.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After spending several hours playing Assassin's Creed Shadows, the next entry keeps up with the satisfying action and traversal that the series is known for, but it also showcases a sharper eye for worldbuilding, and giving its two protagonists their time in the spotlight. From my time sneaking through fortresses, taking in the sweeping vistas of the open world, and pulling off slick combat finishers, I got to see just how developer Ubisoft Quebec has improved its balancing act of satisfying action, RPG systems, and rewarding open-ended exploration in a captivating new setting that's been long overdue.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exclusive Concept Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Assassin's Creed Origins in 2017, the series has stayed comfortably within the realm of the open-world RPG, offering an expanded scope and narrative decisions to alter the course of the story. While this shift led to some growing pains for the series, it has gotten a better handle on the additional layers to gameplay without compromising the fantasy of being an ancient assassin. With Shadows, the latest attempt at an Assassin's Creed RPG shows that developer Ubisoft may have also cracked the code on the role-playing element with its two unique protagonists, something the series has struggled to present in a way that hasn't muddied the narrative waters.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ubisoft may have also cracked the code on the role-playing element with its two unique protagonists, something the series has struggled to present in a way that hasn't muddied the narrative waters.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking with creative director Jonathan Dumont, he stated that Assassin's Creed Shadows has an underlying theme about unity. Given the backdrop of Feudal Japan and its period of unification, the game focuses heavily on the bond between the two leads and their growth throughout the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For me, this game has a message about unity, and fighting for those who cannot, which is a responsibility that both of the characters have in the game," he said. "I think that it's about finding your place in that world, and I think both characters represent that and the importance of community and the importance of taking care of each other and going on this journey together through Japan in this period of unrest."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest game puts its sights on a new mystery deep within a revamped Animus program. In this new simulation, we focus on feudal era Japan and the secret history of both Yasuke, a historical African slave who became a full-fledged Samurai, and Naoe, a female Shinobi taking up the mantle of her father's legacy. The pair eventually team up to navigate a radically changing 1500s Japan, rubbing shoulders with other historical allies such as Oda Nobunaga and Kuroda Kanbei while taking down a shadowy cabal of warlords manipulating the country's attempt at unification from within.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I spent most of my playtime exploring Harima Province, one of the early zones that featured a questline involving an insidious plot to undermine the region's power structure. The world of Assassin's Creed Shadows is massive, but thankfully not to the ridiculous size of Valhalla. That said, plenty of opportunities were packed in this province, and the viewpoints to observe nearby points of interest helped point me in the right direction. A general theme I found compelling was how Shadows emphasized harmonizing with the open world – a cultural element the developers wanted to highlight with the Japanese setting.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This theme also extends to the side activities and how the world changes over time with shifting seasons that alter the terrain. Shadows ditches the need for hunting, and instead, you can find and draw rare wildlife found in the wild. It was an odd activity at first, but I found them endearing and a surprisingly wholesome change of pace. I soon found myself being taken in by how atmospheric and thoughtful the setting was. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows also emphasizes the dynamic between the two protagonists and their agency within the world after bonding over being outcasts within the country. I really enjoyed their dynamic within the story, and they play well with each other during cutscenes. Yasuke is a gentle giant and wise Samurai enforcer who offers some poignant insights while learning about Japanese culture. Naoe's growth into an assassin with a heavy legacy to uphold shows an early look at the dramatic highs of the main story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You're free to switch off characters in the open world and during moments in the main story, letting you play as who you want in most key missions. But in an interesting addition, you also have the option of playing in Canon Mode, which presents a defined story without major narrative choices – which was added after developers saw how many fans were debating what the definitive story was for Valhalla and Odyssey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yasuke and Naoe also represent the different extremes of Assassin's Creed's combat and stealth experiences, which have also seen clear upgrades across the board in Shadows. For combat, there's a heightened need for dodging and parrying strikes, crucial to piercing through armor to deliver a killing blow. It injects Ghost of Tsushima's offense and defensive style of swordplay, but it also has familiar AC combat skills such as power grabs and the always funny kick move I used plenty of times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The setting of Japan was a setting that the developers have wanted to make for some time, and according to game director Charles Benoit, they also saw an opportunity to have the series lean further into its stealth-action roots.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It also has familiar AC combat skills such as power grabs and the always funny kick move I used plenty of times.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you look at the brand in general, we had a lot of stealth focus in the first few games, and then with the RPG, we saw a rise more of a rise with combat in Origins, so I feel Shadows is mixing the whole era of Assassin's Creed and bringing about a return to stealth as a focus," he said. "But combat is still very much a core pillar for us, which is why we wanted two characters. With the Japan setting, we have the archetypes of the Samurai and Ninja, and that gives a great opportunity to develop both equally."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I generally felt pleased with the more thoughtful approach to combat. However, it also comes with more challenges, which unexpectedly made some of the encounters in the game feel a bit more difficult. The game also struggled to present fights with multiple foes accurately, and it can be easy to get overwhelmed by enemies coming in off-screen. Still, when the new combat in Shadows hits, it certainly does hit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What impressed me most with Shadows was the revamped stealth gameplay, which appropriately incorporates elements from Ubisoft's other stealth-action series, Splinter Cell. With the new visibility meter, you can see how open you are. Furthermore, there's a greater emphasis on light and darkness; you can even snuff out candles to add some cover. My favorite addition is the ability to go prone, which, as you can expect, is a game-changer for stealth. Playing stealth with Naoe was so satisfying, and it does well to showcase just how much that gameplay style has improved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While both characters can combat and stealth, they also have clear limitations. For instance, Yasuke is a formidable fighter and is capable of ambushing enemies, however his large stature is not ideal for advanced stealth. In addition to being incapable of climbing certain areas, he's also not so great at performing the leap of faith.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Naoe, she's a skilled assassin with access to a grappling hook and smoke bombs. However, Naoe's nimble combat style is far more reliant on parrying and dodging, and one hit from an elite enemy's heavy strike can take a chunk of her health bar. While pulling off Naoe's combat skills was satisfying, I often had to resist the urge to take out every enemy and run for it when things got out of hand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Continuing with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, you can manage and upgrade a base of operations. As you recruit allies, they'll head to your hideout to open up shops and offer new side missions that incentivize revisits to previous zones. But Shadows takes this feature a step further by allowing you to build out your custom village in the vein of Animal Crossing. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows - Art and Concept Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The town builder mode offers plenty of options to add necessities and some personal touches to the hideout. I spent an unexpected amount of time building more housing and decorating my space with Shinto shrines and pets – such as cats and tanuki. There are also side activities, such as a visually striking meditation mini-game, to help you earn additional perks. It's an unexpectedly cozy side activity for an AC game, and I was quickly taken in by how satisfying it was to walk around a massive village I had made in a reasonably short time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Assassin's Creed Shadows is shaping to be a solid follow-up to Ubisoft's ambitious Valhalla. Even if the familiar crop of open-world bugs and quirks popped up during my time, I still found a great deal to appreciate with Shadows and its worldbuilding. While this conceit is not an uncommon backup for video games – which can be easy to mess up with insensitive representation – Assassin's Creed Shadows so far does well to justify its take on an open-world RPG set during this culturally rich era, especially in its handling of the two protagonists. With the release coming soon, I'm eager to see how Ubisoft's take on Assassin's Creed's journey to Japan will come together.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The most recent was only by a month, which doesn't seem like much time to change anything significant. So why did Ubisoft push the game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the game director: roofs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At a recent preview event for Shadows, we spoke with game director Charles Benoit, who confirmed that the month delay was "mostly about polishing" and did not change any big systems. The team did update "a couple of things in progression to make it more engaging, also balancing a bit more." But the main feature that needed extra tweaking was the parkour system, which Benoit says was running up against an obstacle unique to Feudal Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Japanese architecture, the roofs [are] super complex," he said. "Probably the most complex thing that I ever worked with if we compared to Odyssey and Syndicate. We needed specific codes and specific animations to support something super fluid, changing the transition of the parkour to make it even more fluid. So that's one of the specific feedback that we heard that we wanted to address, and it really improved since the last few months."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed: Animus Hub Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin's Creed Shadow was originally planned for release in November 2024, but was pushed to February 2025 and then again to March, with the company citing player feedback as a main reason for the delay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-the-final-preview">our recent preview of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.
