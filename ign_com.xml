It’s a list of 26 titles that <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/news/silent_hill_4_fear_and_more_joining_the_gog_preservation_program" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GOG says</u></a> will “remain playable in their best versions” that players can safely assume they’ll have access to for years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill 4: The Room is one title that will benefit from the GOG Preservation Program in more ways than one. In addition to securing its future, GOG says the entry’s status with the service means it comes with “missing content that was never available on PC before.” This includes the reintroduction of Hauntings, which spruce up that iconic Silent Hill atmosphere with spooky effects, such as flickering lamps and possessed telephones. Modern controller support has also been added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">F.E.A.R.

Honestly, I was betting on summer at best, but here we are with actual product showing up on Amazon and not behind some sketchy paywalled Discord server. While the internet’s currently losing its mind over Prismatic Evolutions and burning money chasing stock alerts for Rival Destinies, the smart play is scooping up the older sets that just hit Amazon Global. We’re talking Scarlet and Violet era stuff, Sword and Shield throwbacks, and boxes that were basically extinct six months ago.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article"> Amazon International Solves Pokémon TCG Shortage With Massive Restocks</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the kind of flood the TCG community needed. Not just for collectors trying to complete sets, but for anyone who’s tired of battling bots for ETBs like it’s the Hunger Games. There’s a real mix available right now: Booster Bundles, Premium Collections, tins with actual storage value. And yes, even a few deals that make it feel like Amazon’s trying to keep the vibe positive. If you’re chasing big pulls like Greninja SIR or Pikachu ex SIR, or just need to stock up on sleeves and dice, this is the best stock refreshes we’ve seen in a while.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Sony WH-1000XM5 Noise Cancelling Headphones for $225</h2><div catalogid="36a3b9f5-2ced-42c2-8fd0-f4fa3b4e7cdd" id="215541"><p data-cy="paragraph">AliExpress is currently offering the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoXdnv?object_uuid=4bfe7cc4-dd34-49ec-8fe7-cc48f6258d51&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphones</a> for only $225.18 after coupon code: <strong>IFP7FJZ </strong>is applied during checkout.

AliExpress makes up for it with a 15-day free return policy and guarantees a refund if your order doesn't arrive within 20 days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our glowing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">Sony WH1000XM5 review</a>, Kevin Lee wrote that "The Sony WH-1000XM5 is hands down the best sounding and most impressive noise-canceling headphones around.

Seeing it available without a 200% markup or sketchy third-party seller feels borderline miraculous. You’re getting nine booster packs, a full-art Teal Mask Ogerpon promo, and all the usual ETB goodies like energy cards, condition markers, and themed sleeves.</p></div><p id="pokemon-sword-and-shield-brilliant-s"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon Sword and Shield Brilliant S">Pokemon Sword and Shield Brilliant Stars Build and Battle Box</h2></p><div catalogid="5af74e62-4a2a-42ce-908f-201f35801727" id="217162"><div id="217162" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon Sword and Shield Brilliant Stars Build and Battle Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not every day you see <em>Brilliant Stars</em> Build and Battle Boxes in stock, let alone without having to navigate the wild west of resale sites. At $63.34, this one comes with four booster packs and a pre-release promo card, which makes it a solid pickup for collectors looking to flesh out their Sword and Shield era sets. Arceus VSTAR headlines the expansion, and the pull potential here still holds up.</p></div><p id="among-us-4-pack-steam"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Among Us 4-Pack (Steam) ">Among Us 4-Pack (Steam) </h2></p><div catalogid="a1764be7-7576-4ba9-b44e-c6dd9cb0f16c" id="217179"><div id="217179" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Among Us 4-Pack (Steam) </h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Among Us 4-Pack on Steam is a sneaky little deal that gives you four copies of the game for the price of one, making it dangerously easy to rope your friends into a night of trust issues and vent-related betrayal. It supports cross-platform play, customizable settings, and chaotic emergency meetings that usually end with the wrong person getting ejected. If you’ve somehow missed the social deduction chaos, now’s the perfect time to catch up and take three crewmates down with you.</p></div><p id="pokemon-tcg-hisuian-electrode-v-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG: Hisuian Electrode V Box">Pokemon TCG: Hisuian Electrode V Box</h2></p><div catalogid="5af74e62-4a2a-42ce-908f-201f35801727" id="217166"><div id="217166" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG: Hisuian Electrode V Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <em>Hisuian Electrode V Box</em> is back in stock at Amazon for $42.45, which is a win considering how sporadically these pop up. It's one of those V boxes that slipped under the radar when it first launched, but now that Sword and Shield-era product is drying up it’s worth grabbing. You get a foil Hisuian Electrode V promo, a regular Electrode foil, an oversized version (because why not), and four booster packs to rip through.</p></div><p id="ign-x-assassins-creed-shadows-snack"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="IGN x Assassin’s Creed Shadows Snack">IGN x Assassin’s Creed Shadows Snack Box</h2></p><div catalogid="a1764be7-7576-4ba9-b44e-c6dd9cb0f16c" id="217180"><div id="217180" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>IGN x Assassin’s Creed Shadows Snack Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This limited-edition snack box is a flavor-packed tribute to <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, blending premium Japanese treats with collectible game merch in a way that feels like an edible side quest. You get 15 unique snacks, a full bag of exclusive Kit Kats, a custom Tenugui towel, and even an in-game item called The Hourglass that’s only available through this box. With artwork prints, a detailed snack guide, and a box sleeve that transforms into a display-worthy poster, it’s more than just snacks.</p></div><p id="pokemon-tcg-shining-fates-collectio"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG: Shining Fates Collectio">Pokemon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h2></p><div catalogid="5af74e62-4a2a-42ce-908f-201f35801727" id="217175"><div id="217175" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Seeing the <em>Shining Fates</em> Pikachu V Box on Amazon again feels like spotting a shiny in the wild. At $49.96 it’s not exactly a steal, but having it in stock is the real value. This box comes with a foil Pikachu V promo, an oversized version for flair, and four Shining Fates booster packs. That means a legit shot at pulls from one of the most hype-filled sets of the Sword and Shield era.</p></div><p id="pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-surg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surg">Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="5af74e62-4a2a-42ce-908f-201f35801727" id="217174"><div id="217174" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <em>Surging Sparks</em> Booster Bundle is actually in stock at Amazon for $47.95, which is kind of a miracle considering how fast this set’s been disappearing. You get six booster packs from the newest Scarlet and Violet expansion, which includes some major chase cards like Pikachu ex SIR and Latias ex. If you missed the chaos of launch day or couldn’t snag a bundle without battling bots, this is your chance to catch up.</p></div><p id="samsung-49-inch-odyssey-g9-g95sd"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="SAMSUNG 49-Inch Odyssey G9 (G95SD)">Samsung 49-Inch Odyssey G9 (G95SD)</h2></p><div catalogid="a1764be7-7576-4ba9-b44e-c6dd9cb0f16c" id="217056"><div id="217056" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>SAMSUNG 49-Inch Odyssey G9 (G95SD)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I want this monitor for the simple reason that it looks like it belongs in Tony Stark’s lab. A 49-inch, ultra-wide, QD-OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate? If my setup had this, I’d never leave my chair. The colors are unreal, the response time is basically instant (0.03ms is comically fast), and the glare-free tech means I won’t see my own reflection mid-boss fight. At $500 off, it’s still expensive, but honestly, it’s worth it if you want peak immersion.</p></div><p id="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-cell-phone"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Cell Phone ">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Cell Phone 256GB</h2></p><div catalogid="a1764be7-7576-4ba9-b44e-c6dd9cb0f16c" id="217059"><div id="217059" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Cell Phone 256GB</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This phone is basically a camera with a built-in smartphone. The 200MP camera can zoom in on the moon and still make it look good. Samsung threw in AI-powered features like Circle to Search, which lets you instantly Google anything on your screen without typing. Oh, and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is ridiculously fast. If you want a phone that does everything (and does it well), this is the one.</p></div><p id="samsung-electronics-870-evo-2tb-25"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Samsung Electronics 870 EVO 2TB 2.5 ">Samsung Electronics 870 EVO 2TB 2.5 Inch SATA III Internal SSD</h2></p><div catalogid="a1764be7-7576-4ba9-b44e-c6dd9cb0f16c" id="217060"><div id="217060" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Samsung Electronics 870 EVO 2TB 2.5 Inch SATA III Internal SSD</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I can’t think of a reason <em>not</em> to buy this SSD. It’s fast, reliable, and at 2TB, it has enough space to store my digital hoarding problem. Samsung’s 870 EVO series has been around forever, and there’s a reason people swear by it.

The AI storyteller keeps things unpredictable, which is just a fancy way of saying everything will go horribly wrong in the most entertaining way possible. If you like deep, strategy-driven games with absurdly detailed mechanics, this one’s worth every penny.</p></div><p id="samsung-t7-shield-2tb-portable-ssd"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" SAMSUNG T7 Shield 2TB, Portable SSD"> SAMSUNG T7 Shield 2TB, Portable SSD</h2></p><div catalogid="a1764be7-7576-4ba9-b44e-c6dd9cb0f16c" id="217061"><div id="217061" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> SAMSUNG T7 Shield 2TB, Portable SSD</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This SSD is built like a tank. It’s water-resistant, dustproof, and can survive drops from nearly 10 feet (which is great because I drop everything). With read speeds up to 1,050MB/s, it’s fast enough for gaming, video editing, or transferring <em>way too many</em> photos. If you need external storage that won’t fail you, this is a solid choice.</p></div><p id="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-ai-cell-phon"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phon">SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB </h2></p><div catalogid="a1764be7-7576-4ba9-b44e-c6dd9cb0f16c" id="217058"><div id="217058" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Flip 6 AI Cell Phone, 512GB </h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I never thought I’d be nostalgic for flip phones, yet here I am, fully on board with the Z Flip 6. It’s like Samsung took the 2000s and gave it a glow-up. FlexCam lets you take hands-free selfies (because holding a phone is apparently outdated now), and the AI-powered photo editing actually fixes my questionable photography skills. It folds, it’s futuristic, and at $272 off, it’s almost a steal. Almost.</p></div><p id="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-5g-124-256"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab S10+ 5G 12.4” 256">SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab S10+ 5G 12.4” 256GB</h2></p><div catalogid="a1764be7-7576-4ba9-b44e-c6dd9cb0f16c" id="217057"><div id="217057" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab S10+ 5G 12.4” 256GB</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think Samsung made this tablet for people who want to replace their laptop but still pretend they aren’t using a laptop. The 12.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen is bright, crisp, and basically perfect for binge-watching or note-taking (because productivity, right?). The 5G connectivity means you can work (stream Netflix) literally anywhere. It even comes with an S Pen, so you can doodle, take notes, or pretend you’re signing important contracts.</p></div><p id="apple-airpods-pro-2-anc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods Pro 2 ANC">Apple AirPods Pro 2 ANC</h2></p><div catalogid="a1764be7-7576-4ba9-b44e-c6dd9cb0f16c" id="216986"><div id="216986" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro 2 ANC</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Apple’s best earbuds are now $50 off.
