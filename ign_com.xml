            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">1047 Games has some thoughts regarding how <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/splitgate-arena-reloaded"><u>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</u></a> is faring on Steam, and it’s got a message for fans: “Steam Charts don’t measure fun.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Halo and Portal-inspired FPS re-launched December 17 for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S after the studio chose to U-turn with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-will-go-back-to-beta-to-undergo-a-massive-rework-amid-more-layoffs-and-splitgate-1-shutdown"><u>an overall rework for Splitgate 2</u></a> back in July 2025. It was a move made amid layoffs at 1047 that saw both the sequel and its popular predecessor pulled offline as the studio promised to return with “big, sweeping changes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those changes seemingly failed to attract players, with just around 2,300 players logging in to play the free-to-play game on Steam at launch and a little more than 800 playing at the time of this piece’s publication (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#max" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB</u></a>). The Splitgate community quickly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1q21pye/splitgate_has_fumbled_again_and_failed_to_secure/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>drummed up debate</u></a> about what another disappointing launch could mean for the future of the shooter, but 1047 has <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a different take</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">1047 Games Responds to Recent Steam Charts Conversations <a href="https://t.co/ir9W0BjFHo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ir9W0BjFHo</a></p>— SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 6, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Steam Charts don’t measure fun,” a message from the team says. “They show one number, on one platform, at one given moment. They don’t show the full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don’t capture the community that’s actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming (including upcoming content like Arena Royale).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to separate Splitgate: Arena Reloaded’s launch player numbers from the nearly 26,000 users who showed up for Splitgate 2, but 1047’s targeted response does aim to remind players that the re-launch also came to consoles and the Epic Games Store. Metrics for those platforms aren’t as openly available as they are for Steam, so it’s unclear if interest is similarly quiet elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, the studio wants both veteran and potential players to know it’s put work into getting Splitgate: Arena Reloaded ready for launch, and it doesn’t plan on slowing down anytime soon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“To our amazing community: thank you,” 1047 continues. “Your feedback and passion have helped make Arena Reloaded better every day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And to everyone who hasn’t played yet: Arena Reloaded is free, the gameplay’s the best it’s ever been, and we’d love for you to jump in and form your own opinion. A lot of passionate people worked very hard on it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As 1047 takes to social media to combat the negative sentiment surrounding its re-launch effort, its Arena Royale component is expected to launch in the near future. Splitgate: Arena Reloaded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-relaunches-this-month-as-splitgate-arena-reloaded"><u>came with</u></a> a rebuilt progression system, new and reworked maps, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering sealed product is making waves at big box retailers and TCGPlayer, but who has the best prices this week? Well, both Amazon and secondary marketplace TCGPlayer have their bargains, so I’ve noted the best deals down to save you looking, as well as the other best deals of the day.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alienware has just dropped a massive discount on their NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 build, coupled with one of the best gaming processors on the market right now in AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Looking for a cheap and cheerful deal instead? How about two 6.6ft braided USB-C cables that can handle up to 240W for the price of a coffee? Thought so. Coming in at the product you didn't know you needed today is a cordless air duster for easy cleaning of desks, PCs, fans and more that's currently half off from $39.98. Let's get into it:</p><p id="mtg-cheapest-at-amazon"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG: Cheapest at Amazon">MTG: Cheapest at Amazon</h2></p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>Amazon is putting out some decent pricing, with my favorite pick here being the "Game Edition" of Cloud Strife-themed Limit Break Commander Deck. It's around the same price as TCGPlayer, making it market value, with the artwork being based on in-game moments instead of the traditional MTG artwork.</p><p>The same can be said for the Marvel's Spider-Man Play Booster Box containing 30 booster packs with the following:<br>• 14 Magic: The Gathering cards<br>• 1–4 cards of rarity Rare or higher<br>• 3–6 Uncommon cards<br>• 6–9 Common cards<br>• 1 Land card (Traditional Foil Land replaces a Land in 20% of boosters)<br>• 1 card of any rarity is Traditional Foil; Foil Showcase Mythic Rare in 1% of boosters</p></div><p id="mtg-cheapest-at-tcgplayer"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG: Cheapest at TCGPlayer">MTG: Cheapest at TCGPlayer</h2></p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>Meanwhile, TCGPlayer is the place to go for MTG preorders. It's the cheapest for the Lorwyn Eclipsed Play Booster Box and Bundle, with the next Universes Beyond entry Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Play Booster Box, Turtle Power! Commander Deck and Bundle, the latter being over $15 cheaper than Amazon.</p><p>There's some gorgeous Final Fantasy scene boxes coming in cheaper than Amazon too, not to mention the standard Limit Break Commander Deck being just under $5 cheaper on TCGPlayer. It pays to shop around for sure.</p></div><p id="alienware-area-51-rtx-5090"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Alienware Area-51 RTX 5090">Alienware Area-51 RTX 5090</h2></p><div catalogid="eab3ddf4-df4e-4312-bd6d-0ff777612420" id="234132"><div id="234132" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, 32GB DDR5 RAM, 1TB M.2 SSD</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alienware Area-51 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 32GB GDDR7</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This beast is loaded with an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU, GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card, 32GB DDR5-6400MHz RAM, and a 1TB SSD. That alone sells this system with the custom cooling that makes Alienware's Area-51 builds worth the premium. The good news is we're seeing a rare discount on something that has an RTX 5090 in it, a solid 10%, or $550 off, knocking this build down to $5,049.99. What's not to love?</p></div><p id="2-pack-lisen-66ft-240w-usb-type-c-c"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="2-Pack Lisen 6.6ft 240W USB Type-C C">2 Lisen 6.6ft 240W USB Type-C Cables</h2></p><div catalogid="eab3ddf4-df4e-4312-bd6d-0ff777612420" id="234131"><div id="234131" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>2-Pack Lisen 6.6ft 240W USB Type-C Cables</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to my kids destroying countless USB cables over the years, I know what makes a USB-C charging cable that lasts. Braided wins out over rubber cable every day of the week due to its flexibility and durability. Thick caps on either side protecting the port will also be a lifesaver, but getting 240W-capable cables can sometimes cost a fortune.<br>Not today! You can get Lisen’s 6.6ft double pack for a ridiculously reasonable $5.60. These will handle fast charging for pretty much everything you can think of, from a mobile phone or Switch 2 to a MacBook. Even if you don't need a new cable, it's worth buying spares when deals like this crop up.</p></div><p id="jvscam-cordless-electric-air-duster"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="JVSCAM Cordless Electric Air Duster">JVSCAM Cordless Electric Air Duster</h2></p><div catalogid="eab3ddf4-df4e-4312-bd6d-0ff777612420" id="234133"><div id="234133" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>JVSCAM 130,000RPM Cordless Electric Air Duster with Adjustable Tips</h3></p></div><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>Cleaning dust or crumbs out of your keyboard is a pain. No-one likes doing it and it takes ages to brush them all out. I was in the "Why the hell do I need an electric duster" camp, but then I bought one and I’m using it quite a lot.</p><p>I use mine to clear out vents, fans, GPU and more inside my PC, and even use it to get to hard-to-reach places in the car and on my desk. They're very handy to have in your desk drawer and it’s a great deal for $20.</p></div></div><p id="market-value-at-amazon"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Market Value at Amazon">Pokémon TCG: Market Value at Amazon</h2></p><div><div id="234070" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At Market Value at Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><div id="234078" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At Market Value at Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cynthia’s Garchomp ex Premium Collection</h3></p></div><div id="234085" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Q4 Poke Ball Tins</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, the good news is you can get the Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box with Prime delivery without getting stung. It has nine booster packs, a gorgeous Charcadet Illustration Rare promo, Mega Charizard X–themed sleeves, card dividers, a tournament-legal coin, alongside some nice-looking dice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cynthia’s Garchomp ex Premium Collection has four Journey Together and two Destined Rivals booster packs, so if Trainer Pokémon cards are your thing, you’re good to go.</p><p id="cheapest-at-tcgplayer"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Cheapest at TCGPlayer">Pokémon TCG: Cheapest at TCGPlayer</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If it were me making a choice from the TCGPlayer selection here, I’d go for the Destined Rivals Booster Bundle. It’s $13 cheaper than Amazon right now and works out at $4.66 per booster pack, which is one of the best prices I’ve seen for Destined Rivals booster packs recently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want a decent Mega ex card for your Grass-type deck, I’d recommend the Mega Venusaur ex Premium Collection. If you run Meganium alongside it from Mega Evolution, you can double your Grass Energy value while being able to move a Grass Energy from one Pokémon to another thanks to their abilities. That means you can set up and use Mega Venusaur ex’s “Jungle Dump” attack for 240 damage in one turn (it costs four Grass Energy).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll also get the following booster packs:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2 × Mega Evolution</li><li>2 × Destined Rivals</li><li>4 × Journey Together</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
