The Iconic Kim Kardashian skin features her in skin-tight attire with alterable colors, necklines and hairstyles. The regular Kim Kardashian skin, meanwhile, comes with a jacket you can toggle on and off. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/11/1-1765459423442.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite's Iconic Kim Kardashian skin.
