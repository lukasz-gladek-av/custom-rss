Further technical enhancements for the PS5 Pro are also in development, the developer said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Stalker 2 launched in November 2024 to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-launches-big-on-steam-as-dev-promises-fixes-for-rough-edges"><u>a positive reception on Steam</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-already-sold-1-million-copies-with-many-more-playing-on-xbox-game-pass"><u>1 million sales</u></a>. It’s a success story for the Ukrainian studio; a miracle, really, considering the harrowing circumstances that followed Russian’s full-scale invasion of the country in 2022.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Stalker 2 launched with well-documented bugs and issues, chief among them A-Life 2.0. A-Life was a key feature of the first Stalker game that governed AI behavior across the game world. At a high level, it is a system for simulating life in the Zone that works its magic seemingly independently of the player’s actions or whereabouts. It helps to create convincing AI and the emergent gameplay Stalker is famous for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GSC had said A-Life 2.0 would make the Zone feel alive as never before, that it would fuel emergent gameplay on a scale previously thought impossible. Indeed for some fans, A-Life 2.0 was Stalker 2’s biggest selling point. But when Stalker 2 actually came out players discovered that A-Life 2.0 didn’t work properly, with some questioning whether it was even in the game at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN in December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam"><u>GSC explained what went wrong with Stalker 2’s A-Life 2.0</u></a>, and vowed to fix the system. They've been working on doing that ever since, and the expectation is that the PS5 version will include all the latest updates and fixes the developer has released for the PC and Xbox versions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Read more on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/following-stalker-2s-success-developer-gsc-game-world-contends-with-this-new-reality"><u>how Stalker 2 has changed everything for the studio here</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

"Players peaked in the week of May 25 and then started to fall back a bit. There was another bump in mid- to late- June as the game was put into various sales and things as well but that's a story for two weeks from now."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, meanwhile, debuted at the top of the charts for May, and became the 11th best-selling game of 2025 so far, topping the PlayStation, Xbox, and PC storefronts. When we asked Piscatella for comment, he noted that Elden Ring: Nightreign and the original Elden Ring weren't really comparable sales-wise, due to being very different games sold at very different prices. "That being said, Nightreign launch unit sales did not reach the same neighborhood as those of Elden Ring."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was followed closely by debut game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> at No. 2, which is also now the 16th best-selling game of 2025. As with Nightreign, The Dark Ages didn't hit the sales heights of its predecessor, Doom: Eternal, but according to Piscatella, "this is more timing than anything. Doom Eternal launched in March 2020... and nothing is going to ever comp well to any new game that launched in March of 2020."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New games F1 25 and Capcom Fighting Collection 2 debuted at No. 15 and No. 19, respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, spending on video game content was up 2% year-over-year to $3.7 billion, largely driven by subscription spending on non-mobile platforms, according to analysis by Circana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hardware spending dropped by 13% year-over-year in May, to $172 million, with Nintendo Switch dollar sales dropping 44%, Xbox Series dropping 30%, and PlayStation growing 3%. The PlayStation 5 was the best-selling hardware in both unit sales and dollars. Next month's charts for June will show the impact of the Nintendo Switch 2's release on this landscape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, video game spending was up 1% year-over-year to $4.1 billion.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">May 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Elden Ring: Nightreign (NEW)</li><li>Doom: The Dark Ages (NEW)</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>MLB: The Show 25*</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>NBA 2K25</li><li>EA Sports FC 25</li><li>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</li><li>Star Wars: Battlefront II</li><li>Split Fiction</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>F1 25 (NEW)</li><li>Helldivers II</li><li>The Last of Us: Part II</li><li>WWE 2K25</li><li>Capcom Fighting Collection 2 (NEW)</li><li>PGA Tour 2K25</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Continuing development is not sustainable..."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The live service bloodbath continues — this time the casualty is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/steel-hunters">Steel Hunters</a>, the mech shooter game from the people behind World of Tanks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Steel Hunters launched on April 2 in early access form on Steam. Some had hoped for Titanfall vibes from this free-to-play, PvPvE shooter, but it fell completely flat. And just three months later, developer Wargaming has announced plans to sunset the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post addressing Steel Hunter’s community, Wargaming said the game’s servers will live on for another three months before the game goes dark permanently from October 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Today we share difficult news: we've made the decision to sunset Steel Hunters,” Wargaming’s statement began. “You've given us so much passion and support but unfortunately we've come to the conclusion that continuing development is not sustainable. We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear and we genuinely share in your disappointment.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what went wrong? Amid the difficulties so many live service games have endured in recent times,  Steel Hunters failed to capture an audience. It launched on Steam with a peak of 4,479 concurrent players and a ‘mixed’ user review rating, and it was downhill from there. At the time of this article’s publication, the 24-hour peak was 97, with just 52 concurrent players — that’s devastating for any free-to-play game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/rakura/recommended/1691340/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top user review on Steam</a>, from a player with over 300 hours on Steel Hunters including its various pre-launch forms, lamented the potential of the game, and praised its mech design and maps. However, they critisized Wargaming's lack of a roadmap, slow pace of updates, and various bugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Early access should have never happened," they said. "We should have never left beta. Time and time again the players have been vocal about changes or fixes that were needed and have come to the table with very helpful solutions only to be met with 'we are moving forward' only to then react with 'why did it go south?'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Live service video games are enduring a tough time right now, with a number of titles falling by the wayside or finding themselves canceled before launch. Sony’s Concord is perhaps the highest-profile example of that, a PlayStation disaster that cost the gaming business hundreds of millions of dollars. But only last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-unannounced-mmo-was-doing-well-and-even-scaling-up-as-xbox-cancelation-blindsided-staff-sources-say">Microsoft canceled an unannounced MMORPG from the developer of The Elder Scrolls Online</a>, resulting in hundreds of layoffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
