Their three-minute video showcases not only what a successful run looks like but also the hellish tasks that await inside it. Split Ficition‚Äôs Laser Hell level is a gauntlet of demanding platforming challenges that see players dodging up and around a series of laser rooms, but it is doable ‚Äî and there‚Äôs a special video for those who see it through to the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As demonstrated in E1uM4y and Sharkov‚Äôs video, reaching the end of Split Fiction‚Äôs hardest level rewards Mio and Zoe with a clip recorded by Hazelight‚Äôs own Josef Fares. After opening the video with applause, he says he‚Äôs ‚Äúsuper amazed‚Äù by anyone who was able to beat the level while joking that his praise isn‚Äôt for ‚Äúyou guys who are looking (at) this on YouTube.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWow. Amazing. You have to understand, this challenge, there are barely people on our team that can make it,‚Äù Fares says in the video. ‚ÄúIt took us a lot of time to finish it. I‚Äôm telling you; this is a crazy, crazy achievement you have done.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs a feat worth celebrating indeed, but wait, there‚Äôs more! Fares promises that the first pair of players who manage to beat Split Fiction‚Äôs Laser Hell level and confirm their success will be flown out to Hazelight in Sweden for an early look at the studio‚Äôs next game along with a few ‚Äúother surprises.‚Äù It‚Äôs a promise that the director personally followed up on and confirmed in <a href="https://x.com/josef_fares/status/1902355744751514068" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on X/Twitter</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Congrats to ‚ÄùsharkOvO‚Äù and ‚ÄùE1uM4y‚Äù for finishing the secret challenge ‚ÄùLaser Hell‚Äù in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/splitficton?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#splitficton</a>. VERY impressive! I will keep my promise and invite you both to Sweden for an early look of our next gameüòé</p><p>We¬¥ll be in touch!</p></div>‚Äî Josef Fares (@josef_fares) <a href="https://twitter.com/josef_fares/status/1902355744751514068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">If you and a friend (for some reason) feel like taking a shot at Laser Hell yourselves, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzoFGqJmSxI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTuber ItzBytez uploaded a solid look at the whole level</u></a> from front to back, including the puzzle that needs to be solved to even access it. All you need to do is input a binary code listed under a Skotos label at the location shown, have your partner stand beside you, and you‚Äôll be taken down to a room where you‚Äôll surely spend countless attempts trying to see Fares‚Äô video in person.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what exactly Hazelight will be showing E1uM4y and Sharkov, those details remain a mystery. Fares recently shared that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-dev-calls-ea-a-good-partner-as-hazelight-begins-work-on-next-game"><u>the studio has been working on its next project for around a month</u></a> but declined to spill much in terms of its story, name, or release plans. We do know, at least, that the Hazelight team is ‚Äúvery excited‚Äù about it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Split Fiction launched earlier this month for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S and quickly became yet another co-op success for the studio. After securing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-sells-one-million-copies-in-48-hours"><u>1 million sales in just 48 hours</u></a>, Mio and Zoe‚Äôs story pulled a total of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-hits-2-million-sales-after-just-1-week"><u>2 million in just one week</u></a>. We‚Äôve yet to hear any more information about sales stats, but it sounds like Hazelight is very happy with how Split Fiction has performed so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

And considering all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">board game adaptations of video games</a> that now exist, it was no surprise when Cyberpunk eventually made its tabletop debut.

It's a wise choice: rather than trying the awkward task of fitting a digital, real-time experience into the tabletop world, upping the scale lets Gangs of Night City play to the strengths of a board game, with well considered tactical and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategic</a> options at your disposal. Yet the game still manages to re-create the rich setting of the video game on your table, both mechanically and aesthetically. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your tools in your bid to corner the dystopia underworld are three different unit types and a fun action selection system. Once used, your each action type needs to be refreshed before you can take it again, presenting players with difficult desicions around order and timing. Many actions involve units on the board: Solos are combat figures that secure territory, Techies can supplement your combat forces while also completing missions there to gain points, while Netrunners compete in a taut risk versus reward minigame for bonuses. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Board Game Deals</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The beauty of this system is the way these subsystems dovetail neatly to give you a wide strategic space to explore. Each unit type spearheads an overall approach you can specialize in, or you can mix and match to try and gain an edge. The game is interactive and dynamic and you'll need to read the situation and tailor your tactics accordingly in the tussle for area control. To top it off, there are fine production values to enjoy, with detailed miniatures and a suitably neon-spangled board depicting Night City. And if you get the bug for the game there's a range of expansion content to add in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-board-game-review">Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City board game review</a>.
