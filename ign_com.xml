            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In recent years, Square Enix has made quite an effort to remaster or remake some of its most beloved games and bring them to modern platforms. We've seen the incredible <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>, SaGa Frontier 2 Remastered, and Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles in 2025 alone!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, one game that continues to be left out of that conversation is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</a>, which released alongside the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-gifts-2025">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in June. If you're a recent Switch 2 owner and are looking for a new RPG to play, look no further than the fantastic game that is Bravely Default.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster for $29.99</h2><div catalogid="681de1aa-cde5-4374-8e89-64521fd58645" id="233911"><div id="233911" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>BRAVELY DEFAULT FLYING FAIRY HD Remaster</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has discounted Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster to $29.99 with a limited-time deal, which marks the lowest we've seen this game to date. Originally released in 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS, Bravely Default follows four heroes across the world of Luxendarc as they attempt to reclaim the world's four crystals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bravely Default is a fascinating game for many reasons. It initially was set to be a Final Fantasy game, but it shifted mid-development into its own game despite retaining key elements of the series. Revo, best known for his work as Linked Horizon for Attack on Titan, composed the soundtrack, which is still, to this day, an incredible RPG soundtrack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remaster brought new minigames, a refreshed UI, and other solid quality-of-life features like fast-forward, encounter rate adjustments, and more. While this is unfortunately a Game-Key Card, the download is only 11GB, so you will not need much space available on your Switch 2 to download this one. This is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-nintendo-switch-games">best Switch 2 games</a> you can buy right now, so don't miss out on this deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology. He co-founded Final Weapon, an outlet focused on nonsense-free Japanese gaming (in 2019) and has contributed to various publishers writing about the medium.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 29, 2025 10:47 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/save-on-bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster-today-at-amazon]]></content:encoded>

Off the rip, we're seeing new price drops on pre-built <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-pc">gaming PCs</a>, which are becoming all the more popular given the recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concern-that-skyrocketing-ram-prices-driven-by-ai-needs-will-cause-problems-for-high-end-gaming-for-several-years">price increases on RAM alone</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has also bumped up its Pokémon TCG stock this holiday, but is anything worth buying? Of course it’s not. Well, there’s a handful of deals to be had, but the independent retailer army that makes up TCGPlayer is leading the way with the majority of the best prices on both the new and secondary market.</p><p id="tldr-deals-for-today"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" TL;DR: Deals for Today">TL;DR: Top Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skytech has dropped some cracking deals on a range of their prebuilt gaming PCs before New Year's Day, and we’re seeing RTX 5070 Ti builds for under $2,000 and RTX 5080 builds for under $2,800. Crazy scenes, let’s get into it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">iPhone 16e Offer From Metro by T-Mobile</h2><p id="amazon-pokemon-tcg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Amazon: Pokemon TCG">Cheapest at Amazon: Pokémon TCG</h2></p><div><div id="233887" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At Market Value at Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><div id="233888" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Surging Sparks Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><div id="233897" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Destined Rivals Three Booster Blister</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s great to see popular sets like <strong>Surging Sparks</strong> and <strong>Phantasmal Flames</strong> Elite Trainer Boxes crop up for less on Amazon, with the former being below market value alongside the <strong>Destined Rivals</strong> triple booster.</p><p id="tcgplayer-pokemon-tcg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TCGPlayer: Pokemon TCG">Cheapest at TCGPlayer: Pokémon TCG</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s strange to see <strong>Silver Tempest</strong> sealed product showing up on Amazon right now.

You’ll have solid 1080p gaming with either an Intel i5-14400F or AMD Ryzen 7 5700 processor to boot. Personally, I’d go for the <strong>Crystal</strong> build. It costs the same and gives you far more room for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-graphics-card">bigger GPU upgrades</a> down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking to go all-in with 4K gaming out of the box for under $3,000, the $2,799.99 <strong>Aqua</strong> build comes with a gorgeous clear white and blue case, complete with CPU liquid cooling, an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080</a>, 32GB DDR5, and the absolute beast that is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review">Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-sells-drm-free-pc-storefront-gog-to-original-co-founder-for-252-million-insists-its-financially-stable</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt has sold its DRM-free PC storefront GOG to its original co-founder, Michał Kiciński, for 90.7 million Polish złoty (approx. $25.2 million). Kiciński is also co-founder of CD Projekt itself, and currently holds 10% of share capital in the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kiciński co-founded GOG in 2008, and it has operated within the CD Projekt Group for over 17 years. Selling GOG “fits” CD Projekt’s long-term strategy, according to <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a FAQ posted online</a>. CD Projekt, the Polish company behind smash hits The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077, wants to focus on video game development and other projects, it said. CD Projekt is currently developing The Witcher 4 and Cyberpunk 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Selling GOG fits CD Projekt’s long-term strategy,” reads the statement. “CD Projekt wants to focus its full attention on creating top-quality RPGs and providing our fans with other forms of entertainment based on our brands. This deal lets CD Projekt keep that focus, while GOG gets stronger backing to pursue its own mission.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kiciński commented: “From the very beginning, GOG has always been built on strong values and clear principles. When Marcin Iwiński and I came up with the idea for GOG, the vision was simple: bring classic games back to players and ensure that once you buy a game, it truly belongs to you — forever.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GOG will operate independently, it said, and continue with its DRM-free philosophy. Following the sale, CD Projekt and GOG signed a distribution agreement that specifies the terms of future cooperation, including a plan to release CD Projekt Red’s upcoming games on GOG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“CD Projekt and GOG share the same roots and values: freedom, independence, and a genuine sense of ownership,” Kiciński continued. “I believe that CD Projekt, with its exceptional AAA games, will stand, as always, behind the GOG offering — making GOG the best place on the planet to purchase The Witcher and Cyberpunk games, both existing titles and the new ones we all anticipate so much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a mature gamer, I often play classic games myself and deeply admire the creativity behind many of them. I truly believe that well-crafted classics can deliver as much joy as new releases. When it comes to pure playability, timeless games often prove to be really the safe choice, especially in a market flooded with gazillions of low-quality smaller games. Beyond preserving classics, GOG has always sought out new games with a retro spirit. I am personally involved in the development of a few games like that and they will certainly make their strong appearance on GOG in 2026.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every CD Projekt Red Game In Development</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Michał Nowakowski, joint CEO of CD Projekt, added: “with our focus now fully on an ambitious development roadmap and expanding our franchises with new high-quality products, we felt this was the right time for this move.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For a long time now, GOG has been operating independently. Now it’s going into very good hands — we are convinced that with the support of Michał Kiciński, one of GOG’s co-founders, its future will be full of great projects and successes. We would like to thank the GOG team for years of fruitful cooperation and wish them all the best. And to the GOG community, I say ‘see you around,’ because our upcoming releases will naturally be available on GOG as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GOG has long competed with Steam for the hearts and minds of PC gamers by leaning on its no-DRM policy, although Valve's platform remains the overwhelming market leader. In the FAQ, the question ‘is GOG financially unstable?’ is asked. The answer, officially, is no. “GOG is stable and has had a really encouraging year,” reads the statement. “In fact, we’ve seen more enthusiasm from gamers towards our mission than ever before.” GOG hit the headlines recently for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekts-pc-game-storefront-gog-gets-behind-horses-after-valve-steam-ban-players-should-be-able-to-choose-the-experiences-that-speak-to-them">getting behind indie game Horses after Valve banned it from Steam</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like from a user point of view, nothing changes here. As for CD Projekt, it can now strip out GOG from its business, which at latest count employed 1,335 staff. In The Witcher franchise it has the aforementioned The Witcher 4 as part of a new Witcher trilogy with Ciri as protagonist, The Witcher Remake, and Project Sirius. Cyberpunk 2 is also in development, as is Project Hadar, a new IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
