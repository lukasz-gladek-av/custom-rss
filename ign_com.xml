Up until now, even if you physically had a Switch 2 in your hands, the device was firmly locked offline.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Nintendo has also used today's Mario Kart World update to make several tweaks to the game itself. Intriguingly, the patch unlocks a wider pool of characters for you to play from the off. Presumably, Nintendo had originally intended for more racers to require unlocking.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've increased the number of characters that can be selected from the start," a line of Nintendo's patch notes confirms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another tweak is that there had been a time limit for deciding on a course when playing in local multiplayer, as there presumably still will be when playing online. This has also been removed, as of today's patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing this Mario Kart World patch doesn't add is 200cc mode. Instead, it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-wont-include-200cc-mode-but-nintendo-isnt-ruling-out-it-arriving-post-launch-im-afraid-i-cant-say-just-yet">seems likely Nintendo will add the tougher difficulty option to the game post-launch</a>, just as it did in Mario Kart 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's full patch notes lie below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mario Kart World Ver. 1.1.0 ［2025.6.5］</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">General</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added support for "Camera Play.<br>" *A USB camera (sold separately) is required for "Camera Play.<br>" *You can choose to turn the camera on or off for "Everyone" and "Internet.<br>" *When the camera is turned on, the player's face will be displayed during the race.</li><li>You can now play "On the Internet."</li><li>"LAN Play" is now available.<br>* On the title screen, press the L stick while pressing the L and R buttons to switch from "Local Communication" to "LAN Play."</li><li>You can now upload/download ghosts in Time Attack.</li><li>In “Free Run” the icons of nearby players are now displayed.</li><li>We've increased the number of characters that can be selected from the start.</li><li>Improved operability when playing with three or more people in "Everyone."</li><li>The time limit for deciding on a course has been removed when playing Locally or LAN.</li><li>The update data version is now displayed on the title screen.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Could Nintendo be planning to do the exact same thing for the series' follow-up? It seems very likely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/mario-kart-world-switch-2-nintendo-kosuke-yabuki-1235350685/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, Mario Kart World producer Kosuke Yabuki acknowledged that 200cc had been a popular addition to the series, but stopped short of confirming anything around its return — for now. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Some players are really happy with the addition of high difficulty modes likes this," Kosuke teased. "However, does that mean we're going to consider adding engine sizes that are larger than 150cc to Mario Kart World? I'm afraid I can't say just yet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not surprising that Nintendo has not included 200cc within Mario Kart World at launch. The mode's arrival at a later date allows the game's fans to learn courses and get used to playing at the standard 150cc (or lower, if you need) before the tougher challenge of 200cc arrives at a later date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This will likely only be more of a consideration with Mario Kart World's multiplayer-friendly gameplay, in which groups of players are encouraged to team up and explore together, their GameChat open, and cameras switched on. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Presumably, whenever Mario Kart World's 200cc update does arrive, all players will need to be playing at the same level to explore the game's map together. It's therefore better, once again, to let players get to grips with 150cc first before things step up a gear, or engine size.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World launches this week alongside Nintendo Switch 2, and boasts a seamless map that can be explored at will. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-open-world-isnt-what-you-think-it-is">Just don't go into this offering expecting it to be like Forza Horizon</a>, IGN has said. And in other important Mario Kart news, IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/does-cow-eat-beef-we-asked-the-mario-kart-world-producer">asked Nintendo if the game's already-beloved Cow character is really eating beef</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Unknown Worlds has dropped a new 10-minute Q&amp;A about all things <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/subnautica-2"><u>Subnautica 2</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbvNYN76ArQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>video interview</u></a> between community manager Donya Abramo and creative producer Scott MacDonald gives us few more details about what's coming up in the action survival game, including confirmation that we're going back to a silent protagonist. There was also an emphasis on assuring fans that rather than being a co-op game that lets you play solo, Unknown Worlds has specifically designed Subnautica 2 to be a single-player adventure with optional co-op (yes, there <em>is</em> a difference!). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for just how big Subnautica 2 will be? "The playable map size will be bigger than what we originally launched in early access on the original Subnautica, and even Below Zero's early access release," said MacDonald. "But just how big and how deep you'll be able to go over the course of early access? We're not exactly sure yet. The entire world is being handcrafted by a talented team of world designers and environment artists, and they're pouring everything into the world right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're aiming for this to be the biggest and most exciting Subnautica game ever once we hit 1.0 in a few years' time."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not everything is coming back bigger and better, though. Apparently, the Cyclops, Seamoth, and Sea Truck will not return, but new vehicles are being developed that are "designed in the same spirit, just more suited to the brand new environment they need to navigate."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Though a big sub won't be ready for the start of early access, know that the team is hard at work behind the scenes crafting one," added Abramo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we're still no closer to a concrete release date, the team did confirm an early access period will launch later this year, and it's because of that early access period that the release is limited to PC and Xbox — there is no way of releasing an early access product on PlayStation as yet. There is sadly no VR support at this time, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, there are no plans for proximity chat, but the option is "being investigated" by the development team. In the meantime, it's recommended you connect with your pals via Discord. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new installment in the Subnautica series <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-adds-a-new-planet-and-co-op-in-2025"><u>accommodates up to four players</u></a>, taking them to an all-new planet, complete with new environments, flora, and fauna to discover. We still don't know when it's coming, but you'll be able to dive in sometime later in 2025 on PC and Xbox Series, including on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/xbox-game-pass"><u>Game Pass</u></a> for top-tier subscribers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We thought predecessor Subnautica was amazing, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/26/subnautica-review"><u>awarding it a 9.1</u></a>, writing: "Subnautica's a survival game with focus and an excellent sci-fi story, but its greatest achievement is its underwater horror."
