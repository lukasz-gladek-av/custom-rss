Games has released a new trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> that reveals a brief first look at upcoming guest character T-1000 Terminator and a Conan the Barbarian's Brutality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the trailer is focused on Mortal Kombat eSports, it showcases Conan the Barbarian gameplay that sees the warrior cut his hapless opponent in half during a particularly stabby Brutality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also get a brief first look at T-1000 Terminator, showing its hand returning to human form from liquid metal form in a scene that rekindles memories of blockbuster action movie Terminator 2. It very much looks like Mortal Kombat 1's T-1000 is based on Robert Patrick, who played the character in the film, and we understand Patrick voices T-1000, too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/15/screenshot-2025-01-15-143119-1736951538114.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mortal Kombat 1's T-1000.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Conan the Barbarian, due out January 21 as part of the standard DLC early access period for Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion owners before wide availability a week later, features the likeness of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who famously played Conan in the cult classic 1982 film, but does not feature his voice. The official Conan the Barbarian gameplay trailer will be debuted on tomorrow‚Äôs Kombat Kast, giving fans a deeper dive on this powerful fighter. Release timing and availability for T-1000 Terminator will be announced at a later date, Warner Bros. said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">T-1000 Terminator is the final DLC character added to the gory fighting game as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and, later this month, Conan the Barbarian. Fans have been wondering for some time now whether developer NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters amid questions about Mortal Kombat 1‚Äôs sales success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For its part, Warner Bros. Games has announced Mortal Kombat 1 has sold more than four million copies, and in November Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady">the company plans to double down on just four titles, including Mortal Kombat</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago">NetherRealm chief Ed Boon said the developer decided on its next game three years ago, but promised to support Mortal Kombat 1 ‚Äúfor a long time to come.‚Äù</a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans of the studio‚Äôs work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, although neither NetherRealm nor owner and publisher Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that. The first game in the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-gods-among-us"><u>Injustice: Gods Among Us</u></a>, launched in 2013, with its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-2"><u>Injustice 2</u></a>, coming out in 2017. NetherRealm released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-11"><u>Mortal Kombat 11</u></a> in 2019 and for a time it seemed like the studio would alternate between Mortal Kombat and Injustice games, but it went on to release another Mortal Kombat, the soft reboot that is Mortal Kombat 1, in 2023 instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-ed-boon-says-door-not-closed-on-injustice-3"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> in June 2023, Boon spoke in vague terms about this decision. "There were a number of factors, some of which I can talk about, some of which I probably shouldn't," Boon said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two reasons Boon was willing to discuss were the unfortunate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the team's choice to switch to a newer version of the Unreal game engine (Mortal Kombat 11 runs on Unreal Engine 3, whereas Mortal Kombat 1 runs on Unreal Engine 4).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But we did go to a new graphics engine, Unreal," Boon said. "We really wanted to be careful with COVID and all that stuff and everybody staying safe. So there were a bunch of variables involved that eventually we realized, 'Okay, let's do another Mortal Kombat game and hopefully we'll get back to the Injustice games.' "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to be sure, we wanted to confirm with him directly that the door was not closed on the Injustice franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not at all," Boon answered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

You even help a living finger work through anger issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where Promise Mascot Agency is punching above its weight is in the voice cast department. It‚Äôs nabbed PlayStation developer legend Shuhei Yoshida in his first ever video game voice role, and the announcement comes hot on the heels of Yoshida‚Äôs last day at Sony.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">At farewell party yesterday üòÜ <a href="https://t.co/hpiPWQIO1z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/hpiPWQIO1z</a></p>‚Äî Shuhei Yoshida (@yosp) <a href="https://twitter.com/yosp/status/1879264451079315564?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Shuhei Yoshida worked on PlayStation from the very beginning, playing a key role in the original console‚Äôs success from 1993. He was one of the more public-facing PlayStation executives while President of SIE Worldwide Studios from 2008 to 2019, championing indie and VR success in particular. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-retiring-from-sony-in-january">Yoshida announced his exit from Sony in November during his 31st year at PlayStation</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on,‚Äù he explained at the time. ‚ÄúYou know, the company‚Äôs been doing great. I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I‚Äôm so excited for the future of PlayStation."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Yoshida long-term plan remains up in the air, in the short-term he‚Äôs turned to video game voice acting, and that's where Promise Mascot Agency comes in. Yoshida plays Monouge, an odd-looking green-skinned former mascot who is opening their own game center.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida isn‚Äôt the only big name joining the Promise Mascot Agency voice cast. Yakuza: Like A Dragon‚Äôs Takaya Kuroda, who plays series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, and Legend of Zelda‚Äôs Ayano Shibuya also star, as do Eri Saito (Chainsaw Man, Metal Gear Solid 4, Way of the Samurai 3) and Swery, developer of Deadly Premonition, The Good Life, and Spy Fiction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see what Yoshida and co sound like in-game in the exclusive trailer, below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt believe that our weird game managed to attract such a strong voice cast,‚Äù said game director Oli Clarke Smith.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWhen our lead Japanese localiser, Roppyaku Tsurumi, told us that Kuroda-san had auditioned, we just about lost our minds. All of the cast have brought our group of misfits to life wonderfully. After working on these characters for four years, they have become like friends to us, and we‚Äôre so happy that they have all been given a voice. The team at the recording studio, Xenorex, did an amazing job.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here‚Äôs the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Takaya Kuroda voices the disgraced ex-yakuza Michi, exiled to the forgotten (and quite definitely cursed) Japanese town of Kaso-Machi with two goals: pay off his debt and restore glory to the town‚Äôs defunct mascot agency! Recruit the weird and wonderful mascots across town with help from your severed finger assistant manager and chaos goblin, Pinky‚òÜ - voiced by Ayana Shibuya, negotiate their contracts and assign them jobs they love.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Promise Mascot Agency will be available on PC and consoles early 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Stuart Wilson/BAFTA/Getty Images for BAFTA.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

In March 2024, developers of Nintendo Switch emulator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settled-for-24-million-between-nintendo-and-tropic-haze"><u>Yuzu</u></a> were ordered to pay $2.4 million in damages after a court settlement with Nintendo. In October 2024, Switch emulator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-emulator-ryujinx-nintendo"><u>Ryujinx</u></a> ceased development following ‚Äúcontact from Nintendo.‚Äù In 2023, the developers behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dolphin-emulator-wont-release-on-steam-after-all"><u>Dolphin</u></a>, an emulator for Gamecube and Wii, were advised against a full Steam release by lawyers at Valve, who were contacted by Nintendo‚Äôs lawyers alongside ‚Äústrong legal wording.‚Äù </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most famously, in 2023 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-released-from-prison-still-owes-millions"><u>Gary Bowser</u></a>, a reseller of Team Xecuter products that allowed users to bypass the Nintendo Switch‚Äôs anti-piracy measures, was charged with fraud and ordered to pay $14.5m back to Nintendo, a debt he will repay for life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, a patent lawyer representing Nintendo has lifted the lid on the company‚Äôs approach to piracy and emulation, and discussed how the propagation of emulators could lead to software piracy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a report from <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/kikakuthetower/250112a#i-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Denfaminicogamer</u></a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/are-emulators-illegal-or-not-nintendo-lawyer-explains-why-its-been-taking-them-down/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>) at Tokyo eSports Festa 2025, ‚ÄúIntellectual Property Managers‚Äù from Capcom, Sega, and Nintendo gathered to discuss the laws designed to protect companies‚Äô intellectual property. Speaking for Nintendo was a patent attorney and Assistant Manager of the Intellectual Property Division, Koji Nishiura. In a translation by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendos-attorney-weighs-in-on-what-makes-emulators-illegal/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>, he explained: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúTo begin with, are emulators illegal or not? This is a point often debated. While you can‚Äôt immediately claim that an emulator is illegal in itself, it can become illegal depending on how it‚Äôs used.‚Äù </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nishiura explained further that if an emulator copies a program from the game it is running, it may constitute copyright infringement, and this is also the case if the emulator can disable a console‚Äôs security mechanisms. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is largely down to Japan‚Äôs ‚Äú<a href="https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/view/3629" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Unfair Competition Prevention Act</u></a>,‚Äù or UCPA, which is only enforceable in Japan itself. This makes it more difficult for Nintendo to pursue legal action overseas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The example given in a slide during the Tokyo eSports Festa talk was the Nintendo DS ‚ÄúR4‚Äù card, which allowed users of the cartridge to circumvent and run backed-up or pirated versions of games on a single cartridge. Ultimately, after Nintendo and 50 other software manufacturers cried out about the R4, Nintendo won a ruling that the manufacturers and resellers violated the UCPA, effectively <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-after-sales-ban-japan-finally-blocks-import-of-r4-cartridges" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>outlawing sales of the R4 in 2009</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nishiura further explained that tools that allow users to download pirated software within an emulator or piece of software would also constitute copyright law infringement. Named ‚Äúreach apps‚Äù in Japanese law, these third-party tools like the 3DS‚Äôs infamous ‚ÄúFreeshop,‚Äù or third-party app installer ‚ÄúTinfoil‚Äù for Switch, may also violate copyright laws.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its Yuzu lawsuit, Nintendo claimed that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-tears-of-the-kingdom-was-pirated-1-million-times-pre-release-in-lawsuit-against-emulator-creator">pirated one million times</a>. Specifically, the filing claimed that Yuzu's Patreon page allowed its developers to earn $30,000 per month by providing subscribers with "daily updates," "early access," and "special unreleased features" to games like Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Sayem is a freelancer based in the UK, covering tech and hardware.
