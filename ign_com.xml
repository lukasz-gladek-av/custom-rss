            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo doesn't really need to create new franchises, a former developer has said, explaining that the company can simply wrap its fresh gameplay ideas into one of the many beloved video game series it owns already. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-05/nintendo-invents-new-ways-to-have-fun-with-old-characters" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, programmer Ken Watanabe said Nintendo doesn't "really fuss over" which of its big franchises a fun new gameplay mechanic might end up in. And, with so many existing series to chose from, there's little need to come up with more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"New franchises haven't come out simply because there's no real need to make them," Watanabe said. "When Nintendo wants to do something new, it's basically about the gameplay mechanics first — about creating a new way to play."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At Nintendo, Watanabe worked on Super Mario Bros. Wii, Pikmin 3 and Splatoon — one of the company's biggest new franchises of its modern era. But even the first Splatoon is now a decade old. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As for the skin or the wrapper, they don't really fuss over it," Watanabe continued. "They just pick whatever fits that new gameplay best."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo's long list of existing IP certainly seems expansive and beloved enough to support this. Why make a new spaceship combat series when it's been years since the last Star Fox? Why create a fresh arcade racer when you could make a new F-Zero? (Though, let's be real, Nintendo is never making a new,  fully fledged F-Zero.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Nintendo Game of 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo already has most genres covered, and existing fans waiting with baited breath for the next entries in series such as Animal Crossing, Pikmin and Fire Emblem. It makes sense that, if Nintendo did have new gameplay ideas for existing genres, it could just co-opt one of its existing series too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, for example, which Nintendo has described as "the first Splatoon series spin-off." It <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-just-announced-splatoon-raiders-for-switch-2-with-a-trailer-exclusive-to-the-nintendo-today-app">looks set to focus on a specific hero character and potentially feature more adventure-led gameplay than its quick-fire shooting predecessors</a>. Could this have been a new IP instead? Maybe, but spinning it off from the hugely popular Splatoon means it instantly appeals to an existing fanbase and has better brand recognition. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo hasn't completely ditched the idea of new franchises, of course — though it's fair to say that the company tests fewer new IPs now than it once did. Nintendo's most recent new idea was the just-released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/drag-x-drive-review">Drag x Drive</a>, its wheelchair basketball game that utilised the Switch 2's motion controls. It's hard to see how that could have fitted into an existing franchise — though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/drag-x-drive-review">maybe plonking Mario and friends into its arenas might have helped</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The technology is being used once again for Saber’s 2026 release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/john-carpenters-toxic-commando">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN at gamescom 2025, Saber development chief Tim Willits said 30 million people had played World War Z since launch, which is a remarkable milestone for any game. But, he thinks its popularity might have influenced some decisions made in Hollywood, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/david-ellison-top-gun-star-trek-1236343043/?utm_source=syndication&amp;pubDate=20250814" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a> said Paramount had three franchises it planned to prioritize when it came to movies: Top Gun 3, Star Trek, and World War Z. World War Z was the biggest surprise here, given it’s been over a decade since the movie came out. So why is Paramount interested in making a follow-up?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter Saber’s World War Z. Willits said it was his feeling (he hasn’t been told this is the case in an official capacity) that the enduring success of the World War Z video game over the last six years has directly contributed to Paramount’s desire to revive the franchise in movie terms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“30 million people have played that game. Isn't that crazy? 30 million unique people,” Willits began. “They have not told me this — I'll probably get in trouble! — they have not told me this, but maybe IGN put this on Instagram, that there's talk at Paramount about making another World War Z. Again, they have not told me this, but I'm pretty sure it’s because of that game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They have not told me this. I'm guessing!” Willits continued. “30 million people. That's f***ing ridiculous! I saw that [the Paramount news] and I was like, ‘Oh that’s gotta be us.’”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Zombie Movies</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this isn't the first time an effort to make World War Z 2 was started. World War Z was a commercial success upon its release in 2013, grossing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/12/world-war-z-is-brad-pitts-highest-grossing-film">over $540 million worldwide at the box office</a> (it was Pitt's highest-grossing film <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-is-brad-pitts-highest-grossing-film-of-all-time-overtaking-world-war-z">before the recently released F1 movie overtook it</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paramount confirmed its plans to make a sequel shortly after, but planning turned patchy after Marc Foster, director of the first film, announced that he <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/06/paramount-halts-preproduction-on-world-war-z-sequel">would not be returning to helm</a> the second feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was a further shake-up that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/27/david-fincher-reportedly-closing-in-on-directing-world-war-z-sequel">resulted in David Fincher signing on</a> as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/world-war-z-sequel-loses-director-bayona">J.A. Bayona's replacement</a> in the director's chair. However, the sequel never pulled together as Paramount decided to halt pre-production in 2019, reportedly due to budget issues and a lack of momentum, even though production was supposed to begin that year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/david-fincher-cancelled-world-war-z-sequel-a-little-like-the-last-of-us">Fincher likened his scrapped World War Z sequel to HBO's The Last of Us TV adaptation</a>, saying he was glad his movie didn't make it beyond pre-production. Fincher told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/david-fincher-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a> that there were some notable similarities between his Brad Pitt-fronted follow-up film to World War Z and the HBO adaptation of Naughty Dog's The Last of Us, so much so that he was left feeling happy his project never came together because he felt the other had "more real estate" to tackle the same topics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was a little like The Last of Us," Fincher said, teasing what he had planned for the World War Z sequel. "I'm glad that we didn't do what we were doing because The Last of Us has a lot more real estate to explore the same stuff. In our title sequence, we were going to use the little parasite... they used it in their title sequence and in that wonderful opening with the Dick Cavett, David Frost-style talk show."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/08/gettyimages-526328424-1757318690970.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Will Brad Pitt return for World War Z 2? Photo by Lars Niki/Corbis via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The question for fans of World War Z the movie is of course whether Pitt would return for a potential sequel, or if Paramount would go for a brand new cast. Meanwhile, any new World War Z movie would clearly benefit Saber’s game, and perhaps spark a conversation about a video game sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not supposed to say anything, but we have cool stuff to talk about in that game in the future,” is all Willits would tease about World War Z.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more from our interview with Willits, including his comments on how <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-developer-says-a-large-chunk-of-fans-have-assumptions-about-the-warhammer-40000-universe-that-are-not-correct-as-a-result-of-the-huge-success-of-the-game">a large chunk of fans have “assumptions” about the Warhammer 40,000 universe that are incorrect as a result of the huge success of the game</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/delaying-space-marine-2-was-the-smartest-thing-we-ever-did-saber-reflects-on-the-biggest-warhammer-40000-game-of-all-time-after-a-year-of-dlc-and-looks-to-the-future"><u>why delaying Space Marine 2 was the best thing Saber ever did</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-the-inquisition-watching-tight-lipped-saber-chief-wont-say-much-about-warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-but-he-has-revealed-games-workshop-is-offering-up-some-ideas-that-are-amazing">vague excitement about Space Marine 3</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Lars Niki/Corbis via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
