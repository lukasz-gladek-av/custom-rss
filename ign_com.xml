            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A social hub in the vein of Destiny 2's Tower is "on the feature list" for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a>'s successor, developer Arrowhead has indicated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 uses spaceships as a small staging area where up to three players can prepare for missions, fussing over their appearance and loadouts. There is no larger scale social hub, which some fans have called for Arrowhead to consider given the social nature of Helldivers 2's community-driven galactic war.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When a fan suggested on Discord that they would "really appreciate a social hub space station (like the tower in Destiny)," Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1414308725400801489" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>responded</u></a> with an unequivocal: "it's on the feature list for the next one."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That sounds pretty definitive, but we still have no idea when Arrowhead will get around to Helldivers 3. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-wants-helldivers-2-to-be-around-for-years-and-years-and-years-to-come-and-what-about-a-warhammer-40000-collab">The studio has indicated that it plans to support Helldivers 2 for years to come</a>, and only recently launched the Sony-published game on Xbox Series X and S. Indeed, itâ€™s a particularly great time for Helldivers 2, whose Into the Unjust update added Hive Worlds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In April, Helldivers 2 production director Alex Bolle told IGN "we want it to be around for years and years and years to come."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And it's almost like, how do we stay true to the Helldivers 2 fantasy, challenging enough that we keep making amazing new features and new systems and all that while we stay true to who we are?" he continued. "And I think it's something that is so motivating for the years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The more we figure out how to thrive in a live environment, and we still have a way to go to figure out a lot of things around that, the more we can let creativity loose on new systems that we would've never thought about a year ago when we released. I've worked on live games before and it's where you feel like you have something you can figure out: what if I would do this cool thing I've seen in other games and adapt it to our sauce, that still makes it true to ourselves? I'm looking forward to this moment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review-update-now-on-xbox-series-xs">review of Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series X and S</a> to see what we think of the game as it is today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
