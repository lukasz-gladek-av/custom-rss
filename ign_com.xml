            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assetto-corsa-evo-early-access-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Assetto Corsa Evo is easily one of the most exciting racing games of 2025. The huge open-world map of German countryside surrounding the famous Nürburgring Nordschleife that developer Kunos Simulazioni is currently crafting for it should make it one of the biggest in the genre. Literally, that is. The map is going to be 1,600 square kilometres in size. That’s about 15 Forza Horizon 5s. However, we’ll need to be patient for that, as the first chunk of it isn’t set to arrive in Evo’s evolving early access version until mid-year, and then grow from there. For now, at least, we get five tracks and 20 cars to noodle around in. The good news is that the driving feel is unsurprisingly fabulous, right out of the gate. At this point, however, that’s… essentially it. It’s hard to argue Evo makes a strong case as an immediately <em>crucial </em>purchase in this early state if you’re not especially keen on taking some warm-up laps before the main event kicks off.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’d be unfair to haul Assetto Corsa Evo over the coals too severely for its current technical blemishes. Yes, I’ve had it hitch up and drop frames occasionally and, yes, it’s crashed or frozen on me several times following its launch – although I’ve certainly had lengthy stints on-track where it’s been entirely cooperative on my current high-powered PC setup (RTX 4080, Intel Core Ultra 9 185H). Overall, it’s admittedly not running on all cylinders right now, but that’s the nature of ‘Early Access’ as a concept. We obviously need to be prepared for it to be a little more <em>Alpha</em> Romeo than Alfa Romeo at this point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And while five circuits and 20 available cars is modest, it does make for a decent amount of combinations to experiment with – and that’s without factoring in the adjustable wet weather options that obviously have very real effects on handling. If you think you’ll be happy to simply hotlap solo around the initial tracks (which include Mount Panorama, Brands Hatch, Imola, Laguna Seca, and Suzuka), Evo’s early access version may keep you busy for at least a few days. It’s certainly worth remembering the early access program for Evo’s immediate predecessor, Assetto Corsa Competizione, launched with just <em>a single car and a single track</em> – the Lamborghini Huracan GT3 race car and the Nürburgring GP circuit. By comparison, Evo’s launch is at least a considerably chunkier one.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The first salvo of circuits includes a track from the US, Japan, the UK, continental Europe, and Australia. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Moreover, it’s a well-curated one. Notice, for instance, the first salvo of circuits includes a track from the US, Japan, the UK, continental Europe, and Australia. That’s a thoughtful mix that I don’t doubt was deliberate. Similarly, the short but sweet car list includes a spectrum of vehicles, ranging from front-wheel drive hatches to purpose-built race models. The feel of the cars I’ve tested so far has been top notch. I won’t pretend to be able to gauge the accuracy of the tyre model with the kind of insight you might glean from a professional racing driver, because I’m not one; I’m a car nerd journalist with a handful of trackdays in my past that I’m skeptical I’ll ever be able to afford to repeat. What I can say is the sensation of grip is excellent and I was instantly confident to push hard across the top of the mountain at Bathurst. Things always get a little murky when I’m comparing experiences gleaned many years ago using totally different racing setups (I personally migrated from a Thrustmaster TS-XW racing wheel to a direct drive Moza R12 some years ago), but Evo already seems to have nailed that feeling of being able to overdrive a car but still snap it back under control, because the grip will return as long as you wrestle it back into the window. That always suits me, as I’m a bit more of a butcher than a surgeon when it comes to racing sims these days. Forget the whole world turning into ice the second you slip into a slide; Evo is wonderfully intuitive.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to ACC, race cars also feel a little less punishingly stiff and cling to the track more tenaciously, even while clattering over bumps or kerbs. In ACC, I generally felt like I was going as fast as I could without losing control. In Evo, I’ve found I feel like I <em>could </em>probably push faster. If I had the skill, that is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a really great feeling of balance, especially as cars squirm under braking, and the feel of the front end becoming lighter and heavier based on elevation changes is nice and pronounced. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yes, in the tradition of the original Assetto Corsa and ACC before it, Evo is already a genuinely terrific driving experience. But does that make this first taste a must-play?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, no. Not really. If you get it today you’re essentially just pre-ordering the final game at a slightly discounted price. That alone could be reason enough for you to grab it, and it’s a totally fair argument. However, other than confirming it feels good, there’s just not really much more joy to extract from Evo for the time being. As a man who peeled countless demo discs from the front of magazines back in ’90s, I’ve certainly got nothing against what’s essentially a hefty demo, but it’s not one I really want to keep playing anymore after seeing all of its tracks. But I’ll definitely be back for more when it’s available and some of the more annoying aspects have been resolved. </p><div id="rank-todays-top-racing-simulators" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank today's top racing simulators</h3><h3>Rank today's top racing simulators</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Simply put, the racing itself just isn’t that robust at the moment, and it’s tedious being punted off track by computer-controlled opponents who simply try to drive through you around corners. I don’t know what the answer is, but the AI certainly still needs work. There have definitely been times when other cars seemed to be deliberately giving me racing room, and others where they’ve made unscripted mistakes. That’s good, because it creates the illusion they’re not just machines. It’s also true that getting speared into from behind is an unfortunate reality in real racing. Incidents happen, sure. But it’d be something that would happen to you quite irregularly in reality, whereas it’s far too common in Evo for racing to remain fun. If I wanted to get rear-ended for kicks, I’d brake-check Lance Stroll in a drive-thru.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If I wanted to get rear-ended for kicks, I’d brake-check Lance Stroll in a drive-thru.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a pretty big problem when these races are largely all Evo offers in its current condition. There were supposed to be some other modes available, based on what was announced when the early access version launched, but ever since I started playing Evo has been stuck in ‘Offline’ mode. Evo’s Driving Academy mode and Special Events are currently inaccessible to me. All I can do is generate custom practice or race sessions. Tying functionality to an always-online caveat is very concerning, and I cannot fathom why it’s necessary for single-player content. Fortunately, there’s still plenty of time for Kunos to tweak that on the road map ahead.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Assetto Corsa Evo already feels absolutely fantastic behind the wheel but, with aggravating AI opponents slamming into you every which way and hamstrung as it is by online-only features that are currently inaccessible, it doesn’t feel like an essential early access purchase. The handling may be excellent, but I’ll be parking it up and waiting for the finished product – including the promised epic-sized map of Germany – before I put the keys back in the ignition.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-growth-indiana-jones-great-circle-call-of-duty-hardware-falls<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle records 4 million players.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Q2 investors call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle has reached 4 million players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an otherwise ho-hum earnings report for its gaming division, a bright spot appears to be MachineGames' newest release which has garnered critical acclaim, multiple awards, and now millions of players. While sales numbers are hard to pin down given its availability on Xbox Game Pass, 4 million is still an impressive number of players considering not many people knew exactly what to expect in a modern, AAA Indiana Jones game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We loved it ourselves, calling it an "irrestistable and immersive global treasure hunt," along with nominations for Game of the Year and Best Xbox game. You can read our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">full review here</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in Xbox land, Microsoft confirmed that Game Pass PC grew 30%  last quarter and set a new quarterly revenue record. On the cloud gaming side, 140 million hours of streaming has been logged. All this helped Xbox content and service revenue grow 2%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's still work to be done however. While the Game Pass figures were stronger than expected, overall gaming revenue declined 7% and Xbox hardware revenue declined 29%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this all mean? Well, Microsoft still has ground to make up in the console and hardware space, but its continued investment into Game Pass appears to be paying off. Game Pass growth on PC makes sense given Xbox had a slate of big game releases last quarter that includes Indiana Jones but also Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Microsoft Flight Simulator. All of which were available on Game Pass day one for Ultimate subscribers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
