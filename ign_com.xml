            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Abyss has to wait a while longer.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bandai Namco is teasing another remaster of a game in the Tales series, and it sure looks like it's going to be Tales of Xillia.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfIytHHiIyU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upcoming livestream</a> published to the Tales of YouTube Channel, which premieres tomorrow at 7am PT / 10am ET. Currently, the livestream is just a still that reads: "The Next Tales Of Remastered is...?"</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Next Tales of Remastered project will be announced on Aug 19th - 7 AM PT <a href="https://t.co/pIlI4mrGeF" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/pIlI4mrGeF</a> <a href="https://t.co/BiZ7Q42qUV" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/BiZ7Q42qUV</a></p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1957447195914887439?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">However, as has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tales/comments/1mpzywl/tales_of_newsxillia_leak_youtube_screenshots/?share_id=0uqQYmDmE5O1zVvyd5Pxy&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out on social media</a>, a version of this video accidentally went live on the Bandai Namco Europe page a few days ago that showed the remaster to be Tales of Xillia. So it looks like that's what we're getting tomorrow in an early morning livestream, surprisingly hours ahead of Gamescom Opening Night Live later in the afternoon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tales of Xillia first launched in 2011 in Japan and 2013 elsewhere, and follows two characters, Jude and Milla, who uncover a powerful and destructive weapon and set out on a quest to stop its use. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/06/tales-of-xillia-review">gave it an 8/10 back in the day</a>, making it a great candidate for a remaster especially given that it's been a PS3-exclusive up til now and difficult to go back and play. It also sparked a sequel, Tales of Xillia 2, which was similarly locked to PS3.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All that said, some fans will likely be disappointed that this isn't the Tales of remaster they were hoping for. Last year, Bandai Namco <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-graces-f-dev-talks-about-tales-of-the-abyss-remaster-possibilities-and-the-future-of-the-series">announced a Tales of Remastered Program</a>, starting with Tales of Graces f (a Tales of Symphonia remaster was released the year prior). At the time, we asked producer Yuki Ishikawa about the very popular Tales of the Abyss, widely-regarded as one of the best Tales games, and whether it might be up for a remaster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If [a Tales of the Abyss remaster] could happen and I could share that joy with the rest of the fans, that’s something I’ll work hard towards,” Ishikawa said. Meanwhile, I'm over here as the only person carrying the torch for Zestiria, but I can wait my turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
