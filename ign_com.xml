And although taking care of a farm is its own full-time job, I always try to find time to make every character's favorite foods. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Cooking_Recipes">recipes in Stardew Valley</a> can be pretty simple but the final pixelated result always looks appetizing to me. I've definitely imagined what each dish tastes like as I whip it up in the game, but I never really thought about making the recipes in real life until I came across the Stardew Valley cookbook.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The official cookbook for the game was written in collaboration with the game's creator <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/author/concernedape/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ConcernedApe</a> (Eric Barone). As someone who loves Stardew Valley and cooking, I've put this video game cookbook at the top of my gift wishlist for 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Official Stardew Valley Cookbook - On Sale Now</h2><div catalogid="a88aae3d-ede0-4fa4-bdfc-1cf973d04f49" id="219886"><div id="219886" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Official Stardew Valley Cookbook</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Official Stardew Valley Cookbook came out back in May 2024, so it's been almost an entire year of me not knowing it existed. Thanks to all of that time, however, it is currently down to its <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/1984862057" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest price ever on Amazon</a>. At just under $20, it's one of the cheapest gifts you could get for Stardew fan (other than the actual game).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cookbook itself contains 50 recipes that are based on the actual in-game meals. Similar to the game, it's ordered by season so you can follow along and make each recipe when the ingredients are most likely to be at their freshest. Included are a ton of original illustrations as well as recipes written in the voice of various characters from the game. You can check out a quick preview of what to expect in the slideshow below.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Stardew Valley Cookbook Preview</h3></div></output></p><h3 data-cy="title3">See more video game cookbooks</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Altough the Stardew Valley cookbook is my favorite one of these, there are actually quite a few <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-cookbooks">other video game cookbooks</a> you can buy right now. There are options from Elder Scrolls, The Witcher, Fallout, and even Minecraft. You can preorder cookbooks made for Pac-Man (sure, why not) and Borderlands, both of which are coming out in 2025. This is a whole genre that is absolutely thriving.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 1, 2025 3:55 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-ceo-says-youll-sht-your-pants-over-whats-coming-down-the-pipe<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Hopefully the update includes some new pants, then.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> is gearing up for some news, and developer Arrowhead Game Studios seems confident it will impress. Or, as Arrowhead's CEO is framing it, you might want to prepare yourself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/helldivers-2-ceo-warns-players-over-whats-coming/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VideoGamer</a>, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani was discussing Helldivers 2 in the game's Discord when a user asked him if he could "offer up anything, however small, of what's coming down the pipe." His response?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You'll shit your pants."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While not specific about what's in store, it does at least give us an idea of the <em>impact</em> of what's in store. And the possible consequences to our britches, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jorjani took a few other questions, with some notable mentions of wanting to add more bladed weapons and some thoughtful responses to worries about content droughts. There's some open transparency about the technical debt of something like Helldivers 2, and how the team handles it over time, that's really cool to see alongside funny quotes about distressing your jeans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's already been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-teasing-some-exciting-news-and-a-new-fight-on-the-horizon">some tease about what's to come</a>, involving a flag with both a pointy end and a grippy section. Currently, Arrowhead said it is aiming for May 8 to announce its next Warbond, and there will be "more exciting news to come not long after."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-wants-helldivers-2-to-be-around-for-years-and-years-and-years-to-come-and-what-about-a-warhammer-40000-collab">recent interview with IGN</a>, Arrowhead's production director Alex Bolle said the studio wants to be around for "years and years and years to come," and that it's continuing to work on developing Helldivers 2 while staying true to what the team wants to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The more we figure out how to thrive in a live environment, and we still have a way to go to figure out a lot of things around that, the more we can let creativity loose on new systems that we would've never thought about a year ago when we released," Bolle told IGN. "I've worked on live games before and it's where you feel like you have something you can figure out: what if I would do this cool thing I've seen in other games and adapt it to our sauce, that still makes it true to ourselves? I'm looking forward to this moment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll start to find out what cool things Arrowhead has in store for Helldivers 2 next week. You might want to bring some extra pants.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
