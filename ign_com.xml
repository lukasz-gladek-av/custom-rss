This area hosts a series of bosses that are designed to provide some of the toughest challenges in the hit role-playing game, though they still shouldn't take the average endgame player anywhere near eight hours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Only reason it took me this long is because I haven't properly built Verso for damage in the millions yet," Recordbreaks admitted, saying his squad was still around level 80. "He was doing maybe 200,000 damage per hit and that's if Roulette was working in my favor which it wasn't most of the time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some fans have said Recordbreaks could simply have quit the battle, sorted their build then restarted, the vast majority of fans are praising the player for putting in an actual work shift's worth of time to beat the boss anyway. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Most surreal of all, however? Throughout the whole battle, Recordbreaks avoided dodging to the point where not a single successful dodge is recorded, opting instead for the tougher option to parry attacks every time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"22 parries a minute, pretty much one parry every three seconds," one fan noted, after doing the math. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Bro that's a full-time job spent for that boss and 10k parries damn," admired xXxZeroTwoxXx. "Congrats bud."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Why? Cuz I felt like it," Recordbreaks replied, when asked the reason for their perseverance. "How? With sheer will and determination. What's wrong with me? Haven't gone to a therapist to work that out yet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With work on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 now complete, fans are already speculating what might come next, as the game's developer has teased that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yes-another-clair-obscur-game-is-coming-expedition-33-is-one-of-the-stories-that-we-want-to-tell-in-this-franchise-teases-director">Clair Obscur was a "franchise name"</a> and Expedition 33 was just one story within its universe.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We resolved to move forward with our original vision."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has said it was unwilling to backtrack on the design of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's controversial open world hub despite seeing "changed" attitudes to open-world games, as the project had already been rebooted once already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 blockbuster launched last month to mostly positive reviews, but also a broad swathe of criticism specifically for its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-metroid-prime-4-beyonds-annoying-initial-sidekick-is-revealed-a-fresh-trailer-confirms-other-npcs-will-join-samus-throughout-the-game">annoying supporting characters</a> and bland open-world desert hub where you ride around rather aimlessly on a motorbike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/60211" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Famitsu</a> (translated via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-famitsu-interview-with-nintendo-staff-regarding-metroid-prime-4-beyond-its-development-history-origins-its-placement-within-the-timeline-etc.1392244/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a> / <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/metroid-prime-4-developer-interview-origins-challenges/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Everything</a>), the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> development team has revealed that it struggled balancing Nintendo's desire to experiment with open-world gameplay with the Metroid series' core exploration, and ultimately had to stick to its original plan for the game rather than risk delaying it any further.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"At the start of the project, perhaps due to the influence of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, we saw a lot of comments on the internet saying 'we want to play an open-world Metroid,'" Nintendo said. (The interview does not label comments from individual developers by name.) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"However, Metroid's core element of 'increasing the amount of explorable areas by unlocking powers' is not very compatible with the 'freedom to go anywhere from the beginning' of open worlds," Nintendo continued. "Thus we thought to design a limited area that could be freely explored, and have that be a hub that could connect to other areas. Then we thought that if one could move around on the bike in a satisfying way in that area, it could be a segment that mitigates the tension from exploration, and paces the whole game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other words, the hub design seen in the finished Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was Nintendo's original compromise for including some open world elements while sticking to the franchise's core exploration in its main areas. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"In the end, the game took much longer than expected to finish, and we realized that players' impressions toward open-world games had changed," Nintendo added. "That being said, development had already been reset once before (when we started again from scratch with Retro Studios) so backtracking development again was out of the question, and we resolved to move forward with our original vision."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arriving 18 years after Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, the last game in Retro Studios' beloved Prime trilogy, Prime 4 was officially announced at E3 2017. Initially, Bandai Namco was put in charge of development, but development was rebooted in January 2019 back at Retro Studios after Nintendo decided the game's development had fallen short of expectations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo's comment that the open-world hub was part of its "original vision" for Prime 4 certainly suggests it was not Retro Studios' design, though the implication is that Nintendo only realized the flaws with it after the game's development was begun anew.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"During this time, shooting games and action games went through evolutions, with an increase in game speed in particular, but taking in those changes would have made it difficult to construct the tempo of an adventure game, so we actively chose to not take them into account," Nintendo concluded. "Therefore, I think this game is pretty much divorced from the changing of times."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea of Samus gaining psychic abilities also predated Retro Studios' reboot, and originated as an explanation for why she is now able to control the Charge Beam's directional shot. After Retro took over the project, Nintendo said it asked the studio to implement further gameplay features that expanded on the idea of Samus gaining a psychic power set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is an excellent, if relatively uneven, revival that reaches heights worthy of the Metroid name in its best moments," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review</a>, scoring the game 8/10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Deus Ex lead actor Elias Toufexis has branded the franchise's owners as "psychopaths," as the wait continues for a new entry in the dormant stealth action series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/2006498544270856318" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on X, Toufexis laid out his work schedule for 2026, which he said included Bungie's upcoming shooter Marathon and three unannounced projects. Of course, this tease prompted Deus Ex fans to suggest that at least one of these mystery projects was a long-awaited new Deus Ex sequel — something Toufexis was quick to shut down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"...no Deus Ex because the people in charge are psychopaths," Toufexis wrote. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Toufexis has been vocal in support of a new Deus Ex game materializing over the years, though it has now been a decade since the arrival of 2016's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deus-ex-mankind-divided">Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</a>. Developed by Eidos Montreal, the game arrived on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One to positive reviews. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But rather than develop a follow up, the next few years saw Eidos Montreal put to work on Square Enix's failed Marvel's Avengers live-service game, as well as its own take on Guardians of the Galaxy, alongside its continuing role as a support studio for the Tomb Raider franchise. With these franchises taking priority, Deus Ex fell by the wayside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fan excitement for a new Deus Ex was rekindled after Square Enix sold Eidos Montreal — and the Deus Ex franchise — to publisher Embracer, and indeed, a new game in the series was reportedly worked on for two years. Alas, this project was reported to have been canned in 2024, amid Embracer's widespread restructuring.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Deus Ex Concept Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"As you guys all know, Jensen is one of the characters I’ve played who is near and dear to my heart. It seems I will always be associated with him and that’s just fine with me," Toufexis wrote in a subsequent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Deusex/s/oIdy7dsQWv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> post, after word of the game's cancellation spread.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Alas, his story seems done. I’m relatively certain the game that was canceled was not an Adam Jensen story, so the cancellation angers me more than anything else because friends at Eidos got laid off. Video game companies right now are in a weird place. I hope it gets straightened out."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A year ago, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-deus-ex-game-pitched-by-eidos-montreal/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider Gaming</a> reported that Eidos Montreal was once again pitching an idea for a new Deus Ex title, though there was no suggestion this idea had been successful. Next up for the series will be Aspyr's recently-delayed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deus-ex-remastered">Deus Ex Remastered</a>, a polished up port of the franchise's original entry, which has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deus-ex-remastered-announced-with-february-2026-release-date">pushed from its original February 2026 launch date following fan concerns over its quality</a>. The project currently lacks a new launch window, and pre-orders have been refunded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Toufexis previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deus-ex-human-revolution-lead-was-canned-from-starring-in-far-cry-3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> he spent two years working on Far Cry 3, recording lines as the game's protagonist Jason Brody, before Ubisoft replaced him in the role. The voice actor claimed the reason for this switch was his work as the Deus Ex protagonist, whose voice had become too "popular" and recognizable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
