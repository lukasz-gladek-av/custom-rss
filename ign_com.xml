            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Small, portable and sometimes worth so much money that it would give even Pikachu a shock, rare Pokémon cards have increasingly become the target of theft and other crimes. Japanese news outlets <a href="https://www.sanspo.com/article/20250709-QQS2OJGSKJJSZHGC4N4NE3NY3E/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Sanspo</u></a> and <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-card-shop-robbed-of-valuable-cards-by-other-pokemon-card-shop-a-few-blocks-away/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a> recently reported that Pokémon cards and cash worth a combined total of 13,700,000 yen (approx. $92,000 USD, as per current exchange rates) were stolen from a trading card shop. The twist is that the third person arrested in this ongoing case is apparently the manager of a rival trading card store nearby.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The robbery happened on June 16 at around 3:30 a.m. at Card Shop Masters in central Japan’s Gifu Prefecture. Two men in their 30s were later arrested for breaking and entering. According to the Sanspo article, one of the men is suspected of threatening the owners with a knife before taking the cards and cash. On July 9, a third person, allegedly the owner of a nearby trading card store, was arrested on suspicion of being an accomplice in the robbery, although according to police, he has yet to confess or deny his involvement.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon TCG Mega Evolution</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The shop that was robbed has been posting about the situation on its X account, revealing the alleged identity of the third suspect as the manager of a rival store. They have also been appealing for information and calling for other people who were involved to give themselves up immediately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There’s no use thinking you won’t get caught. We will definitely catch everyone.” they said in <a href="https://x.com/MASTERS_gifu/status/1943158484863693250" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post</u></a> on July 10, which has since attracted over 1 million views. Commenters expressed sympathy with the victim, and shock that someone would rob a shop in the same line of work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Incidentally, there was a similar Pokémon card robbery that took place in Japan last year. Back in September, two men broke into a trading card seller in Osaka, also at 3:30 a.m. They threatened an employee (who had just been livestreaming a card sale) with a knife, tied them up and then took over 100 cards (worth over 10 million yen or around $67,000) as well as 250,000 yen (around $1,700) in cash (source: <a href="https://www.kochinews.co.jp/article/detail/783380" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kochi Shimbun</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rare Pokémon cards have become a target for heists in other countries too. In February, Australia’s <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-14/pokemon-card-store-melbourne-burglaries/104933558" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ABC News</u></a> reported on a string of Pokémon card thefts across stores in Melbourne. Just last week, a store in Massachusetts, USA, had more than $100,000 worth of cards stolen in an early morning break-in (source: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/13/us/pokemon-cards-stolen-massachusetts.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The New York Times</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by John Keeble/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

The studio described the expansion as a non-canonical side story to ARK in “an ambitious underwater setting featuring 95% of gameplay taking place beneath the surface."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ark-survival-evolved-fans-lash-expansion-trailer-filled-with-ai-generated-slop"><u>ARK: Survival Evolved expansion trailer released alongside the announcement was resoundingly condemned</u></a> after fans discovered evidence of generative AI imagery, and the follow-up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWTdUtQHRSg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>11-second trailer released last week</u></a> really didn't show us very much at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, however, a brand-new launch trailer is available to tempt you into picking up the expansion today. It shows off a selection of dinosaurs — both the aquatic and dry-land types — and how they exist alongside a tribe of humans, who can use their prehistoric companions to get around both on dry land and via what appears to be wind funnels beneath the waves.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not all of the creatures you bump into are friendly, though, so we're also treated to a little combat, too, as well as some truly stunning underwater vistas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ARK: Aquatica introduces the first submerged ARK with above-water islands, "challenging players with new survival mechanics, extreme environmental hazards, a huge explorable map area, and unique gameplay elements." The underwater biome adds 21 new tameable creatures, 74 new Engrams — including seven tek Engrams — and underwater survival thanks to features like air pockets and propulsion vehicles. Expect new characters and a "narrative connecting multiple ARKs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ARK: Aquatica is available exclusively on PC via Steam. For the first two weeks of release, players can pick it up for $8.99 — that's 40% off the recommended retail price. A new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/56353/ARK_New_Depths_Bundle" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ARK: New Depths Bundle</u></a>, which features both ARK: Survival Evolved and ARK: Aquatica Expansion Map, is also on sale at a 20% discount. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
