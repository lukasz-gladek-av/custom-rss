            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> is roaring ahead, with update 1.1.2.0 patch notes revealing that open beta aim assist settings are back, as are more weapon dispersion and bloom tweaks, as EA and Battlefield Studios roll out the next new Season 1 map: Eastwood.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest Battlefield 6 and REDSEC patch notes, which cover every change in tomorrow’s update, were listed in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-game-update-1-1-2-0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a new post on the project’s website</u></a>. It comes with a breakdown for all of the new weapons and features included with the long-promised mid-season update, as well as a shortlist of other major changes, including additional clarity for challenges, a “major polish pass” for gadgets, improved latency and stick response for controllers, a healthy dose of bug fixes, and much, much more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Aim assist is no doubt the headline for this week’s update and arrives as further proof that BF Studios plans to continue delivering on its post-launch promises. Those who tuned in for the Battlefield 6 beta tests in August will notice base aim assist settings will fall more in line with that build of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a U-turn from the launch version of the option, with the team explaining its original goal was to “make aim assist feel more effective beyond mid-range fights which was one of our focuses within Battlefield Labs and Open Beta.” Now, BF Studios admits those changes resulted in high-zoom aiming that was more difficult to control. Players can expect Battlefield 6 aim assist following update 1.1.2.0 to feel more consistent, steadier, and smoother.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After reviewing player feedback and gameplay data, we’re reverting aim assist back to the values some of you experienced during Open Beta and Battlefield Labs,” BF Studios says. “This will now serve as the default, whilst still providing you with the ability to alter the aim assist to your preference and playstyle via settings.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 fans should be happy to see more weapon dispersion and bloom tweaked further after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-1115-to-finally-fix-infamous-sledgehammer-drone-exploit-and-deliver-weapon-dispersion-tweaks"><u>update 1.1.1.5</u></a> changes resulted in positive feedback. While the previous patch tackled dispersion related to gunfire when aiming down sights after sprinting, tomorrow’s Season 1 update delivers a slight reduction to dispersion across the board. While each change suggests BF Studios is getting closer to reaching the smooth FPS experience they desire, Portal players can also look forward to more Portal tools in update 1.1.2.0, including the golf cart and a sandbox map option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the one-month-post-launch-mark in the rearview mirror, EA and BF Studios are moving steadily ahead with a level of communication that has kept its player base coming back for more Battlefield 6. Tomorrow’s update will make good on the promises made in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-outline-upcoming-aim-assist-and-weapon-bloom-adjustments-for-what-could-be-the-biggest-update-yet"><u>a community outline published by the developers last week</u></a>, but it’s clear there’s more work to do, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More weapon bloom tweaks, for example, are likely to arrive in the future as the team monitors feedback, with lighting adjustments, another promise from last week’s outline, absent from the 1.1.2.0 patch notes. These are upcoming changes in active development for Battlefield 6, but other hot topics, including map size, UI, player stats, hit registration/netcode, and more, are said to be under review for potential tweaks in the future.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The three-phase Battlefield 6 Season 1 launched with its first chapter, Rogue Ops, as well as the Blackwell Fields map, October 28, 2025. November 18 ushers in California Resistance, which comes with the 1.1.2.0 update, Eastwood, Sabotage limited-time mode, Rodeo mission for Gauntlet, DB-12 shotgun, M357 sidearm, Battle Pickups feature, and more. The final, major Season 1 update, Winter Offensive, will follow December 9, adding in more gameplay changes, a limited-time Ice Lock version of Empire State, and the ice climbing axe melee weapon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 update 1.1.2.0 launches November 18 at 1 a.m. PT / 4 a.m. ET.

We’ve also introduced a new limited-time mode, refined Aim Assist behaviour, and resolved a large number of weapon, gadget, and vehicle issues based on community feedback. The update will be available tomorrow, November 18th, at 09:00 UTC.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New Content: California Resistance</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>New Map: Eastwood. A map with the Southern California theme.<ul data-cy="list"><li>Variations of this map will be available for all official modes.</li><li>Conquest mode on this map will include tanks, helicopters, and the Golf Cart.</li></ul></li><li>New Time-Limited Mode: Sabotage. A themed event mode focused on demolition and counterplay.</li><li>New Weapons: DB-12 Shotgun and M357 Trait Sidearm. </li><li>Gauntlet mode to include a new mission type: Rodeo. This mission provides multiple vehicles for players to fight over and battle with each other with. Players earn bonus points for defeating enemies while in a vehicle. </li><li>New feature: Battle Pickups. These powerful weapons will be available in specific experiences and Portal with limited ammunition but pack enough firepower to help turn the tide of battle in your favor. </li><li>Portal updates: <ul data-cy="list"><li>Sandbox map. This option will let Portal experience builders start with a more level playing field to bring their imagination to life. </li><li>The Golf Cart vehicle is available for use in building experiences. </li></ul></li><li>Battle Pass: The California Resistance bonus path becomes available for a limited time. </li><li>New underbarrel attachment: Slim Handstop, unlocked via Challenge.</li><li>New feature coming later in the update: Battle Pickups.

Our goal was to make aim assist feel more effective beyond mid-range fights which was one of our focuses within Battlefield Labs and Open Beta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At launch, we increased slowdown at longer ranges, but once the game went live, we saw that this made high-zoom aiming feel less smooth and harder to control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After reviewing player feedback and gameplay data, we’re reverting aim assist back to the values some of you experienced during Open Beta and Battlefield Labs. This will now serve as the default, whilst still providing you with the ability to alter the aim assist to your preference and playstyle via settings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This change keeps aim slowdown consistent across all ranges, helping with muscle memory and providing a steadier, more reliable feel as we move into future seasons.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">CHANGELOG</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">PLAYER:</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Aim Assist: fully reset to Open Beta tuning, with related options reset to default to ensure consistency.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Vehicle Stick Acceleration Presets would affect Infantry Aiming Left/Right Acceleration option availability.</li><li>Fixed an issue where setting Stick Acceleration Presets to “Standard” would set the Aiming Left/Right Acceleration options incorrectly to 50% instead of 70%.</li><li>Fixed missing Infantry and Vehicle prefixes in captions for Stick Acceleration Presets and Aiming Left/Right Acceleration options.</li><li>Fixed an issue where stick deadzones would ignore the first 10% of movement if using a PS5 Controller on PC.</li><li>Fixed an issue where player movement (Left Stick) would not register until beyond 30% of travel past the deadzone.</li><li>Fixed joystick aiming input behaviour.</li><li>Added a short sprint “restart” animation when landing from small heights.</li><li>Added new death animations for sliding and combat-dive states.</li><li>Fixed a diving loop when entering shallow water.</li><li>Fixed an issue preventing players from vaulting out of water in certain areas.</li><li>Fixed an issue preventing takedown initiation against an enemy soldier if the enemy soldier already initiated a takedown against a friendly player.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a dragged player could face the wrong direction if turning quickly.</li><li>Fixed an issue where holding a grenade while jumping, sliding, or diving froze the first-person pose.</li><li>Fixed an issue where switching weapons while drag-reviving would break the reviver’s first-person view.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Assault Class extra grenade ability would not grant two grenades on spawn.</li><li>Fixed an issue where weapons could become invisible when crouching before vaulting.</li><li>Fixed bouncing behaviour when landing on object edges.</li><li>Fixed broken ragdolls when killed on ladders, while jumping, near ledges, or in vehicle seats.</li><li>Fixed camera clipping when dropping from height while prone.</li><li>Fixed clipping when initiating a drag &amp;

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"The rest is more detective work."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem's producer has attempted to address the persistent speculation that fan-favorite character Leon S. Kennedy will appear in the game, by branding a particular image as "fake news."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom continues to promote the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> as a new entry in the series starring fresh protagonist Grace Ashcroft, though has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">never explicitly stated that she is the sole playable character</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, when IGN sat down with Capcom at Gamescom 2025 in August, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-resident-evil-requiem-interview-why-the-games-monster-got-supersized-why-its-probably-not-lisa-trevor-and-a-tease-for-areas-beyond-raccoon-city-just-dont-talk-about-leon">we were told that its staff members would not discuss any internet rumors of certain other characters appearing</a>. But now, in an interview with <a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stevivor</a>, producer Masato Kumazawa has at least acknowleged the ongoing speculation — and confirmed one particular image is a fan creation. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil fans have recently been debating the veracity of an image shared widely on social media that features an older Leon with an eyepatch. Many had suggested the picture was likely AI-generated, and now, addressing this image specifically, Kumazawa has described it as "fake news."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Apart from any official information that Capcom has released, the rest is more [fan] detective work," Kumazawa said. "So I would suggest to please not take everything at face value. Considering that now is the time when AI [can be used to make] videos and photos, we don't know what's right or what's wrong. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Players are free to believe what they would like to believe," he continued, "what I'd like to tell is that, please, unless it's officially released from Capcom, we can't give you any confirmation."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Looking at this again, I think this leaked image of RE9 Leon is fake. The pupil in his eye is missing. The eyepatch is blurred and out of place. The hair strands is painted on. 🤔 <a href="https://t.co/KT43m1NOU2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KT43m1NOU2</a></p>— Paintixir (VGen) (@Paintixir) <a href="https://twitter.com/Paintixir/status/1969201826542067884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Another recent source of discussion among Resident Evil fans is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-deluxe-edition-includes-lady-dimitrescu-costume-for-grace-preorders-get-apocalypse-costume">labelling of DLC costumes for Grace Ashcroft found within the game's deluxe edition</a>. This pricier package advertises the fact it contains five additional costumes total, though only a couple for Grace have so far been showcased. As well as that, each in-game item is labelled with the "Grace's Costume:" prefix, something fans have excitedly suggested means that more costumes for other characters (Leon) are being held back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There has been a photo lately of Leon with an eyepatch, and just basically saying there's a DLC or a new costume for Leon," Kumazawa stated, "but just to make sure, these are all fake news."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, however, Capcom appears to have stopped short of saying Leon isn't in the game — and at this point, if he wasn't, you'd think its developers would want to set the record straight in order to start managing expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S — whether it includes Leon or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
