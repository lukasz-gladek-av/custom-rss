            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A nine-minute slice of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a>'s battle royale mode has leaked online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite presumably signing NDAs, participants in Battlefield's closed beta environment, Battlefield Labs, are continuing to share snippets of their experiences. This particular video from Misako_Mikato_01 on bilibili not only gives a good look at what to expect from the mode, but also reveals a couple of gameplay mechanics we didn't previously know about, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As highlighted on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n5ftcg/9_minutes_of_the_battlefield_6s_br_map_leaked/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</u></a>, <a href="https://streamable.com/ydlo9l" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Misako_Mikato's video</u></a> confirms players can swim, go underwater, and shoot from within the water, reveals the ladder gadget apparently has two modes — one as a ramp, another as a ladder — and there's a "massive map."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The video kicks off from when the player picks their loadout and departs the jumpship, landing in a built-up area on the shore. We see them swimming and later pulling out a sledgehammer to knock down what appears to be a public bathroom in real-time. Apparently the ruckus gets unwanted attention, though, although they seemingly sacrifice themselves to go back into the sky, this time moving in-land and visiting a fancy, if ransacked, villa. Cue the sledgehammer again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Commenters seem quite impressed by the video. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I know many Warzone players that will be happy to finally have a serious [battle royale] alternative," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n5ftcg/comment/nbsf0he/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a> one viewer. "This could, potentially, pull in a large amount of players. If they stay depends on how good it will be."

That destruction will make every game feel different."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6 Reveal After Party</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6's playtests have proven to be leaky indeed, though developer DICE has said it gathered "loads of feedback from the very active testers selected."
