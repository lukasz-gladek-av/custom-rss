            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-stream-friday-the-13th-movies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A streaming guide for the slasher saga.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">After the success of Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th kicked off the 80's by taking the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-slasher-movies">slasher genre</a> to gorey new heights. Jason Voorhees first appeared (sort of) to terrify teens at a Crystal Lake summer camp, and its safe to say the original Friday the 13th is essential viewing for any horror fan. 12 movies and 11 directors later, the hockey-mask wearing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-31-horror-movie-villains">horror villain</a> has become a zombie, gone to space, and battled a fellow slasher icon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those looking to watch or rewatch the films ahead of Halloween or the next Friday the 13th in December, here's where you can stream all of the Friday the 13th movies right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Watch the Friday the 13th Movies Online </h2><div catalogid="c47a9a39-a644-4b37-b515-8776ebd77b36" id="135369"><div id="135369" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>7 Days Free Paramount+ Free Trial</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Includes a 7-day free trial.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the years, the Friday the 13th movies have been pretty hard to find online. This October, the first eight Friday the 13th movies ("the original series," if you will) have finally found a home at Paramount+. The more recent films, including the 2009 reboot, are available to stream on Max. All of the Friday the 13th movies are available to rent or purchase from digital storefronts, which is unfortunately the only way to get your hands on Jason Goes to Hell (maybe that one's for the best) and Jason X. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Friday the 13th Movies on Blu-ray </h2></div><div catalogid="f986598b-93bb-4442-9838-53081531c46b" id="87884"><div id="87884" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Shout! Factory Friday the 13th Collection [Blu-Ray]</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Includes 16 discs with the original movies in HD, special features, audio commentaries and more.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Friday the 13th movies may be all over the place online, Shout!Factory released a collected set of all 12 movies on Blu-ray back in 2020. The set also includes what can only be described as a ludicrous amount of bonus features. If you don't need the Blu-ray or all those extras, you can also grab a <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wGJmp?object_uuid=c0a96dbc-3ecc-400f-8f4c-fe1e52e642dc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DVD set of the first 8 movies</a> for around $20. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Order Should You Watch the Friday the 13th Movies</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Friday the 13th franchise, like most of the 80's slashers, has a lot going on. We're talking spin-offs, reboots, crossovers, and some good ol' time travel. For those interested in the Jason timeline, we've also covered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-friday-the-13th-movies-in-order">how to watch the Friday the 13th movies in chronological order</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Will There Be More Friday the 13th Movies? </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While the 2009 reboot may have intended to bring back the series, complicated legal drama over franchise rights has stalled the production of any new Friday the 13th movies since. Instead, the biggest release the franchise has seen in the past 15 years was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/friday-the-13th-the-game">Friday the 13th: The Game</a>, which, due to more legal drama, was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/friday-the-13th-the-game-will-no-longer-be-available-to-buy-after-this-year">delisted at the end of 2023</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, we may finally get that 13th Friday the 13th movie. Earlier this year, Horror, Inc announced they would be working with some of the original license holders to build up a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jason-universe-horror-inc-announces-multi-platform-expansion-of-friday-the-13th-franchise">multi-platform Jason Universe</a>. Yes, of course that's what they're calling it. While the Jason-verse will seemingly kick off with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/friday-the-13th-prequel-series-finds-new-showrunner-following-bryan-fullers-exit">Crystal Lake TV show</a>, hopefully we see Jason back on the big screen sooner rather than later. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Blythe (she/her) is an SEO Coordinator at IGN who is always looking for the next great horror story and turn-based RPG.</em></p></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 25, 2024 1:30 am</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This setting will allow players to change the appearance of spider-like enemies in Zombies without affecting their game play."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/24/bo6-accessibility-image-005-1729814341666.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6's arachnophobia mode somehow seems even worse. Image credit: Activision.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The description is accompanied by a screenshot that shows a spider beast crawling toward the player on one side, and what it looks like when the arachnophobia mode is turned on. It seems the toggle simply removes the spider creatures legs, turning it into a floating torso that resembles a flying leech with huge, spiky teeth. In a word,<em> eww</em>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But hey, at least it's not a spider, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new feature is part of Black Ops 6's version of Zombies, the latest in a long line of games dating back to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-world-at-war">Call of Duty: World at War</a>. You can check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-the-zombies-preview">full Zombies preview right here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-amazon-deal-yakuza-show-premiere<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Time to hit the karaoke bars.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">With the recent success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: Refantazio</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>, it’s safe to say Sega is having a pretty good year. While those may be the final big game releases from the publisher in 2024, Sega officially caps off its year of releases with a TV show based on the Yakuza game series. That’s a cause for celebration, and, more importantly, some discounts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the new TV show Like a Dragon: Yakuza <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-like-a-dragon-yakuza-show">premiering today on Prime Video</a>, Amazon has dropped prices on most of the Yakuza games. The critically acclaimed turn-based RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> is at its lowest price yet. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">$40 Off Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth on PS5 or Xbox Series X</h2><div catalogid="a0712628-1cdf-4bf2-ada6-3589574b52ab" id="209660"><div id="209660" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is the most recent addition to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-games-in-order">Yakuza timeline</a>, and $40 off brings the game down to its <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CJHD3JZ8?" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest ever price</a>. In my experience, 60% off a same-year release of this quality is about as good as video game deals can get.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To clear up some confusion, the Yakuza series rebranded as "Like a Dragon" in English localizations back in 2022. If you’re an OG Yakuza fan, have no fear: The recent Like a Dragon games carry the spirit of the original PS2 series through and through. Here’s what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/tristan_ign_au">Tristan Ogilvie</a> had to say in his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">9/10 review of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>: </p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Yakuza Games on Sale</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a> (2020) and the spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-ishin">Like a Dragon: Ishin!</a> (2014) are also included in Amazon's deals. If you want to check out some of the OG Yakuza series, you're in luck. While not the same level of price slashing, the remastered collection of Yakuza 3, 4, and 5 is 25% off. The collection was released for the PS4 back in 2020, but because of the PS5's backward compatibility the games work on either console. Same goes for Yakuza Kiwami 2, a remake of the original Yakuza 2, which is also slightly discounted. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Preorders for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Are Still Full Price</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="73cb2eaf-df62-41ec-ac64-06de169b8249" id="207607"><div id="207607" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The one Like a Dragon game that isn’t on sale is, as you could probably guess, the one that isn’t out yet.
