Nintendo keeps these mature titles separate from its general N64 collection which includes more family friendly classics such as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, F-Zero X, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Top 10 N64 Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadow Man arrived in 1999 as a 3D Metroidvania where players take on the role of Michael LeRoi as he joins a lineage of spiritual warriors who protect the land of the living from supernatural threats. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/07/shadow-man-review">IGN's 1999 review awarded Shadow Man an 8/10</a>, saying "fans of dark storytelling and action hounds alike will find a lot to praise here."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Turok 2: Seeds of Evil was released a year earlier and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/12/12/turok-2-seeds-of-evil-2">earned a 9/10 in IGN's review</a>. "Turok 2 transcends framerate questions and delivers a great gameplay experience that will hook gamers if they put enough time into the game," we said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These games are available at no extra cost to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-release-date-pricing-n64-sega-games">users who have a Nintendo Switch Online membership and have purchased the Expansion Pass</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-early-access-release-date-pushed-to-december<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Path of Exile 2 Early Access release date has been pushed by three weeks <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-set-early-access-date-for-november">from November 15</a> to December 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Game director Jonathan Rogers appeared in a very apologetic X/Twitter video to announce the delay, saying he is "really sorry about this one" as he understands fans have booked time off work and so on based on the old release date. "But we just have to do it," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It isn't really the game itself that we're behind on, it's a bunch of server side infrastructure work that is taking us a lot longer than we expected," Rogers said. He explained he didn't realise how much work was involved in making both the original game and Path of Exile 2 compatible, so things like players' paid content isn't lost.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">In order to ensure a smooth launch, Path of Exile 2's Early Access will be delayed for 3 weeks. The new date is December 6th PST. Statement from Game Director Jonathan Rogers below. <a href="https://t.co/Bk8Ti8u94d" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Bk8Ti8u94d</a></p>â€” Path of Exile (@pathofexile) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathofexile/status/1851096646140166559?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"We have to get everything perfect so that nobody loses anything they paid for, and nobody has their account broken," Rogers said. "I actually believe that we could possibly have made the original launch date. but I'm no longer confident we could do it without making mistakes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those looking forward to Path of Exilies 2 can at least expect a stream with major updates in around four weeks, Rogers said, meaning roughly November 26.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Path of Exiles 2 is the sequel to the beloved free to play action role-playing game from Grinding Gear Games, coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC. Set years after the original Path of Exile, up to six player can return to the dark world of Wraeclast together and seek to end the corruption that is spreading.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-gets-better-every-time-i-play-it">IGN's previews of the game have been very positive so far</a>. "Based on what [we've] played over the last several months, this is shaping up to be a game you should not miss," we said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
