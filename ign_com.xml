"It’s now Funcom’s fastest-selling game ever. To put it into perspective, it took Conan Exiles one year to reach this number. We’re truly humbled and thankful for this reception. It must also be noted that you certainly don’t live up to your title, because you have been busy since launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Launch has been a Coriolis storm, and we’re still riding that mighty gale. We have seen so many amazing things from all of you — the bases, the close calls with Shai-Hulud, the epic vehicle jumps, the struggles, discoveries, victories, heroic deaths, and so much more... We salute you, Sleepers."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Within hours of going live, Funcom's survival RPG had clocked up over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-one-of-the-most-played-games-on-steam-as-peak-concurrent-player-numbers-hit-new-heights"><u>142,000 concurrent players on Valve's platform</u></a>, and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>hit a new high last weekend of 189,333 players</u></a>.

The survival climb from dehydrated peasant to powerful warlord of Arrakis is a joy almost every step of the way, and the story and worldbuilding filled this nerd with absolute joy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There’s still plenty for Awakening to work on though, as its combat never really hits its stride, the endgame is a bit of a chaotic mess not worth the effort, and there’s quite a few technical bugs yet to be squashed, but even these rough patches felt like tiny desert mice next to the leviathan shai-huluds that are this survival game’s wonderful successes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-developer-is-formulating-a-plan-to-improve-pvp-and-toxic-deep-desert-experiences"><u>Funcom is already "currently formulating a plan" to improve PvP in the Deep Desert</u></a>, which players have previously branded as "toxic" due to griefing.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Concept art from a long-canceled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman Arkham Knight</a> follow-up set to star Damian Wayne as the Dark Knight has surfaced online, giving us our best look yet at an aged Bruce.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Sabbath, as it was known, was in development at Batman Arkham Origins studio Warner Bros. Games Montreal after the launch of 2015's Arkham Knight, and would have featured two Batmen — father and son. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, however, the project was canceled by Warner Bros. and WB Games Montreal instead shifted focus to launch 2022's poorly-received Gotham Knights, a game with no Batmen at all. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Sabbath was planned as Warner Bros' next big Batman game, while Rocksteady itself explored concepts featuring other characters. Of course, Rocksteady itself circled back to its version of Batman (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-officially-ends-after-final-update-offline-mode-and-true-ending">sort of</a>) in its next project, the ill-fated Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Images from a former WB Games Montreal artist who worked on the project have now popped up on Artstation, featuring a youthful-looking Damian, grizzled and bearded Bruce, plus concepts for Killer Croc and Huntress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether this game would have been strictly part of the Arkhamverse canon has never been firmly established. On the one hand, some of the designs here — particularly a very different-looking Killer Croc — suggest this would have been something of a different take. That said, the same could be said of Poison Ivy's appearance in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which definitely was part of the Arkham-verse. And, of course, WB Games Montreal did make Batman Arkham Origins, a prequel that is considered canon to Rocksteady's core trilogy.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">New concept art from WB Games Montréal's cancelled 2015 Damian Wayne game "Project Sabbath" has surfaced, shared by character artist Rodrigue Pralier. The pieces clearly show Damian, an older Bruce, Killer Croc, and Huntress. The style and character designs further support the… <a href="https://t.co/aRwTD7caYE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/aRwTD7caYE</a></p>— Batman Arkham Videos (@ArkhamVideos) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamVideos/status/1936772762376315323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time concept art from the game has hit the internet. Back in 2021, another former WB Games Montreal developer posted images of Damian Wayne in his Batsuit — a sleek outfit with red Bat signal emblazoned on his chest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These designs also showed the same bearded older Bruce Wayne, although only inside his suit — meaning his newly-revealed face was obscured. Still, the designs suggest that, at some point, the older Bruce would still have suited up during his retirement. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>"Project Sabbath", a canceled Damian Wayne Batman game at WB Games Montreal, apparently has another wave of concept art revealed - this time by concept artist Goran Bukvic. The images match how the game was first described years ago.</p><p>Credit to Reddit user thebananapeeler2. <a href="https://t.co/TelAZeMVMj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/TelAZeMVMj</a></p></div>— The Arkham Channel (@ArkhamChannel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamChannel/status/1457904698166546438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 9, 2021</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">After launching Gotham Knights and providing additional development help to Rocksteady on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, WB Games Montreal was downsized in December 2024, with almost 100 jobs lost. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-confirms-its-pulling-the-plug-on-new-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-content-after-season-4">Rocksteady's attempt at a co-op game featuring Batman side-characters was a flop</a>, though the developer is now <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-working-on-single-player-batman-game-monolith-productions-wonder-woman-in-trouble">reportedly working on a single-player Batman game once again</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe this will end up finally being the Bruce and Damian Wayne game fans have been waiting for?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
