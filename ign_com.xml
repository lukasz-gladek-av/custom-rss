The superhero team are sitting in the Fantasticar, and we also see the Baxter Building in the background.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/02/mr-1735838364222.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Fantastic Four's design for Marvel Rivals.

One early question fans have is whether H.E.R.B.I.E. is playable alongside the main Fantastic Four members. We'll find out soon enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that the Fantastic Four image also includes what look like bats flying across a sky lit by a blood-red moon. Could this vampiric tease suggest Blade is coming in Season 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals is a smash hit for NetEase, securing 10 million players in just three days and 20 million in two weeks. The free-to-play superhero team-based PvP shooter launched on December 6 across PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, and while Sony and Microsoft do not make player numbers public, Steam makes Valve stats available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, Marvel Rivals peaked over its launch weekend with 480,990 concurrent players, which was enough to put it in the top five most-played games on Valve's platform. It’s the 20th highest concurrent player number ever seen on Steam, ahead of the likes of Helldivers 2, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Destiny 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals launched with Season 0, with Season 1 set for January 9, according to the in-game battle pass countdown timer. It seems likely Fantastic Four will be made available with the release of Season 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review"><u>Marvel Rivals Review</u></a> to find out what we think.

The issue was so bad that Microsoft updated its <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3448msgdesc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>support website</u></a> to reveal it has placed a temporary block on Windows 11 for users with those games installed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After installing Windows 11, version 24H2, you might encounter issues with some Ubisoft games," Microsoft said at the time. "These games might become unresponsive while starting, loading or during active gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In some cases, users might receive a black screen. The affected games are Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Assassin's Creed Origins, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Star Wars Outlaws, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To safeguard your Windows update experience, we have applied a compatibility hold on devices with these games installed. These devices will not be offered to install Windows 11, version 24H2 via the Windows Update release channel."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft released an update to fix the problem in Star Wars Outlaws and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, but Microsoft and Ubisoft are both still working to sort out the Assassin's Creed games, and frustration has finally spilled over into Steam user reviews.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Negative reviews for Assassin’s Creed Origins ramped up mid-December before hitting a peak as we crossed into 2025, with the game’s recent user review rating dropping to ‘Mixed.’ Overall reviews for the game remain ‘Very Positive.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pretty much all the recent negative reviews complain about the Windows update making Assassin’s Creed Origins unplayable. Until a resolution is found, Ubisoft told customers not to manually update to version 24H2 using the Windows 11 Installation Assistant or the media creation tool. If the game stops responding, you’ll need to use Task Manager to close the application.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft’s Windows problems have hit the company at a particularly troubling time. The company is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/days-after-shutting-xdefiant-and-laying-off-hundreds-of-staff-ubisoft-is-reportedly-considering-how-to-structure-a-tencent-buyout-without-the-guillemot-family-losing-control">reportedly in buyout talks with Chinese megacorp Tencent</a> after a torrid 2024 in which it closed studios, shut down games, and made mass layoffs. The company’s next big game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, was delayed into 2025 and Star Wars Outlaws failed to meet sales expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft’s shares fell to their lowest level in the last decade in September after it made a series of dramatic announcements around the performance of its games. As well as delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Ubisoft announced a return to Steam after a period of PC launch exclusivity on the Epic Games Store, with Star Wars Outlaws recently releasing on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
