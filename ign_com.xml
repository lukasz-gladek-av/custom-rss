A new storage system has 10 times the capacity of the regular Palbox. Not only can guild members access it, but it can be used as a personal storage with private settings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, you can now change your character’s appearance without affecting armor stats (transmog), there’s a photo mode, blueprint upgrading, and dedicated servers for Mac, among other changes detailed in the patch notes below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Pocketpair said it’s working on adding dedicated servers for the PlayStation 5 version and will release them at some point in the future.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld has had an incredible <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-hits-32-million-players-during-year-1-as-nintendo-pokmon-lawsuit-looms-over-the-horizon"><u>32 million players</u></a> since its early access launch in January 2024. The studio has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-crossplay-final-boss-and-more-coming-as-pocketpair-reveals-2025-roadmap"><u>laid out a content roadmap for Palworld's 2025</u></a> that looks fairly lengthy; alongside crossplay, there is an "ending scenario" and more new content on the way for the hugely popular creature-catching survival game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC a year ago, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-massive-profits-are-too-big-for-a-studio-with-our-size-to-handle"><u>couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated</u></a>. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>signing a deal with Sony</u></a> to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP, and launching the game on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looming over all this is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-officially-suing-palworld-developer-over-multiple-patent-infringements"><u>a lawsuit from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company</u></a>, who seek "an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages" on the grounds that Palworld has allegedly infringed on "multiple" patent rights. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-reveals-patents-at-the-heart-of-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-lawsuit-and-how-much-money-its-being-sued-for"><u>Pocketpair has provided an update</u></a>, identifying the patents the studio is allegedly infringing, and it has since tweaked how players summon Pals in Palworld, apparently in response. Pocketpair has vowed to take on Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in court, saying: “We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Palworld update 0.5.0 patch notes:</h2><div data-cy="paragraph"><p><strong>▼New Content</strong><br>・Crossplay!<br>⤷ Cross-play is now available across all platforms.</p><p>・Global Palbox<br>⤷ Store Pal data in the Global Palbox and transfer Pals between worlds!</p><p>・Dimensional Pal Storage<br> ⤷ A new storage system with 10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox!

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/x-men-dice-throne-is-a-board-game-that-makes-good-use-of-its-license</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/x-men-dice-throne-is-a-board-game-that-makes-good-use-of-its-license.1138500/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/x-men-dice-throne-is-a-board-game-that-makes-good-use-of-its-license<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel is everywhere these days, so it’s not surprising to see the deluge of heroes and villains represented throughout various media like the X-Men ‘97 show and Marvel Rivals video game. Even on the tabletop front, Marvel has seen its fair share of interesting crossovers with the likes of the team-based word game Codenames, and the long lasting trading card game Magic: The Gathering. Coming this Spring, there is yet another Marvel collab featuring the X-Men and the dice-rolling fighting game, Dice Throne. From what I’ve played so far, it’s very similar to past versions, but the new characters and unique abilities give this new X-Men run an interesting take for fans looking for a different kind of superhero tabletop experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new X-Men iteration of Dice Throne was initially on Kickstarter. So the Kickstarter version and the Battle Chest version that can be ordered on their website will have different contents than the retail versions that I was able to play with. These differences are mainly in the quality of the tokens and game pieces, in addition to better organizational improvements like storage trays for each hero. For the retail versions, there are two boxes to choose from showcasing four different X-Men each. One includes Cyclops, Gambit, Rogue, and Jean Grey while the other has Iceman, Psylocke, Storm, and Wolverine. So when deciding on which box to get into, you get a good blend of some fan favorites no matter what. Each character has a difficulty rank from one to six, which can be seen on the back of the box as well. The box with Wolverine and Storm is best for new players, since neither of the heroes have a difficulty over four. The Gambit and Jean Grey box, on the other hand, has both of these heroes in particular at difficulty six, so it’s best to consider your playgroup before choosing one or the other. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/dt-x-men-battle-chest-1742339226226.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Since this is ultimately Dice Throne, the gameplay is much the same, with each player rolling dice to determine what abilities their character will use on themself or their opponents or allies. Of the eight abilities on a character board, one of them is usually a defensive ability and another is a passive – alongside the other offensive abilities. On the center is the ultimate ability, which is of course very difficult to pull off being a game of chance. WIth each character board comes dice, a deck of cards specific to the character, dials for tracking resources, and associated character sheets with added information. It can take some time to understand a character’s abilities and the synergy between each one, but it all comes down to what you roll to decide what your turn will play out as. The deck of cards can assist you in manipulating your roll, but you can also alter your opponent’s roll if you decide to make an attack weaker or fizzle altogether. You’ll be taking turns rolling dice and bashing your opponents until they’re life hits zero. It’s pretty a straightforward goal, but how you get there is where the strategy comes in. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The more Wolverine is attacked, the stronger his attacks will be.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the basic gameplay is quite simple, the replayability really comes from the different characters you can pick from. Wolverine, for instance, has a fairly easy playstyle where he gains rage when taking damage. So the more Wolverine is attacked, the stronger his attacks will be. Then you have characters like Storm that can supercharge her abilities to have extra effects. She even has an ability to borrow dice from other players, so she has a better chance of rolling straights, like in poker, which are the cost of some offensive abilities. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel X-Men Dice Throne </h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking at the very difficult side of the character spectrum, there’s Jean Grey, who swaps back and forth between the Dark Phoenix, altering her passive abilities each turn. This means she’s drawing many cards and gaining resources one turn as Jean Grey, then skipping an entire phase but having higher offensive capabilities the next turn as Dark Phoenix. It can be difficult to balance depending on how your opponents affect your plays. Then there’s Gambit, another difficult character who kinetically charges cards with abilities to set up added effects on future turns. So keeping track of said charged cards and when to use them is another layer of strategy. Each character has their own flavor that matches their comic lore, so it’s just a matter of understanding their playstyle to make gameplay go smoothly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dice Throne can be played 1v1, but there are other options that the game suggests, like a free-for-all King of the Hill when there are an odd number of players, or even team matches. Since players take turns one at a time, games can last long if players aren’t quite comfortable enough yet, so playing 1v1 is a good way to get your feet wet before moving on to bigger parties. If you have experience with trading card games like Magic: The Gathering, Dice Throne will actually be pretty easy to pick up. Other than the dice rolls determining which abilities to use, the cards are used very similarly to other TCGs. For instance, there is a specific turn order like upkeep phase, income phase, main phase, and dice roll phases as well as the different timings for when cards can be used during either phase. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve seen Dice Throne before, but I’ve never really thought much of it whenever I find myself at the board game section of a store. Sure, dice-rolling games can be fun and interesting, but people will be drawn to whatever genres or game types they prefer. Being a fan of the Marvel universe and superheroes in general, this iteration of Dice Throne really brought me around to checking it out. If you enjoy Marvel characters and want a fun new board game to add to the library, X-Men Dice Throne really scratches that itch for board game nights – especially when your friends enjoy the characters and world as well. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
