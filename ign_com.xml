            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Get Battlefield 6 for free with purchase.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Dell is offering a competitive price on an <a href="https://zdcs.link/z62Dwl?object_uuid=405edafc-d4d6-4885-9111-9a89f236cc56&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alienware Aurora R16 gaming PC</a> equipped with the excellent Nvidia <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti">GeForce RTX 5070 Ti</a> graphics card during the Intel Gamer Days Sale. Right now you can configure one starting at just $1,699.99 with free delivery. The RTX 5070 Ti graphics card can run any game at 60fps even in 4K, including the upcoming Battlefield 6.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Alienware Aurora R16 RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC for $1,699.99</h2><div catalogid="a25177bf-886b-4d72-b109-40de6e2e9e15" id="223030"><div id="223030" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alienware Aurora R16 Intel Core Ultra 7 265F RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Th base configuration is equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 7 265F processor, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB graphics card, 16GB of DDR5-5600MHz RAM, and a 1TB M.2 SSD. The system is powered by a 1000W 80Plus Platinum power supply.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Core Ultra 7 265F is part of Intel's newest Arrow Lake-S lineup released earlier this year and boasts a max turbo frequency of 5.3GHz with 20 cores and a 36MB L2 cache. This is a great all-around CPU for gaming, multi-tasking, and general workstation performance. It doesn't have as many cores as a Core Ultra 9 processor, but that doesn't matter for gaming since the vast majority of games will not be able to utilize more than 20 cores. The processor is air cooled by a tower heatsink and fan combo, but you can upgrade to 240mm all-in-one liquid cooling for an extra $50.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The RTX 5070 Ti GPU Has Excellent 4K Gaming Performance</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all the Blackwell cards released thus far, the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck, especially when pitted against the previous generation GPUs. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. Like all Blackwell cards, the RTX 5070 Ti supports <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dlss-4-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-about-nvidias-latest-ai-upscaling-tech">DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation</a>.  This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution. If you plan on using this card for AI, the RTX 5070 Ti may be a better value since it has the same amount of VRAM as the RTX 5080.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">This deal is part of the Alienware Intel Gamer Days Sale </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Dell is participating in the annual Intel Gamer Days Sale with great discounts on Alienware gaming PCs and laptops featuring Intel Core Ultra processors and Nvidia GeForce Blackwell graphics cards.
