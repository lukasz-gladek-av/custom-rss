That's already the best price we've seen for the latest Zelda game for the Switch, but new Woot! customers can use $5 off coupon code "<strong>ZELDAWISDOM</strong>" to drop the price even further to $39.99. If you're an Amazon Prime member, you can also get free shipping, otherwise you'll have to pay $6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a physical copy and includes a 90-day Woot! warranty. The game box you receive may or may not be imported, which means there is a chance you might be receiving a PEGI or ESRB copy. Functionally it doesn't matter, since all Nintendo Switch games are region-free and you'll be able to play the game regardless. You won't have to worry about language either, since the language setting is determined by your Switch console, not the game disc.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</h2><div catalogid="007d5bf9-dc92-4652-8ad4-bf06bd9bfbbb" id="207939"><div id="207939" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (Switch)</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Code for for new customers only (otherwise $44.99)</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom review</a> and see why this game earned an "Amazing" 9/10 score. In it, writer Tom Marks states "The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is far greater than a gimmicky spinoff led by Zelda instead of Link. Its echo summoning is a clever concept used to combine the expertly crafted dungeons, puzzle rooms, and item progression you’d expect from a classic-style 2D Zelda with the borderline unhinged freedom provided by Tears of the Kingdom. This experiment doesn’t produce an entirely perfect result, with a little bit of clunky menu management and combat that simply isn’t quite as compelling, but it’s an impressively successful one all the same. Echoes of Wisdom is also a glowing proof of concept for how a modern 3D Zelda could recapture some of what fans like me miss about the series before Breath of the Wild without sacrificing the intoxicating creativity it introduced. Creating echoes aside, if this is the future of Zelda, I can’t wait to see more."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should you wait for Black Friday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We will absolutely see plenty more Nintendo Switch games on sale as we approach <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a>. There's a chance other vendors may drop the price of Echoes of Wisdom to $44.99. However, if you can get this game for $39.99, you should jump on it. I highly doubt you'll find any other retailer selling a physical copy of this game at that price, since it was released on September 26, less than two months ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more discounts on games, check out the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">best Nintendo Switch deals today</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
