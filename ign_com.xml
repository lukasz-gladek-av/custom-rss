That’s a staggering 122% markup, and with demand still outpacing supply, even Amazon has hiked its prices well above retail.</p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="218089"><div id="218089" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The availability is still good, as you’re not fighting bots or hoping your local store remembered to stock anything. This is probably your best shot today that doesn’t involve rolling the dice with potential scams through third-party sellers. Still, if you do decide to buy, do it with a fair warning that this is a heavily increased price. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">My Favorite Prismatic Evolutions Single Cards</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review">Prismatic Evolutions</a> is stacked. This is an Eeveelution collector’s dream (and a wallet’s nightmare). The Special Illustration Rare cards in this set are already climbing to jaw-dropping prices on resale sites.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The single card market, however, is a different story. Prices are slowly coming down, with Dragapult ex coming right down from over $100 to around $45 alongside Roaring Moon ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umbreon ex (161/131) is the crown jewel, going for a laughable $1,298 in lightly played condition. It’s absurd, but it’s exactly the kind of pull that justifies ripping packs like a gremlin. Sylveon ex (156/131) isn’t far behind, selling around $450 depending on condition, and Espeon ex (155/131) continues the psychic-type price madness with listings near $300. Some sellers are offering copies in the $90 range, but blink and those are gone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jolteon ex (153/131) brings the lightning with prices hovering around $265 for near mint, although listings under $100 do pop up — briefly. And then there's the rest of the Eevee family: Vaporeon, Flareon, Glaceon, and Leafeon ex are all pulling serious numbers, with some copies going well over $250, and even the “low” end listings still sitting in the $75–$100 range.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it’s not just about the Eeveelutions. Pikachu ex (179/131) might be one of the few heavy hitters in this set that’s still hovering under $100, currently around $70, but Pikachu is never a bad pull recently. Roaring Moon ex and Dragapult ex round out the list of top chase cards. Both are popular picks, with prices ranging from $45 to $200 depending on the condition and the whims of the secondary market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

That's smaller compared to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/Cyberpunk_2077_Download_Size">Xbox or PS5 (100-110GB)</a>, but for Switch 2, 64GB is a whopping 25% of the console's confirmed 256GB of internal storage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Launching on the same day as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-confirmed-during-nintendo-direct">Switch 2, June 5</a>, Cyberpunk 2077 will be available as a physical 64GB game card or as a digital download from the Nintendo eShop. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo also recently confirmed that several new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-game-cards-will-only-include-a-download-key">Switch 2 game cards won’t always carry an actual game</a>, but instead contain a key for a game download. This isn't the case for Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, this also begs the question: how quickly will a Switch 2's internal storage fill up?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-supports-120fps-up-to-4k-resolution-docked">Switch 2's 256GB internal storage</a> is a big step up from the original Switch’s 32GB. However, early signs already suggest Switch 2 games will be much larger. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077, like we've mentioned, is a 64GB download. By comparison, one of the biggest games on the original Switch, Tears of the Kingdom, was just 16GB. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-nintendo-switch-games-are-getting-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-including-breath-of-the-wild-and-metroid-prime-4">Switch 2 version</a>—and other titles like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-costs-80-30-cheaper-if-you-buy-it-bundled-with-the-nintendo-switch-2">$80 Mario Kart World</a>—will likely demand significantly more space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The obvious solution? Expandable storage. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-ssd">PS5 has it</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssds-for-xbox-series-xs">Xbox has it</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-sd-cards-for-nintendo-switch">Switch has always supported it</a>. But unlike the original Switch, which accepted standard microSD, microSDHC, and microSDXC cards, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-game-cards-will-only-include-a-download-key">Switch 2 is locked to microSD Express</a>. That means your old microSD cards won’t work, and more importantly, you’ll need to buy new, notably pricier memory cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can tell, IGN’s deals team has already tracked down the best prices on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-microsd-express-cards-where-to-buy">Switch 2-compatible microSD Express cards</a>, including <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPp5EV?object_uuid=c261c5f9-8f6b-4fb0-95dc-698a4c23b7b8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">128GB</a> ($44.99), <a href="https://zdcs.link/aewqoJ?object_uuid=c261c5f9-8f6b-4fb0-95dc-698a4c23b7b8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">256GB </a>($49.99), <a href="https://zdcs.link/9lXGRE?object_uuid=c261c5f9-8f6b-4fb0-95dc-698a4c23b7b8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">512GB</a> ($99.99), and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPp55W?object_uuid=c261c5f9-8f6b-4fb0-95dc-698a4c23b7b8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1TB versions</a> ($199.99) options from SanDisk and Lexar. However, some are already being snapped up in bulk and are now listed as "temporarily out of stock" on Amazon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is also partnering with <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5Yoxx?object_uuid=c261c5f9-8f6b-4fb0-95dc-698a4c23b7b8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SanDisk and Samsung to release its own branded cards</a>, though if history is any indication, expect them to be more expensive than identical third-party versions. It’s also possible more manufacturers will jump into the microSD Express market now that the Switch 2 is driving demand, but whether that leads to lower prices remains to be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Switch 2, you can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">everything from the Nintendo Direct right here</a>, and read our full guide on how to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-start-time">secure your preorder for the Switch 2</a> on April 9.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Senior Editor, Commerce, for IGN.
