            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Glen Schofield, who co-created <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space-2008"><u>Dead Space</u></a>, co-founded Sledgehammer Games, and most recently directed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-callisto-protocol"><u>The Callisto Protocol</u></a>, said "it's tough out there" in the games industry, and admitted he had potentially "directed my last game" after failing to secure financial support for his latest prototype. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a candid post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_game-industry-its-tough-out-there-activity-7354611327878774785-mvzk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>LinkedIn</u></a>, Schofield said he'd been working with his "great artist" daughter, Nicole, who went to him with an idea for a new horror game — maybe even a new horror sub-genre, although he didn't specify what — and had been working on the idea for the last eight months. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside a "small, talented crew" of six U.S. devs and a "full crew" in the UK, Schofield said he started talking to people, most of whom "loved the concept." Initially surmising he'd need around $17 million, the director was advised to lower the budget to "get it to $10 million," before being told to further streamline the project to come in at around "$2-5 million."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"So last month, we decided to walk away. Some ideas are better left untouched than done cheap," Schofield wrote. "We had a team of six here in the States and a full crew in the UK. Now, everyone’s looking for work. They’re all talented folks — if you’re hiring, let me know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As for me — I’ve worked on games of every size. From two of us to over 300 devs. Spent the last 15–20 years making big AAA titles with great teams. That’s what I do. That’s what I love. But with the industry on pause, AAA feels like it’s a long ways away." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Schofield says he's "back to [his] art," but admits he misses AAA development. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I miss it all; the team, the chaos, the joy of building something for fans. I’m still around, making art, writing stories and ideas, and still cheering the industry on. But maybe I’ve directed my last game. Who knows? If so, thank you [for] playing my games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Striking Distance was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/26/dead-space-creators-new-studio-to-develop-pubgs-narrative-experience"><u>founded over six years ago</u></a> by Schofield. The studio is a subsidiary of Krafton, the parent company that owns the rights to the widely popular battle royale game PUBG. The studio was initially formed to create a narrative-driven game set in the PUBG universe, but ultimately released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-creator-reveals-new-sci-fi-survival-horror-the-callisto-protocol"><u>The Callisto Protocol</u></a>, a third-person survival horror separate from PUBG that released in December 2022.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Callisto Protocol was met with mixed reviews and plagued with problems, from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-callisto-protocols-steam-reviews-suffer-following-reports-of-poor-performance"><u>performance issues</u></a> to reports of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-former-striking-distance-developers-say-key-folks-were-left-out-of-credits"><u>studio crunch</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-striking-distance-reportedly-left-several-developers-off-credits"><u>issues with crediting people</u></a> who contributed to the development. Roughly a month after release, it was reported that the game failed to meet Krafton's sales expectations, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-leaves-the-callisto-protocols-striking-distance-studios"><u>Schofield eventually left the company in September 2023</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We thought The Callisto Protocol was 'Good,' <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-review"><u>awarding it a 7/10 in our review</u></a>, writing: "The Callisto Protocol is a satisfyingly gory spiritual successor to the Dead Space series, but it’s ultimately more of a striking modern mimic than a scary new mutation."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Both Black Bolt and White Flare have made a huge impact since launching together on July 18, 2025. Celebrating the full Unova roster, these <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon TCG</a> sets stand out not just for gameplay but also for their pure focus on the beloved Gen V. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While every card in the expansion has an Illustration Rare or better, a few have emerged as both highly collectable and competitively viable. As a result, some cards have been selling out more over at dedicated card marketplace <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/pokemon/sv-black-bolt?productLineName=pokemon&amp;setName=sv-black-bolt&amp;productTypeName=Cards&amp;page=1&amp;view=grid" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCGPlayer</a> than others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s dive into the standout cards and the artwork that have collectors scrambling for singles.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR – The 10 Most Popular Cards From Black Bolt</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Bolt’s top sellers blend power, nostalgia, and jaw-dropping art, also sharing some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/most-expensive-black-bolt-white-flare-pokemon-cards-right-now">most expensive cards in White Flare and Black Bolt</a> too. N’s Plan leads the Trainer hype with a serene illustration. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Zekrom ex shows up three times, with the coveted Black White Rare version being the most in-demand — and expensive — of them all. Air Balloon’s reprint is a clean, functional favourite, and Genesect ex is a collector and/or competitive player’s dream with three sleek variations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seismitoad’s psychedelic Round set-up adds both charm and synergy. And then, further down, Victini’s bold Black White Rare print rounds out the list as a fiery sleeper hit. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">N’s Plan – 170/086</h2><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225973"><div id="225973" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>N's Plan - 170/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Illustrated with a striking close-up, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJP31?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">N’s Plan</a> is a simple but impactful Supporter card that lets you move up to two Energy from your Benched Pokémon to your Active. It’s already seeing experimental play for energy manipulation combos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real reason collectors are eyeing it, however, is the artwork. Featuring N against a glowing night fairground, this is one of the most beautiful Trainer cards in the set. It captures a rare moment of peace and nostalgia for its deeply tied scene in the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-black-version">Pokémon Black</a><em> &amp; </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-white-version/walkthroughs">White</a> games — set on that same ferris wheel in the background, with N revealing that he is actually the king of Team Plasma.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">N’s plan is also available as an <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmnWXy?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Uncommon and Secret Rare</u></a>, but this is the version everyone wants in their collections.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Zekrom ex – 034/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225972"><div id="225972" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zekrom ex - 034/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the three varities of <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBgXAM?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zekrom ex</a> on this list, this one might be the most aggressive-looking of the bunch. It shares the same stats and moveset but showcases Zekrom mid-roar, bolts of lightning wrapping around its frame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a card that goes all-in on intensity — the pose, the expression, the thunder. It’s easy to see why it’s become a standout for players who want their decks to look as powerful as they play. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Air Balloon – 079/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225971"><div id="225971" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Air Balloon - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A reprint of a beloved Tool card, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgPjw?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Air Balloon</a> reduces a Pokémon’s retreat cost by two Energy. It sees regular play in many decks thanks to its versatility, but this version’s value is bumped by its clean and nostalgic look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The illustration is simple but effective, with a bright red balloon floating in an airy green background. It evokes early Pokémon art styles with its softness and clarity, and longtime fans are snapping it up fast.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Genesect ex – 169/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225970"><div id="225970" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Genesect ex - 169/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The most expensive take on <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJPRY?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesect ex</a> in the set, this Special Illustration Rare version leans darker with a more industrial setting. Framed by black and crimson tones, the artwork gives the impression of a covert mission or even a monster movie scenario. It still offers Metallic Signal and Protect Charge, but the mood here is more intense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is arguably the most atmospheric of the Genesect trio. It’s one of those cards that gives hints of a chilling story, as well their being a stylish addition to their decks. On the other hand, with there being cheaper options, it’s good to keep this pricey card at least in a top loader if you want to retain its value. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Genesect ex – 161/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225969"><div id="225969" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Genesect ex - 161/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmnWpK?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesect ex</a> appears again as a radiant, glossy Secret Rare. All the same play value from its ability and attack, but now clad in reflective armour with dynamic camera angles — looking like a pure weapon ready to fire.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes this one desirable is its futuristic sheen. It’s mechanical but elegant, and some collectors seem to prefer the balance between high-tech precision, bold colour use, and being slightly more budget-friendly than the Special Illustration Rare.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Zekrom ex – 166/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225968"><div id="225968" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zekrom ex - 166/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Special Illustration Rare <a href="https://zdcs.link/a03ZGE?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zekrom ex</a> shares the same devastating Voltage Burst attack and utility-focused Slash of the earlier Double Rare, but is elevated by its the thunderstorm backdrop. Lightning crackles around Zekrom in a dynamic battle pose that sells its raw, storm-born power.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to the below Black White version, this one is all about motion and energy. It’s a favourite among players who want a flashy yet functional attacker, and it stands as a reminder that good art can enhance competitive cards without compromising on impact. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although its current $200+ market price may make you want to get this one PSA-graded instead.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Genesect ex – 067/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225967"><div id="225967" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Genesect ex - 067/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q47dOd?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesect ex</a> is function-first, but its standard foil still makes it pop. What makes this card playable is the featured Metallic Signal Ability, searching for two Evolution Metal Pokémon every turn — and Protect Charge, which hits for 150 and reduces incoming damage by 30 next turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it’s not the flashiest version of Genesect, the vibrant swirls of metallic pink and white light that frame the Pokémon give this card a sense of speed and energy. Most importantly, it’s the most affordable for those who want to slot this into a deck.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Seismitoad – 105/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225966"><div id="225966" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Seismitoad - 105/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Illustration Rare of <a href="https://seismitoad/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seismitoad</a> is not only one of the most psychedelic prints in White Flare, but it also has real deck-building potential. Its Round attack does 70 damage for each Pokémon you control with the same attack, meaning it scales dangerously with board set-up. Add in Hyper Voice at 160 damage and you’ve got a hefty Stage 2 option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the artwork certainly has a wow factor too. With swirling, trippy patterns and an oddly serene expression, Seismitoad looks like it wandered into a Beatles album cover. It’s colourful, weird, and unforgettable. With it being #3 among Black Bolt’s best sellers on TCG Player, that aesthetic flair has pushed this card into top-tier collector territory.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Victini – 172/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225965"><div id="225965" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Victini - 171/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Victini’s White Flare Black White Rare edition has become a surprise high roller. At first glance, it’s easy to underestimate. After all, 80 HP on a Basic doesn’t scream value. But a real kicker is its attack, V-Force, which hits for 120 damage with just two Fire Energy; if you have five or more Benched Pokémon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Fire swarm decks, that’s not hard to hit, making this a shockingly good closer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, this <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAk6b?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Victini’s</a> is cemented most of all by its unique presentation. This Black White Rare treatment uses deep reds and a minimalist embossed foil that makes Victini feel like a mythic figure, despite its size. It radiates heat, charm, and just enough menace to make you look twice. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Zekrom ex – 172/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225964"><div id="225964" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zekrom ex - 172/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The top seller among TCG Player Pokémon cards in Black Bolt, this Black White Rare <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GD22?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zekrom ex</a> combines raw power with prestige. Like the others Zekroms in this list, Voltage Burst attack starts at 130 damage and gains +50 for each Prize card your opponent has taken, creating late-game knockout potential. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 30 recoil damage is offset by Zekrom’s chunky 230 HP and synergy with Lightning acceleration like Miraidon or Flaaffy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The monochrome foil art makes it one of the most imposing cards in the set, alongside the above Victini. Rendered in elegant grayscale on an imposing pure-black background, Zekrom’s jagged lines and fierce pose turn it into a poster-worthy collectable. It’s a card that hits hard in play and even harder in your binder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.
