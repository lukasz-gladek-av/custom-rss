            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-declares-victory-the-battle-of-super-earth-is-won-what-next-for-the-illuminate<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2’s ongoing Galactic War appears to have reached another turning point, with the Federation declaring victory over the Illuminate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Illuminate have retreated from Super Earth battlespace,” reads the in-universe message to the game’s community. “The Heart of Democracy has been defended. The Battle of Super Earth is won.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Illuminate’s invasion certainly took its toll on Super Earth, with only two Mega Cities left standing: Prosperity City and Equality-on-Sea.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Remaining Illuminate forces were last observed making FTL jumps from Super Earth orbit,” the message continues. “The enemy has also vacated New Haven, Pilen V, and Widow's Harbor, burning the surface of those planets as they fled. No stations detect Illuminate forces — the enemy has gone into hiding. They will be found.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After days of nonstop fighting, Super Earth stands. The mettle of Managed Democracy has been tested; the will of the people has overcome the enemy. The Helldivers have achieved victory.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing is, no-one actually believes the Helldivers have achieved a long-lasting victory here. As is developer Arrowhead’s way, Federation communication is by default propaganda, and further turmoil is almost certainly coming down the pipe. And players really want to chase the Illuminate as they retreat, potentially to their home planet to stamp them out for good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, an in-game message revealed the President of Super Earth was killed while fighting back the Illuminate forces. But again, there was a healthy dose of scepticism from players, with some saying it might have been an Illuminate communication in disguise. What’s really going on here?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Helldivers 2 suffered a controversy this week surrounding the invasion, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-gets-review-bombed-again-this-time-over-its-big-battle-for-super-earth">leading to a fresh flood of negative reviews</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the days since the Heart of Democracy update went live, players have fought to hold the various Mega Cities of Super Earth, which correspond to major cities in real-life. York Supreme, for example, corresponds roughly to New York, and Remembrance to Buenos Aires. As the invasion continued, more and more cities fell, leaving only Equality-On-Sea (Shanghai) and Super Earth's capital, Prosperity City (Stockholm) standing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Efforts rallied behind Equality-On-Sea to make a last stand. But Equality-On-Sea never hit 100%; the current arc closed with the cities' percentage meter at 99.9783%. Many of the negative reviews are in Chinese, and while the machine translation doesn't seem accurate enough to quote, there are some recurring points one can easily glean: frustration over driving the narrative, the perception of a thumb on the scale from Arrowhead, and repeat mentions of "99.9783%."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s next? Well, for a start, the Federation needs a new president. Let’s see what Game Master Joel has up his sleeve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-toughest-challenge-so-far-finding-friends-to-play-with<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s early days for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, but already players have run up against their toughest challenge so far. No, it's not a classic FromSoftware boss, it’s the struggle to find friends to play with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign drops players into the shifting lands of Limveld, exploring and fighting for survival either solo or in groups of three. There is no way to play two-player co-op. We’ve already reported on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-massive-steam-launch-tarnished-by-mixed-user-reviews-over-lack-of-duos-co-op-voice-chat">Elden Ring Nightreign’s ‘mixed’ Steam user review rating</a>, with most of the complaints revolving around a lack of a duos option as well as no voice chat.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing Elden Ring Nightreign solo is proving to be a particularly difficult experience. As explained in IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign review</u></a>: "Let’s get the most important caveat out of the way first: if you are hoping to tackle Nightreign entirely solo, and are anything less than a hardcore Elden Ring player that actively seeks out ways to make that already difficult game even more challenging, Nightreign isn’t for you. Yes, there is technically a single-player option, but it is so poorly balanced that I would be shocked if it isn’t patched and adjusted within the first month of release. And this is coming from someone who lives and breathes these types of games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, solo players are faced with matchmaking with random players, which itself is presenting problems because of a lack of coordination required to defeat Elden Ring Nightreign’s bosses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, players are turning to the Elden Ring community for help. The Elden Ring subreddit, for example, is packed with requests from duos looking for a third player (yes, the community is having fun with this situation).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There’s like a zero % chance I’d find one other person to play with much less two,” said redditor trickponies. “Is the game even worth it solo?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are pointing out that Elden Ring Nightreign does have matchmaking, so you can play trios if you do not have friends to play with. But, as others have countered, playing this game with randoms isn’t always the best experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have seen too many videos on this sub to trust randoms with anything more than the newspaper,” said one player. “I love you all. But from a distance. My blood pressure can only take so much.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are turning to Discords and other online platforms as they hunt for like-minded fans to team up with. Elden Ring Nightreign hasn’t even been out 24 hours, but this is proving to be a big hurdle for the community as they work their way through the game.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Nightreign solo cuz my friends have a 9 to 5 and I'm unemployed <a href="https://t.co/t47UrYoDSv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/t47UrYoDSv</a></p>— Raph (@RaphDeee) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaphDeee/status/1928074268279026068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Some Elden Ring fans are even saying they won’t buy the game because they don’t have any friends to play with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, as disappointing as it is, Imma have to pass on this game, purely because I don't have any friends to play it with and I can't play solo,” said Twinkie454.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are calling on FromSoftware to rebalance the solo experience so it’s more manageable. “We'll see what FromSoft does to re-balance it, so maybe have some patience,” one person said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, as you’d expect, some fans are offering to help others out. “.... Did we just become best friends?!” said one Elden Ring player. “Get the game bestie, I'll see you tomorrow when I get off work!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite these issues, Elden Ring Nightreign has enjoyed a massive launch on Steam, with an incredible 313,593 peak concurrent users on Steam overnight. That was enough to make Elden Ring Nightreign one of the most-played games on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it sounds like FromSoftware may add a duos option at some point in the future. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first"><u>IGN's interview with Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki</u></a>, the Nightreign lead developer discussed the choice to lean on solos and trios as the core experience options. When asked why there's no option for a pair of players to drop in together without a matchmade third player, Ishizaki said it was overlooked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that," said Ishizaki. "As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start," Ishizaki continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed. So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well."</p><div id="top-25-fromsoftware-bosses" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3><h3>Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks">Nightreign tips and tricks</a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides">all the eight Nightlord Bosses</a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes">Nightfarer Classes</a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant">How to Unlock the Revenant</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess">How to Unlock the Duchess</a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters">How to Change Characters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Grace was reportedly credited as outsourcing and co-dev lead, although it's unclear if she has personally donated this plaque, or if it was somehow lost and donated when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown"><u>PlayStation shut down developer Firewalk Studios towards the end of last year</u></a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord, a live service hero shooter from Sony-owned Firewalk Studios, has gone down as one of the biggest flops in PlayStation history. Amid disastrously low player numbers, Sony pulled Concord offline just two weeks after launch. One estimate suggested it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"><u>only sold around 25,000 copies</u></a>. At the time, we awarded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-review"><u>Concord a 7 in our review</u></a>, writing: "Concord isn’t the most innovative or content-heavy hero shooter you could play, but with such fantastic competitive gameplay, 16 compelling characters to master, and 12 well-designed maps, it’s got the makings of something that could go the distance in the months and years to come."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're thinking a plaque like this could be worth something for collectors and fans alike, you're not wrong. So far, it's attracted dozens of bids and is, at the time of writing, <a href="https://shopgoodwill.com/item/231642470" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sitting on an asking price of $3,002</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/concord-devs-commemorative-plaque-hits-auction-the-price-is-already-soaring-3206903/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Dexerto</u></a>). The money will go to <a href="https://shopgoodwill.com/home" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Goodwill</u></a>, which helps people improve their lives by assisting them to find jobs and grow their careers. So far, it's served more than 25 million people.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/5a57ee30-4b46-4705-aace-aab35d664e87icar-05271-1748605118765.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Tim Miller, the chief creator of Amazon’s upcoming Prime Video animated anthology <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/secret-level"><u>Secret Level</u></a>, spoke out for the first time on Concord's closure last November, saying: "I honestly don’t understand why it didn’t work. I know that they were trying to do the best they could, and they were a talented group of artists, so I feel terrible for that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has proved a costly failure for Sony. Concord's initial development deal was around $200 million but sources familiar with the agreement say the $200 million was not enough to fund Concord's entire development, nor did it include the purchase of the Concord IP rights or Firewalk itself. It's thought ProbablyMonsters — Firewalk's original parent company — raised $200 million in 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
