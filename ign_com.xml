This is a bit later than players expected to see the season begin, however, as the countdown on the current Battle Pass was suggesting a reset on March 20.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have high hopes for season 3. Activision has been teasing the return of the beloved Verdansk map <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-is-finally-returning-to-call-of-duty-warzone-and-fans-are-delighted">for some time now</a>, and has set expectations for its arrival sometime this spring. Just yesterday, a pop-up in the Call of Duty shop suggested "The Verdansk Collection" <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mark-your-calendars-warzone-fans-call-of-duty-merch-shop-teases-were-dropping-back-in-to-verdansk-next-week">would arrive on March 10</a>, likely heralding the map's triumphant return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll have to hang tight for more details on the season next week, as it seems likely an overview of what to expect from the season will appear at roughly the same time as "The Verdansk Collection" on the 10th. For now, we can content ourselves with season 2, which added five multiplayer maps, the return of Gun Game mode, new weapons and operators. and a<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activisions-costly-call-of-duty-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-crossover-has-some-players-saying-black-ops-6-should-just-go-free-to-play-at-this-point"> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles crossover event</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
