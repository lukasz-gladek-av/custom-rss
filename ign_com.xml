            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Early copies of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> have been glimpsed in the wild — meaning it is now time to take action to avoid spoilers, fans have warned, such as the ultimate fate of Leon S. Kennedy in Capcom's hugely anticipated game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Requiem has been pitched by Capcom as a special title in the series — one that returns to the franchise's origins to wrap up long-standing plotlines and feature fan-favorite characters — such as Leon, of course, but also what appears to be Sherry — as part of a much-anticipated return to Raccoon City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the franchise celebrates its 30th anniversary, Resident Evil Requiem is believed by some fans to likely be the final time we see or play as some of these characters, as Capcom moves its franchise forward. (Also, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/women-in-particular-were-pretty-strict-when-reviewing-his-design-resident-evil-requiem-director-says-hot-uncle-leon-s-kennedy-has-many-fans-at-capcom">hot uncle Leon</a> is one thing, but hot grandad Leon seems less believable.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All of which is to say that there's a particular level of concern around Resident Evil Requiem plot leaks — with some fans now saying they will be avoiding social media fully for the foreseeable future. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can personally verify there is at least one person out there who bought Resident Evil Requiem from a store selling early," wrote noted Resident Evil leaker <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2023701578654642421" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dusk Golem</a>, who repeatedly stated that Leon was in the game months before Capcom made it official. "Funnily enough someone I vaguely know &amp; have talked to a few times, no spoilers out there yet but brace yourselves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The account then shared a link to an image of a boxed PlayStation 5 copy of Resident Evil Requiem, seemingly out in the wild. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I can personally verify there is at least one person out there who bought Resident Evil Requiem from a store selling early, funnily enough someone I vaguely know &amp; have talked to a few times, no spoilers out there yet but brave yourselves.<a href="https://t.co/xoDURKOWVw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/xoDURKOWVw</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2023701578654642421?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 17, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">As ever, the best advice to avoid spoilers is simply to avoid the internet as much as you can before next week, but particularly to be careful of YouTube and Twitch comments where people spread spoilers in chat. Muting keywords on social media is also recommended. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem's February 27 release date is now just 10 days away, and we'll be keeping spoiler free here on IGN as much as possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After getting hands-on with a total of about four hours of Resident Evil 9 Requiem at this point, and sharing that experience with colleagues, I’m more excited for the series than I have been in recent memory," IGN wrote after going <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-second-take-preview">hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem</a> recently. "It’s the old mixed with the new, but all in a modern package with two protagonists I already like a lot."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
