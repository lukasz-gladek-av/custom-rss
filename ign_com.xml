However, as you get stuck into the game's dice-rolling collectathon grind, you'll likely start wondering if there are any redeemable codes to give you a leg up in building your aura arsenal. We've put together this page to give you all the details on the game's status regarding redeemable codes.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/03/roblox-sols-rng-header-1733263408082.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Are There Any Active Sol's RNG Codes?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, there are currently <strong>no codes for Sol's RNG</strong>. There's no word on whether redeemable codes are a feature the team behind the game intends to eventually add, but if and when they are added, we'll update this page with all the details.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where Can I Check For Sol's RNG Codes?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to check for updates on whether codes have been added to Sol's RNG, your best bet is to join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/solsrng" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game's official Discord server</a>. As we mentioned earlier, there are currently no codes or even a method to input them, but if that changes, the developers are likely to make an official announcement in the server's <strong>announcements channel</strong>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Sol's RNG in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sol's RNG is one of the most popular RNG games currently on Roblox. After dropping in, you're able to roll a dice, with each roll adding new auras to your collection.

It comes with a new Gingerbread Hourly Spin and a special festive crate alongside a host of bug fixes, new swords, emotes, and more. It’s unclear exactly how long the Festivities Update-related goodies will be live, so make sure you start getting those spins in sooner rather than later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Festive Crate can be found in the lobby and grants access to specific rewards. Wiggity didn’t reveal everything the crate can hold and instead teased just one item: an OP-tier sword called Northstar Reaper. Players who advance to the Gingerbread wheel’s center, meanwhile, will be rewarded with the OP-tier sword, Frostbane.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/04/blade-ball-2-1733275545667.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Blade Ball Festivities Update adds new features, bug fixes, and more.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Blade Ball’s latest update also comes with changes to a few abilities. The team says Calming Deflect and Quantum Arena have both received buffs, while Dragon Spirit, Swap, Golden Ball, Necromancer, and Phantom have been nerfed.
