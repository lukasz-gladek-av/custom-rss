            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In my second hands-on opportunity with Pokémon Legends: Z-A on Nintendo Switch 2, I played for almost an hour, which still wasn’t nearly enough time to fully sink my teeth into this new, action-forward take on a mainline Pokémon game. However, it did ease some of my early concerns, pique up interest in mastering its battle mechanics, and reveal a few new details: like how you can power up moves with Mega Power, and Mega Evolve repeatedly in the same battle–at least with some caveats.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Wilds Zones - Where There’s Always a Catching Chance</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The modern setting of Legends: Z-A doesn’t exactly do it for me–even in real life I generally prefer exploring ancient forests and temples over cities when traveling–but I did get to explore a Wild Zone in Lumiose City myself during my hands-on this time around, and it was more interesting and fun than I expected. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokemon Legends: Z-A – September 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These Wild Zones are where wild Pokémon live within Lumiose City, and so it’s also where you can catch Pokémon. Like in Legends: Arceus, you can just toss a Poké Ball at a Pokémon to try and catch it, but you can make the task easier by damaging the wild Pokémon first. Legends: Z-A makes an interesting change to the already modified catch mechanic: you don’t have to worry about accidentally knocking a Pokemon out–they’ll “faint” for a while, indicated by stars circling their heads as they wobble in place, giving you a free chance to capture them, instead of “disappearing”--but keep in mind they <em>will</em> disappear if you wait too long after knocking them out.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Legends: Z-A makes an interesting change to the already modified catch mechanic: you don’t have to worry about accidentally knocking a Pokemon out–they’ll “faint” for a while, indicated by stars circling their heads as they wobble in place, giving you a free chance to capture them, instead of “disappearing.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m curious about how this affects capture rate, like how status effects and less HP increase your chances of catching a Pokémon. I actually hope that knocking a Pokémon out resets its catch rate, so there’s still some benefit to formulating a Pokémon-catching strategy with the right moves. Removing tediousness is usually a good thing, but removing tension to streamline things isn’t the change I'm looking for. Doing so completely undermines the satisfaction succeeding would have granted. I understand it’s much more difficult to methodically choose your next move to avoid knocking out a wild Pokémon in a real-time battle, but there needs to be some consequence for doing it. If there is no consequence, well, RIP False Swipe. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Verticality and Challenges </h3><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wild Zones in Legends: Z-A use the verticality of a city very well, allowing for exploration in the waterways below and the skyscraper rooftops above, creating micro-habitats for different collections of Pokémon. At one point, I climbed up a building to escape a very angry alpha Houndoom with glowing red eyes, and found a flock of happy-go-lucky Swablu at the top. Apparently, some other trainers at the event went up to a different roof and encountered an alpha Pikachu–who then chased them back down to Houndoom’s domain, making for an even scarier encounter. And I say scarier because the Houndoom was kind of frightening–at about five levels above my own Pokémon, it knocked out my poor Gyarados despite my type advantage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This encounter made me want to experiment with my movements and strategy, where I discovered Gyarados’ Whirlpool remained on the field when I switched it out. I tried to dish out a well-timed Sleep Powder to Whirlpool combo with two different Pokémon, and though I couldn’t quite pull it off well, it had me thinking of what possible combos could exist. The issue with having the moves on different Pokémon is that once you switch out, the new Pokémon’s moves start on a cooldown, essentially replicating the core game’s mechanic of allowing your opponent a free attack if you switch out in the middle of battle. The difference here is that, with quick thinking and positioning, there’s a higher chance of avoiding said free attack. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Legends: Z-A requires quick thinking, too. With it being real-time, there’s not a second to waste ruminating over which move would be the most ideal or efficient, and it doesn’t allow for forgetfulness. You’ll need to know your team like the back of your hand to be able to make appropriate switches at the drop of a hat, unless you want to pause all the time. It can get a bit hectic, actually, especially when I didn’t know the demo team! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, the Wild Zone had more crammed in it than what was suggested by looking at it on the map, made possible by the aforementioned verticality. There are plenty of Wild Zones, but I can’t help but worry how same-y they’ll feel considering they’re all contained within a city.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Trainer Battle Zones and Extra Goals</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">During this demo, I once again got to experience a Z-A Royale battle zone, too, but this time, at the higher W rank. I found some slime blocking my path, which a Water-type attack washed away, suggesting you’ll need a variety of Pokémon on your team in order to adequately explore everywhere there is. You’ll also want a mix of Pokémon and moves on your team to take advantage of extra missions. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As I wandered the battle zone, I picked up glowing bonus cards on the ground, which then provided missions that popped up on the right side of the screen. We could see these in a previous trailer, but I didn’t expect how much more interesting they’d make the battle zones. Instead of just taking out trainers one by one, which I could see becoming a bit monotonous, I kept these special conditions in mind. For example, one instructed me to start a battle with a Flying-type sneak attack, and another to land a super-effective Water-type attack. Successfully fulfilling these conditions gave me more Ticket Points at the end of the battle, getting me closer to a Challenger’s Ticket faster, which would then qualify me for a promotion match. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The promotion match I battled against Rintaro reminded me a bit of a Gym Leader battle, except instead of the trainer having a monotype Pokémon team, he had a “themed” team.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The promotion match I battled against Rintaro reminded me a bit of a Gym Leader battle, except instead of the trainer having a monotype Pokémon team, he had a “themed” team. He works at a restaurant and had a Simisage, Simipour, and Simisear–seemingly a callback to Pokémon Black and White’s restaurant-themed Striaton City Gym, run by Cilan, Chili, and Cress, whose partner Pokémon were the pre-evolutions of this trainer’s lineup. It was a cool battle, and I look forward to seeing other trainers’ teams as I crush their dreams to climb the ranks. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Battling Mega Victreebel and Repeat Mega Evolutions</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, in the fourth part of the demo, I fought a rogue Mega Evolved Pokémon. In the first demo I played at the Pokemon World Championships, I faced a Mega Absol, but this time, it was the larger-than-life, recently revealed Mega Victreebel. I also had three Pokémon capable of Mega Evolution at my disposal–a Houndoom, Absol, and Gardevoir. The battle against Mega Victreebel was more ferocious than the tutorial fight against Mega Absol despite Naveen fighting by my side, but I welcomed the challenge. Its attacks left poison on the ground, making it more difficult to avoid while I simultaneously dished out commands and picked up Mega Power orbs to Mega Evolve my Pokémon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When my first Mega Evolution Pokémon fainted, I thought I was screwed. In the core Pokémon games, you can only Mega Evolve one Pokémon per battle, and can’t Mega Evolve again, even if your first Mega Evolution Pokémon faints. Unexpectedly, that wasn’t the case during this battle in Legends: Z-A–I was able to Mega Evolve all three of my Pokémon, as long as I gathered the required Mega Power. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I didn’t get to test if this works in trainer battles, so I asked–and I was essentially told you’re not limited to single Mega Evolutions per battle–as long as you have the Mega Stone and Mega Power to support it. This is evidently possible when up against Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokemon, and likely possible in Wild Zones since the Mega Ring fills up with each attack and by collecting energy from breakable crystals. I’m curious how exactly this would work in trainer battles. In our demo, we weren’t high enough rank to access mega power in the trainer battle portions–so we’ll just have to test that later. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Plus Moves - The Solution to the (Possible) Repeat Mega Evolution Problem</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Mega Power, this resource does more than just allow your Pokémon to Mega Evolve. See, you can also use Mega Power to power up a Pokémon’s move into a “Plus Move” which packs more of a punch than usual. This power-up can be activated by pressing the plus button on the controller.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I can’t really see a reason to do this instead of saving up Mega Power to Mega Evolve–since Mega Evolved Pokémon’s moves are automatically Plus Moves. However, it could be a great mechanic to help Pokémon unable to Mega Evolve from becoming entirely obsolete. This would be especially important if you actually can Mega Evolve as many times as you want in trainer battles, solving the potential problem this freedom would cause.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Closing Thoughts </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the thing: it’s so difficult not to compare Legends: Z-A to Legends: Arceus, as the predecessor set expectations I feel like weren’t met. I liked Pokémon Legends: Arceus’ slightly modified battle system–the turn-based battles were just different enough with the introduction of Speed and Strong styles to mix things up. I also loved Arceus’ blast-from-the-past feudal setting, which allowed for some really cool and unprecedented Pokémon lore exploration. It triumphantly set itself apart from the rest of the mainline games’ very modern settings, and this was my highest expectation for the Legends series. It honestly makes me wonder if there will be time-travel stuff in Legends: Z-A to bridge this gap. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also definitely  a fantasy girly in general–I prefer archaic dungeons and dragons over high-tech spaceships, aliens, or even just modern-day shops and domestic animals. With all of this in mind, I’ve been skeptical from the start whether I’d like Legends: Z-A’s battle system or setting and story nearly as much as Legends: Arceus’, despite any potentially implemented learned lessons or improved systems. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After watching its intro cutscene and playing, overall, more than an hour of Legends: Z-A, I have to say I’m still skeptical if I’ll appreciate this experience more than I did Legends: Arceus. But I didn’t dislike anything I’ve played or seen, and absolutely had fun with it. Legends: Z-A’s gameplay loop is unique, and I’m looking forward to experimenting with and mastering the new, real-time battle system. I appreciate the risks Pokémon is taking here -  I just hope they fully pay off. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-a-the-final-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review.1306833/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">On my first day of work at IGN in 2018, I was asked, “What’s your favorite video game of all time?” My answer then was the same as my answer today: Final Fantasy Tactics. When I first played it on the original PlayStation back in the ‘90s, I was enraptured by the job system, the memorable cast of characters, and a story that offered little in the way of easy answers. Between the PSP re-release (The War of the Lions) with extra content but major performance issues, and mobile versions featuring only touch controls, the landscape of 2025 has long been primed for an updated version of this RPG classic that’s worthy of the original. Did Square Enix deliver with The Ivalice Chronicles? With only a few caveats, it absolutely did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite all the improvements in the turn-based tactical RPG genre over the last two-and-a-half decades, the original Tactics is one of those classics that still holds up today. The story, told to you by a historian many years in the future, has a powerful beginning in which we learn your character, Ramza, will go down in history as a hated criminal while his brother in arms becomes a legend despite not being all that he seems. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles Review Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What starts as a fairly focused tale spirals into conspiracies, backstabbing, the evils of a caste society, supernatural threats, and all the other staples you’d expect from a fantasy political drama. Throughout all of that it keeps Ramza at the center, with a foot in both worlds for perspective. It doesn’t give you tidy endings, and doesn’t shy away from the atrocities that the common people must face when powerful men with armies refuse to set aside their quest for power, and Ramza must continually come to terms with why he’s fighting in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully for our sake, all that awful fighting is still really fun to play through. Final Fantasy Tactics focuses much of the power in individual units rather than their synergy with each other, but the flexibility you have with how you want to use those units is immense. Each of the 20 jobs comes with its own set of action, reaction, support, and movement skills, and once learned they can all be mixed and matched with other classes. Want a Monk that can dual wield both fists (after leveling the Ninja class) while ignoring the elevation of the terrain (after leveling the Dragoon class) so he can jump 30 feet in the air to instantly punch a far-away enemy unit to death? Have at it. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What starts as a fairly focused tale spirals into conspiracies and backstabbing.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you put in the work, you can create some truly busted characters. The act of simply leveling a unit is a joy because you get instant progression feedback from every action you perform, and can easily assess your progress through the new UI. Since progression occurs with each individual action and not by finishing battles, you can either run through a bunch of different maps, leveling as you go, or spend a long time in one map, buffing, attacking, and healing friends and foes alike until you gain just enough experience for the next skill or job. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That old-school grind may not sound fun at first, but having the option to master entire jobs in a single battle or just earn the requisite experience that you need rather than being stuck with one you don’t want long-term gives you constant, concrete goals to achieve as you continue to build your party. And that carrot-on-a-stick feeling of the next job or next spell being within your reach if you do just a little more is essential to enjoying a job system such as this one. Other than Xenoblade Chronicles 3, I honestly can’t think of another RPG job system with such satisfying progression pacing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And you <em>will</em> need to progress, as the balance of the back half of the story is truly nutty. As sword-and-sandals warfare gives way to instant-kill techniques and screen-clearing summons from your enemies, you’re given some fantastically broken options in both late-game characters and classes. And because many of these late battles only require you to defeat one specific character rather than an entire team in order to win, it further emphasizes the outsized importance a single unit can have towards the end of the story, since you can plan around diving through the enemy team to take out its leader. One character you recruit in the very last stretch of story missions is a one-man wrecking crew, as is fitting with his reputation, but his inclusion is indicative of the wild swings Tactics leans into. You’re not forced to use him, but the difficulty is much higher if you don’t.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of classes, you have the standard fare options such as Squire, Knight, Archer, and Black Mage, which can all be powerful on their own – but each character also chooses from jobs that include Geomancer, which use whatever terrain they’re standing on as the basis for their long-range attacks, and Arithmetician, which casts any black magic, white magic, time magic, or mystic arts you’ve learned with that character instantly and without using MP based on the multiples of stats like EXP or current elevation (without distinguishing between foe and friend). It’s crazy stuff that gets pretty broken by the end, but a wrong button press can still wipe out your entire party. It’s a small picture of just how volatile these late fights can be, but you really have to earn your way there as the prerequisites for the class are intense.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That carrot-on-a-stick feeling is essential to enjoying a job system such as this one.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All this busted stuff is also completely optional depending on how you build your team, as you could choose to fight your way through most of Final Fantasy Tactics using Ramza and a few chocobos if you really wanted to test yourself. That’s especially true for The Ivalice Chronicles since there are now three difficulty options. I played through on the middle difficulty, and it seemed much the same as I remember aside from some tweaks to stats, requirements for learning skills, and even some enemy placements. Having finished that, I’m now more than halfway through a new playthrough on the highest difficulty, and I am enjoying the extra challenge. Hopefully it maintains this pace through the final chapter, as that’s where many of the balance issues lie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also still working through Midlight’s Deep (known as Deep Dungeon in the original Tactics), an optional endgame multi-level dungeon set completely in the dark, with exits hidden on particular squares, that is filled with stronger enemies than you’ll find throughout the story. The harder encounters are fun, but finding the exits without a guide is honestly kind of a chore as you can’t defeat all the enemies until you’ve found the staircase to the next level. It’s truly for the sickos who want to push their parties to the limit, but I can’t see casual fans having much fun with it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Tactics did have problems other than the balance issues that have thankfully been alleviated here. It was very poorly localized, with stilted dialogue that rendered the complex political landscape unintelligible at times, and had weird anachronisms like Ramza – a character from a supposedly medieval period – yelling out “Geronimo!” (a reference to an early 20th-century Apache military leader) as a war cry. Much of the depth of its characters was also hidden away in either hard-to-read menus or community guides, and the UI was needlessly clunky and complicated (as was the style at the time), making a lot of vital info a chore to understand. I’m happy to say that nearly every one of these issues, other than some of the endgame balance swings on the standard difficulty, has been addressed in The Ivalice Chronicles.</p><h2 data-cy="title1">A New War</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">None of the extra content found in The War of the Lions version on PSP, including the new playable characters, new jobs, or multiplayer mode are present in The Ivalice Chronicles. I did like Final Fantasy XII’s Balthier as a party member since it’s a cool connection across the Ivalice setting, but I don’t particularly miss anything else from that version, and the original Tactics’ cameos from another Final Fantasy I won’t spoil are still included – now with voice acting, which is really cool to hear. The one holdover they’ve kept from The War of the Lions is the vastly improved translation, which is great to see. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another immediately noticeable improvement is the updated graphical style, which is obviously much higher resolution while preserving the original’s retro isometric look. While I still yearn for a true HD-2D graphical remake with the look of Octopath Traveler or Dragon Quest III, this direction really grew on me after some initial resistance. At first glance, especially through YouTube compression, it looked almost like a smoothing filter over an emulated retro game, but I found that there’s almost a canvas-like quality to the texture of the screen as your toy soldiers march across the battlefield when I played it for myself. At its very worst, it didn’t bother me after a few hours; at its best, especially in scenes with warm lighting around the edges or the added tilt-shift focus, it can look really nice and enhance the illusion that you’re playing with miniatures.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Game Menu Noises</h3><p>The games with the best menu sounds, whether they be clicks, beeps, or bodily functions. 

Not the music! Just the UI sounds.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If the new look is too heretical for purists, the original version of Final Fantasy Tactics is also included with The Ivalice Chronicles, but you have to load into a different game completely (as opposed to something like Monkey Island or Halo: The Master Chief Collection, where you can swap back and forth at will) and you can’t even transfer save files between the two versions. I can respect the choice to stick with the classics, but know that doing so means you’ll also miss out on the best parts of this updated version: the new features and voice acting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I know “quality-of-life improvements” aren’t usually the sexy part of a review, but the myriad changes in The Ivalice Chronicles add up to much, much more than the sum of their parts. Dozens of changes, big and small, have sanded down many rough edges and made this feel like a comparatively modern game. A completely re-tooled interface fits modern TVs and places vital information up front, such as a dynamic turn order list on the left side of the screen, the current Job Points (a vital progression stat) of your character’s class, and optional life bars and names you can toggle on and off with the press of a button. There are quick options to retry a battle instantly or to retool your party before jumping back in, or to load a save straight from the pause menu. You can hold the left trigger and scroll through each character in the order of their actions to see exactly what spell that wizard is casting and where so that you can make sure you don’t walk right into it. You can reset your movement if you haven’t picked anything up in that space or committed to an action afterward. And when deploying your soldiers for battle, you do so on the actual map, not just a floating liminal space that may or may not work out how you planned once you commence the actual fight. You can even fast-forward, an almost necessary feature when revisiting retro RPGs through a modern lens – our tolerance for games wasting our time has shrunk to almost nothing these days, and it’s hard to argue that’s not a good thing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A completely re-tooled interface fits modern TVs and places vital information up front.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly all of these features and pieces of information were available in the original version, but only if you knew where they were hidden in the archaic menus and behind odd button presses, or by quitting and reloading. When you add up the time and headaches saved over a campaign that lasts for dozens of hours, these changes make a huge difference. All of these battle alterations feel methodical and deliberate, as if the developers cleaned the cobwebs out of a dusty old garage so you can appreciate the gorgeous, shiny car sitting inside of it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Equal care has been given outside of battles. Quick guides for jobs that tell you what attribute damage scales off of and recommended skills to learn, a quick one-sheet of abilities at a glance, a job tree that shows you the requirements of your next unlock, pop-up tooltips that give you the important aspects of skills and equipment, combat sets that allow you to change your roster setup on the fly, the list goes on. You can even avoid random encounters on the newly redrawn map, and trigger previously random encounters at will. They’ve really done a great job with smoothing out the wrinkles without changing what made the original special. </p><h2 data-cy="title1">New Voices</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Another new addition that would be hard to imagine going without is full voice acting, and not just for cutscenes. Battle cries, small remarks during actions, and even pleas to your humanity as you dismiss a unit are expressed with almost universally excellent acting. Common robbers and peasants will speak in a working-class cockney accent, the nobles with florid flair, and mid-battle anger and anguish comes across much more clearly than before when it was just text. Some of the death wails, which used to be kind of a goofy and ethereal sound effects, now really drive home the point that you are killing these people on a battlefield. I was a little shocked by that at first, but it does make more sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One example of voicework elevating a party member is Rapha, a character I’d never really cared much for previously. Despite her story always being a tragic one, hearing the pain and anger in her voice, as well as her accent being so different from everyone else’s, rounded out her character much more this time around. Also, there are just some world-class insults in here, and it’s fun to finally hear them out loud.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing of note is that often the tone in the Japanese language track is very different than the English one. What can seem like intense anger in the former can be an appeal to reason in the latter. They both work, but if you want emotions constantly ratcheted up a notch, Japanese is the way to go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With these new voices also come new conversations that you’ll only hear if you bring the right combination of characters into particular story battles. A lot of these are not very interesting, unfortunately – many just see them espouse platitudes about the nature of power and don’t reveal much new information about the characters themselves, and they tend to make battles a bit too chatty. But there are a few that offer genuine insight into relationships between people that were never explored in the original, which I really enjoyed. </p><h2 data-cy="title1">Final Fantasy Chronicles</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That doesn’t mean all these relationships are easy to keep track of, however, as the story involves several complicated power structures during a civil war, and so many people are double-crossing each other. Fortunately, much like the Active Time Lore feature of Final Fantasy XVI, The Ivalice Chronicles includes a fully interactive timeline called State of the Realm that shows you all the big movers and shakers as you continue through the story. Combined with a full encyclopedia, a list of all the cutscenes and the option to rewatch them, and a bunch of other tabs to keep terms, collectibles, and game tips straight, it helps a lot. While some of these overviews and biographies existed in the original’s Chronicle menu, their ease of access and updated layout here make them much less of a chore to peruse when looking for details I missed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tutorials have received an overhaul as well, with the layout becoming much more reader-friendly. As an example, the zodiac compatibility chart, a system you could complete the story several times over without knowing anything about, used to be presented in a screen that looked like an ASCII FAQ from the early 2000s; it’s now just written out in plain language and separated by tabs.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The tutorials' ease of access and updated layout make them much less of a chore.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also various criss-crossing side quests in the final chapter that are notoriously hard to follow, but their reputation will have to change now that they all have quest markers pointing you to new and important destinations. This doesn’t make these quests any easier to overcome, as you still have to fight the same tough battles to complete them, but it makes them a lot less frustrating because it saves you from having to look up where to go at every step. It’s just another example of getting you to the fun that was already there.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review]]></content:encoded>
