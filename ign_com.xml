            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Victory Royale. </h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">We all know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-festival-season-10-will-feature-gorillaz-starting-tomorrow">Fortnite is the king of crossovers</a>, but the tables have turned in recent years, with Fortnite crossing over into LEGO territory. We've had a handful of sets come out that represent the weird and whacky world of one of the most popular battle royale games, like the Durrr Burger and iconic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-the-lego-fortnite-battle-bus-a-digital-to-physical-triumph">Battle Bus</a>. The most recent set, which dropped earlier this month, is the gigantic Mecha Team Leader. I'm not the biggest Fortnite player, but even I can't deny how much fun this build was. </p><div catalogid="b1c6547c-25f1-4150-8779-f8bb2aa193e5" id="227362"><div id="227362" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Fortnite Mecha Team Leader</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The LEGO Fortnite Mecha Team Leader is easily the biggest build <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-batman-forever-batmobile-set-76304">I've done here on IGN</a>. When the box arrived in the mail I was genuinely surprised at its size. Coming in at just under two feet, the box is absolutely massive. The set itself is comprised of 2,503 pieces and is spread out among 19 bags. The instruction booklet is just as heavy-duty, feeling like a graphic novel at 317 pages. The instructions and sticker sets even came in a premium-feeling envelope to protect it, which I appreciated. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I didn't quite know what I was getting myself into when I started this build. I've built countless LEGO sets in my day, but truly nothing quite at this scale. I built this in one day because I don't know how to relax, with a couple breaks in between because my kitchen table chairs aren't comfy whatsoever. Overall, I think it took me around five or six hours. Every aspect of the mech's body is exquisitely detailed, each with their own extremely technical and unique attachment techniques. I timed it, and just one leg took me almost an hour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm not educated on the lore behind the Mecha Team Leader's design, but I think I can speak for everyone when I comment on how ridiculous (and ridiculously awesome) this set is. One leg is made up of what looks like ice cream, with an apple foot, while the other foot is a literal cheeseburger. I don't get it, and I don't care; this thing rules. Building the each body part was extremely satisfying, getting to see how in-depth the attachment techniques are. Every limb is movable and posable except for the knees, which unfortunately don't bend. But you can still articulate the mech's arms, hands, and fingers to put it up on your shelf however you want. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my favorite aspects of this build is the huge sword. It cleverly uses a grey LEGO minifigure blank head and ponytail hairstyle to simulate what I'm pretty sure is a fabric tassel on the end of the sword's grip. You can slot the sword into either of the mech's hands, so feel free to pose it however you want, the sword won't fall off. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mech's chest cavity opens up to allow a minifigure version of it to enter, and this is also one of the first parts of the build. You build out the pilot cockpit, complete with a detailed chair and screens to survey the battlefield, which are where most of the sticker elements come into play. The mech's armor breastplate itself was fun to build, but I'm questioning some of the sequencing in the steps here; it was difficult to attach the upper breastplate once it was fully assembled to the rest of the body without breaking off other pieces in the process. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The teddy bear head really ties the whole set together. It's the last bit of the build, and it also one of my favorite parts. I always appreciate how LEGO designers can take ordinary brick shapes and mold into an extremely detailed, uncanny recreation of what we all know to be a head, and the Mecha Team Leader's head is no different. Its eyes, ears, and little tufts of hair sticking out are awesome little details. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though I don't play Fortnite, the LEGO Mecha Team Leader is one of my favorite builds I've ever done, whether for IGN or on my own. Once it's all said and done, it stands at almost 18 inches tall. It's an impressively designed and time-consuming build that I highly recommend spacing out over multiple sessions. The minifigure version of the mech, the buildable sword, and "Fortnite" printed LEGO plaque are all great additions to an already great set. I love LEGO and I'm a huge nerd when it comes to appreciating the design of massive, technical sets like this, and I can't wait to see more of what they can cook up.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The latest Silent Hill movie is blazing its own trail.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Christophe Gans’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/return-to-silent-hill"><u>Return to Silent Hill</u></a> is hitting theaters in January 2026, just in time for the 20th anniversary of the original Silent Hill movie. This is good news, given that Silent Hill still ranks as one of the better video game movie adaptations to date. 2012’s Silent Hill: Revelation? Not so much. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cineverse just released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-teaser-trailer-revealed-for-third-movie-based-on-konami-game-franchise"><u>a short first teaser for Return to Silent Hill</u></a>, offering a glimpse of the many horrors Jeremy Irvine’s James Sunderland will face as he navigates the town in search of his missing wife.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that so much time has passed since Gans last set foot in the moody town of Silent Hill, you might be wondering how this sequel is connected to its predecessors. Is it a direct continuation of Silent Hill and Silent Hill: Revelations? Which game is it adapting? Here’s everything you need to know before Return to Silent Hill hits theaters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">How Return to Silent Hill Connects to the Other Movies</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">2006’s Silent Hill stars Radha Mitchell as Rose Da Silva, a woman who brings her adopted daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) to the remote, abandoned town of Silent Hill in order to get to the bottom of Sharon’s recurring nightmares. Sean Bean also stars as Rose’s husband Christopher, who attempts to rescue his family even as they become trapped in a hellish other dimension. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite featuring a different director and writer in M.J. Bassett, 2012’s Silent Hill: Revelation serves as a direct sequel to the first movie. Adelaide Clemens stars as the adult Sharon, now assuming the identity of Heather Mason. When her father disappears in Silent Hill, Heather and her classmate Vincent (Kit Harington) return to the town to find him. Revelation also deals heavily with the religious cult known as the Order of Valtiel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Return to Silent Hill is not a direct follow-up to either of those films. Instead, this film is telling a standalone story with a different set of characters. Return to Silent Hill stars Jeremy Irvine as James Sunderland, a widower who is stunned to receive a letter from his dead wife Mary (Hannah Emily Anderson), urging him to meet her in Silent Hill. James will descend deeper and deeper into the otherworldly dimensions of the town in order to find her. Silent Hill 2 Remake’s Evie Templeton will reprise her role as Laura, a young girl also caught in the web that is Silent Hill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, it seems you don’t necessarily need to have seen the other Silent Hill movies in order to enjoy Return to Silent Hill. This sequel follows the approach of the games in that the spooky town itself, not the characters, provides most of the connective tissue. Most of the games aren’t directly intertwined by plot, but instead focus on different characters being drawn into the town and finding their personal demons manifesting into literal monsters. The series is not unlike Hellraiser in that regard, as the Hellraiser movies are mostly standalone horror stories linked together by the overarching mythology of Pinhead and the Cenobites. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The script for a new Silent Hill movie that is totally independent from the two previous movies made and respects the way Silent Hill has evolved,” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-new-movie-2023"><u>Gans said in 2022</u></a>. “Silent Hill is a bit like Twilight Zone, the Fourth Dimension, a place where anything and everything can happen.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Silent Hill 2 (2024) Review Screens</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Which Games Does Return to Silent Hill Adapt?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If the description of Return to Silent Hill’s plot sounds familiar, it should. This film happens to be a direct adaptation of the Silent Hill 2 game, which was originally released in 2001 and remade in 2024. Just like this film, Silent Hill 2 follows James Sunderland as he navigates the various dimensions of the town in search of his late wife. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Return to Silent Hill looks to be the most faithful adaptation of the game out of the three films to date, to the point that Gans went to the trouble of casting Templeton as Laura again. We assume the film will follow the core beats of the game, pitting James against terrifying monsters like Pyramid Head and culminating in a similarly tragic twist ending. Pyramid Head himself can be seen in the teaser, making him the one character confirmed to appear in all three films.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither of the previous Silent Hill movies could be considered more than loose adaptations of the source material. The first Silent Hill film may borrow liberally from the imagery and music of the series, along with a few basic plot points from 1999’s Silent Hill, but its plot and cast of characters are largely unique. Silent Hill: Revelation is sort of an adaptation of the Silent Hill 3 game, transforming Rose and Christopher Da Silva into Heather and Harry Mason. But, again, the less said about Revelation, the better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Direct adaptation or not, it doesn’t appear that Return to Silent Hill will be a 1:1 copy of Silent Hill 2. Gans has hinted the film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240506195503/https://www.ecranlarge.com/films/dossier/1435959-le-pacte-des-loups-silent-hill-christophe-gans-pionnier-du-blockbuster-a-la-francaise" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>also draws inspiration from 2014’s P.T.</u></a>, the infamous demo that was meant to lead into Hideo Kojima’s canceled Silent Hills game. Does that mean the film will feature first-person sequences, a la 2005’s Doom? Or is the P.T. influence more in terms of the steadily mounting sense of dread and psychological horror? We’ll find out when Return to Silent Hill hits theaters in January 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Return to Silent Hill, find out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hills-first-cinematic-trailer-has-completely-divided-the-community"><u>why the teaser trailer has divided the Silent Hill fan community</u></a>.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

While you may be able to travel between planets within the same system, fans said it looked like you wouldn’t be able to fly <em>all the way</em> between systems. And it looks like you won’t be able to fly directly from a planet's surface into orbit, like No Man's Sky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">References to the new offering, referred to in the game's code as "Cruise Mode," were detected by players and shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1mii922/new_findings_in_the_last_2_update_suggest_dev/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reddit</u></a>, though Bethesda reportedly issued another small patch to scrub them from view.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in <a href="https://youtu.be/_zknfAghd-s?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new video discussing his career</a>, veteran Bethesda developer Tim Lamb confirmed that the studio has been working on Starfield’s space gameplay, and that a new DLC story is still coming at some point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think as it comes to Starfield, I'm really excited for players to see what the teams have been working on,” he said. “We have some cool stuff coming, including free updates and features the players have been asking for, as well as a new DLC story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I can't go into all the details just yet, but I will say part of the team has been focused on space gameplay to make the travels there more rewarding. We're also adding some new game systems, and a few other smaller delights. There's also some really interesting stuff coming down the pipe from our verified creators. There's some fun stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I just want to say thanks. We really appreciate the support and the enthusiasm. We can't wait to get it into the hands of our players.”</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-breaks-silence-on-starfield-future-promises-to-share-details-on-exciting-things-in-the-coming-months"><u>Bethesda said it had "exciting things" coming to Starfield soon</u></a> — presumably referring to this. However, Starfield was a no-show at gamescom 2025 last week, prompting further fan concern.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-reportedly-set-for-ps5-release-during-spring-2026-alongside-new-expansion"><u>Starfield's second expansion and much-anticipated PlayStation 5 port would now arrive in 2026</u></a>, following the poor reception to 2024 add-on Shattered Space. Bethesda boss Todd Howard had <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>previously talked of expansions arriving annually</u></a>, but perhaps Bethesda sees the addition of some form of spaceflight as something to keep players occupied until then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new IP in 25 years, but it was not as well received as the studio’s previous games in the Fallout and The Elder Scrolls franchises, and the Shattered Space expansion, released a year later in September 2024, has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield went on to reach 15 million players, but the question of whether Bethesda might walk away from the game to focus on its other franchises has been a running theme since release. In June 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2"><u>Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supporting Starfield</u></a>, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would come out following Shattered Space. And in an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking more generally about the development of Starfield, Lamb described it as “like making four games at once.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You have your, I'm running around shooting aliens and space guys,” he said. “You have your, I'm flying around in a spaceship, shooting other spaceships. You have the ship builder game. You have the outpost game. Starfield to me was like making four games at once.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
