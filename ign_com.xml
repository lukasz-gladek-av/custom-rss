That‚Äôs a question a lot of GTA Online players have been asking ever since GTA 6 was announced. And now, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">GTA 6‚Äôs fall 2025 release date</a> approaches, they‚Äôre no closer to an answer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online">GTA Online</a> is Rockstar‚Äôs hugely profitable live service that continues to pull in players even now, well over a decade since launch. Its enduring appeal and ability to print money is thought to have influenced Rockstar‚Äôs decision to prioritize the live service over story DLC for Grand Theft Auto 5, much to the annoyance of some fans. But there is a more pressing concern looming over the horizon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When GTA 6 eventually comes out, it is expected to bring with it a new and improved GTA Online. Perhaps this will be GTA Online 2. Perhaps it will be called GTA Online, as before. Either way, players of the existing GTA Online have expressed concern that all their time, effort, and money spent in the current GTA Online will be left behind for a potential clean break later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why invest time and money into GTA Online now, in early 2025, when the new GTA Online is potentially due out in perhaps eight months or so? That‚Äôs a question IGN put to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick during a recent interview ahead of the company‚Äôs third-quarter financial report, and his answer makes for interesting reading.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Zenick wouldn‚Äôt be drawn specifically on any new GTA Online because it has yet to be announced, he did talk generally about Take-Two‚Äôs form when it came to NBA 2K Online, a free-to-play online-focused version of 2K Sports‚Äô hugely successful basketball franchise aimed at the Asian market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NBA 2K Online launched all the way back in 2012, and then 2K Sports released NBA 2K Online 2 in 2017. Both games were maintained simultaneously, so fans of the first version could continue to play and invest their time and money safe in the knowledge they wouldn‚Äôt be left behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúI'm going to speak theoretically only because I'm not going to talk about a particular project when an announcement hasn't been made,‚Äù Zelnick began. ‚ÄúBut generally speaking, we support our properties when the consumers are involved with those titles. As an example, we launched NBA 2K Online in China, I think originally in 2012 if I'm not mistaken. And then we launched NBA 2K Online 2 in China in 2017. If I'm not mistaken. We did not sunset Online 1. They both are still in the market and they serve consumers and they're alive and we have this massive audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúSo we've shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last line is of particular importance. It suggests ‚Äî but doesn‚Äôt confirm at this stage ‚Äî that if there is a GTA Online 2, it won‚Äôt come at the cost of GTA Online falling by the wayside. If people keep playing GTA Online, Zelnick is suggesting here, then Rockstar will continue to support it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs worth noting that there‚Äôs still a huge amount we do now know about GTA 6, given all we‚Äôve had so far is Trailer 1 and a release window. But if GTA 6 is definitely due out fall 2025, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/boss-of-gta-6-and-borderlands-4-owner-take-two-says-it-will-time-its-releases-to-respect-the-consumers-need-to-spend-a-lot-of-time-playing-these-hit-games-before-they-go-on-to-the-next">potentially after Borderlands 4‚Äôs just-announced September release date</a>, Rockstar will have to reveal more sooner rather than later. In the meantime, check out Zelnick's comments on whether <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">skipping PC for GTA 6's launch is a mistake</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Highlights included Housemarque‚Äôs reveal of its Returnal successor, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saros-is-housemarques-successor-to-returnal-arriving-in-2026">Saros</a>, and the long-awaited release date for Konami‚Äôs Unreal Engine 5 remake, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-finally-confirmed-officially-this-time">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. But one notable video game was a total no-show: Bloodborne.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">the persistence continues üò≠ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bloodborne?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#bloodborne</a> <a href="https://t.co/GOcAO4Bi5g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/GOcAO4Bi5g</a></p>‚Äî Genki‚ú® (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1889812558040932572?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">As the 40-minute show wrapped up, most fans wiped off the clown makeup so they could inevitably rebuild expectations for some sort of comeback in the future. For others, the absence stung more than usual. March 24, 2025, marks the 10-year anniversary of Bloodborne‚Äôs launch on PS4, making this year feel like a now-or-never moment for PlayStation and developer FromSoftware to do... anything with the IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodborne remaster campaigners have slowly grown their numbers over the last five years, but hopes for an announcement took on a new form when Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-bloodborne-60fps-patch-says-sony-has-sent-him-a-dmca-takedown-but-why-now"><u>issued a DMCA takedown</u></a> to Lance McDonald, the creator of a popular Bloodborne 60fps mod for the action RPG, late last month. Sony was calling for links to the patch to be scrubbed from the internet, and only one week later, a PlayStation 1-style demake called Bloodborne PSX <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-the-bloodborne-psx-demake-becomes-the-latest-fan-project-to-suffer-a-copyright-claim-the-creator-of-bloodbornes-60fps-mod-has-offered-his-copium-official-remake-theory"><u>suffered the same fate</u></a>. It‚Äôs not exactly a surprise to see Sony taking action against community creations like this, but the timing had many, <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1886240572660457506" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>including McDonald</u></a>, raising their eyebrows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúMy copium theory is that Sony DMCAed the 60fps patch and the video about the Bloodborne demake so that when they announce a 60fps remake, Google searching for ‚ÄòBloodborne 60fps‚Äô and ‚ÄòBloodborne remake‚Äô won‚Äôt have collisions with our fan projects,‚Äù McDonald said. ‚ÄúLet me cope.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, just days after Sony moved to pull these fan-made projects down, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow-february-12th"><u>State of Play was announced</u></a>. After years of begging and nearly a decade since launch, this had to be it, right? Well, whether you were surprised or not, not one frame of Bloodborne found its way into the presentation, and fans haven‚Äôt been taking it well.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">another year no bloodborne <a href="https://t.co/XCB8LZ3Ds7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/XCB8LZ3Ds7</a> <a href="https://t.co/VVohE0C4gp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/VVohE0C4gp</a></p>‚Äî €ü (@scadutree) <a href="https://twitter.com/scadutree/status/1889809555003154451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">some of you clearly didn't watch amazon's secret level playstation episode when Sackboy turned to the camera and said, "We will NEVER remake or remaster bloodborne!" <a href="https://t.co/Y89LwShCVh" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Y89LwShCVh</a></p>‚Äî Gene Park (@GenePark) <a href="https://twitter.com/GenePark/status/1889814583868792917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/2BCcceRz2z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2BCcceRz2z</a></p>‚Äî Micky D (@DeMickyD) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeMickyD/status/1889902996856947048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Driving the cleaver deeper was Sony‚Äôs promise to bring <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/days-gone-remasered-revealed-with-april-2025-release-date">Days Gone Remastered</a> to PS5 owners in April. This re-release of Bend Studio‚Äôs post-apocalyptic narrative adventure arrives on the six-year anniversary of its original launch on PS4 and sees it joining a list of other first-party remasters that includes Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, The Last of Us Part I, and The Last of Us Part II Remastered. No-one outside Sony is sure on what qualifies a game to be deserving of a remaster. With so many players begging to return to Yharnam‚Äôs beastly streets and with FromSoftware titles more popular than ever, it‚Äôs hard not to walk out of a Bloodborne-less State of Play without a question mark above your head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, as quiet as Sony has been when it comes to Bloodborne content, fans haven‚Äôt been completely starved of an explanation from it or FromSoftware. Former Sony Interactive Entertainment executive Shuhei Yoshida, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-retiring-from-sony-in-january"><u>retired last month</u></a>, touched on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hasnt-sony-done-anything-more-with-bloodborne-playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-personal-theory"><u>his theory</u></a> as to why we‚Äôve not seen more Bloodborne during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a recent conversation with Kinda Funny Games</u></a>. He suspects that director Hidetaka Miyazaki is too busy and too attached to the IP to let anyone else get involved other than himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúI left first-party so I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on,‚Äù Yoshida said in January, ‚Äúbut my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So, I think he is interested, but he‚Äôs so successful and he‚Äôs so busy, so he doesn‚Äôt want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that‚Äôs my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that‚Äôs my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.‚Äù</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Everyone thought with Bloodborne's 10 year anniversary approaching and Sony DMCA taking down the 60FPS patch that something was coming but uhhh...</p><p>Nope.</p><p>We get Days Gone Remastered lmao <a href="https://t.co/Q8DzgbSJNi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Q8DzgbSJNi</a></p></div>‚Äî Michael (@LegacyKillaHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/LegacyKillaHD/status/1889816510497169759?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Miyazaki, meanwhile, has also addressed desires for a Bloodborne remaster and PC port. When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5"><u>speaking with IGN last year</u></a>, the Dark Souls mastermind clarified that he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúat liberty to speak to it‚Äù because FromSoftware doesn‚Äôt own the IP rights. It‚Äôs fair reason to dodge the conversation around Bloodborne, though Miyazaki also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>suggested to Eurogamer</u></a> that he believes a remake could benefit from modern hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúIt is a title we hold very dear and just as much as our fans,‚Äù the FromSoftware lead told Eurogamer early last year. ‚ÄúIt does make me very happy to see that there are still so many people passionate about it.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There has never been an official mention of a Bloodborne remaster, and 2025 is shaping up to be another year without some form of PS5 or PC port. As the PS5 barrels through its fifth full year on the market, one can only wonder when or if Sony will have anything to announce.

It‚Äôs a success for the Ukrainian studio, a miracle, really, considering the harrowing circumstances that followed Russian‚Äôs full-scale invasion of the country in 2022. But Stalker 2 suffers from well-documented bugs and issues; chief among them A-Life 2.0.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A-Life was a key feature of the first STALKER game that governed AI behavior across the game world. At a high level, it is a system for simulating life in the Zone that works its magic seemingly independently of the player‚Äôs actions or whereabouts. It helps to create convincing AI and the emergent gameplay STALKER is famous for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GSC had said A-Life 2.0 would make the Zone feel alive as never before, that it would fuel emergent gameplay on a scale previously thought impossible. Indeed for some fans, A-Life 2.0 was STALKER 2‚Äôs biggest selling point. But when STALKER 2 actually came out players discovered that A-Life 2.0 didn‚Äôt work properly, with some questioning whether it was even in the game at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam"><u>GSC explained what went wrong with STALKER 2‚Äôs A-Life 2.0</u></a>, and vowed to fix the system. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-patch-11-is-a-big-one-adds-first-iteration-of-a-life-fixes">Patch 1.1</a>, released in December, was the first step on that road.
