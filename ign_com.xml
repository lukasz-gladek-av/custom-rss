Most of the offerings are neatly wrapped up in a short event pass that asks competitors to complete challenges, such as playing matches and racking up assists, to earn XP, and, of course, some rewards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/18668065416/UPD-Blue-Lock-Rivals" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Blue Lock: Rivals Lunar New Year</u></a> event pass itself comes with a rideable dragon and Styles, with the real prize being a stylish Dragon Cape to wear into each match. Other limited rewards include the Lantern Goal Effect, a fire-breathing Roar emote, a Lanterns cosmetic, and the red-and-gold Lunar player card. It’s all available from today through January 31, so make sure to start scoring goals now if you want to nab everything before it’s gone.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/25/blue-lock-rivals-lunar-new-year-update-1737833022208.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Blue Lock: Rivals update brings Lunar New Year to Roblox soccer fans.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The team behind the update detailed a few other highlights in its patch notes. New maps have been introduced, with the developers teasing that this fresh selection is “way more optimized.” There are also new teams, a volley system, and Keybind options now available for players, too. Finally, the Lunar New Year update is said to include “lots” of bug fixes and quality-of-life changes, though what these specific changes are remains unclear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blue Lock: Rivals takes inspiration from the manga and anime series of the same name by pitting players against one another in high-octane, powered-up soccer matches. While other popular Roblox experiences prioritize action and tower-defense gameplay, the team behind this unofficial spinoff has carved out a place for itself as one of the biggest draws for sports and anime fans. The Lunar New Year event comes as the latest patch since launch arrived last July, with another recent update including the Yukimiya and Hiori Style and Flows as well as a rework for Bachira that came with three new abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Roblox sports experiences, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blade-ball-update-adds-santa-vs-elves-mode-ahead-of-upcoming-blade-league-launch"><u>a December Blade Ball update</u></a> that brought along Christmas present to open for dodgeball fans.
