            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-gaming-boss-phil-spencer-wont-rule-out-any-xbox-exclusive-making-the-jump-to-playstation-including-halo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With Microsoft’s multiplatform video game release strategy in full swing, some Xbox fans are wondering whether flagship exclusives such as Halo will ever make the jump to PlayStation. But according to Microsoft’s gaming chief Phil Spencer, there are no “red lines” in its first-party lineup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has so-far used older games released over a year ago for its multiplatform push as opposed to brand new games, but that will soon change with the release of Indiana Jones. Microsoft will launch MachineGames' hotly anticipated Xbox game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-finally-gets-a-release-date-for-xbox-and-playstation-gamescom-2024"><u>on PS5</u></a> just a few months after it launches on Xbox and PC this December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the latest first-party Xbox game to make the jump to a rival console, following the release of Obsidian’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pentiment"><u>Pentiment</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grounded"><u>Grounded</u></a>, Tango Gameworks’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hi-fi-rush"><u>Hi-Fi Rush</u></a>, and Rare’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sea-of-thieves"><u>Sea of Thieves</u></a> earlier in 2024. In June, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-confirmed-for-ps5-xbox-games-showcase-2024"><u>Microsoft announced Id Software's upcoming Doom: The Dark Ages will also launch on PS5</u></a> next year.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/13/gettyimages-2183768916-1731502030266.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer. Photo by Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer has said Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business — with the pressure now on to deliver following its eye-watering $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We run a business,” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5">Spencer said in August</a>. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s pretty clear at this point that Xbox console exclusives are no longer a priority for Microsoft’s gaming business, but are there some Xbox games that are considered so sacred that they will never launch on PlayStation?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer said every Xbox game is up for grabs when it comes to making the multiplatform jump. “I do not see sort of red lines in our portfolio that say ‘thou must not,’” he said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo on PlayStation would perhaps be the biggest Xbox game to go multiplatform so far, given its association with the console over the years. Last month, tech experts said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-halo-games-moving-to-unreal-engine-as-developer-343-industries-officially-changes-its-name"><u>Halo’s move to Unreal Engine 5</u></a> would make it easier for developer Halo Studios, née 343 Industries, to take Xbox’s flagship first-person shooter multi-platform, including a launch on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s too early to make any sort of decision on the next version of Halo, Bloomberg quoted Spencer as saying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As former Xbox boss Peter Moore recently told IGN, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore"><u>Microsoft will be debating whether to bring Halo to PlayStation as we speak</u></a>. Perhaps a multiplatform release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> or even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-infinite">Halo: Infinite</a> would be more likely in the short term, with Microsoft yet to indicate when the next Halo game will come out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Victor J.

If a player opens one containing a Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Charizard ex</a>, and Blane, for example, there's a chance a friend of that player, or even a complete random, will see this pack in their Wonder Pick section.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They can then choose to open this pack and be presented with the Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard, Charizard ex, and Blane, but each card is flipped around and players pick just one at random.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kOx_xHGujN4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PokéNinaa</a> shared a clip of her opening a pack while a friend checked their Wonder Pick from her. The moment PokéNinaa selected Open a Pack, and was presented with the carousel of boosters presenting a choice, her Wonder Pick appeared on her friend's account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wonder Pick contained a pack PokéNinaa hadn't open previously, and contained Pyukumuku, Blitzle, Slowpoke, Kabutops, and Melmetal. She then picked a booster pack from her myriad options and was presented with Pyukumuku, Blitzle, Slowpoke, Kabutops, and Melmetal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oher players have shared the same findings with Wonder Picks, leading to a general belief among the Pokémon TCG Pocket community that pack choices don't actually matter. It certainly appears to be the case, especially with The Pokémon Company refusing to say anything to the contrary, but there's a chance this could be an unintended bug or similarly unintended mechanic that will disappear once the game grows older than a couple of weeks.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Genetic Apex</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived in October on iOS and Android as a digital version of the beloved trading card game.

            <title><![CDATA[Lego Horizon Adventures Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-horizon-adventures-review.1034478/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It took me a while to figure Lego Horizon Adventures out. It’s the action game equivalent of watching the movie version of a book you like: It hits the major points, takes some liberties with characters and events, and then wraps everything up with a shiny bow in an abridged length. And like so many Hollywood adaptations, it handles the source material well without ever hitting the same heights. After spending 21 hours reaching 100% completion, I enjoyed nearly everything about its beautiful world and rich customization options, but predictable level design,  and a lack of things to do beyond the modest yet well-paced campaign made it feel like I was building a Lego set while missing a page or two from the instruction manual.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lego Horizon Adventures is a playful retelling of 2017’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> in the body of a typical Lego co-op action game. While it may not go into the depths of that story when it comes to the world or Aloy's origins, the broad strokes paint an entertainingly familiar picture for existing fans that’s still simple enough for newcomers to enjoy as well. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The 12-hour campaign took me across recognizable regions like the foliage-filled forest of the Sacred Lands, the frigid Snowchant Mountains, and the scorching hot Sunfall Desert. Each mission is filled with swaths of machines and cultists to overcome, chests filled with Studs (basically Lego money) to collect, objects to build or break, and plenty of charming character moments to keep the journey enjoyable. Those moments are often brief, but plenty of them had me chuckling from start to finish. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout Aloy's Journey, she's joined by an eclectic cast of playable allies: Rost, her mentor and father figure; Varl, a young Nora hunter looking to prove himself; Teersa, the village elder who's never short on quips; and Erend, a lovable brute with a big hammer. It’s great that original voice actors Ashly Burch, John Hopkins, John Macmillan, and nearly everyone else you encounter are back to reprise their roles, and the lighthearted tone of this outing gives them all room to experiment and have fun with characters I otherwise know well in some amusing ways.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The world of Horizon looks great in Lego form.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The one unfortunate exception to this is Sylens. He is back too, this time with a love of DJ'ing as he assists Aloy and friends from afar, but with a new voice actor after the tragic passing of Lance Reddick last year. Sylens has always been a reserved character, but I wish his sharp tongue had been showcased more in the many scenes with him in Lego Horizon Adventures, and the new performance from Tim Russ can often feel flat or clash with the energy and playfulness of the other characters. However, I will say that the decision to make him a DJ is inspired, and a fitting match for the zany quirks that everyone else has, like Varl's overprotective love of his comic books or Erend's obsession with Donuts.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Master Builder</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The world of Horizon looks great in Lego form. Each level is filled with charm, constructed out of smart recreations of familiar structures like dilapidated buildings to climb around or destroyed sections of road mixed with things like a traditional Lego police station. These additions can distract from the Horizon flavor a little, but aren't harmful in their own right as the environments still nail the look and feel overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s especially true of the soundtrack. The music is fantastic, pulling some great choices from Horizon Zero Dawn’s score and adding its own flair with some EDM and pop-inspired tracks. One standout was called Post-Apocalyptic Dance Party, which would feel right at home with songs like Everything is Awesome from The Lego Movie. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, the design of the levels themselves frequently boil down to just a few key components: linear exploration sections that often hide a few chests full of either Studs or the occasional limited-use rare weapon or gadget, arenas to fight numerous machines and cultists in, and then sometimes a platforming area with simple jumps and climbing paths as you chase a Tallneck to end of the stage. Special Cauldron levels can also have slightly trickier platforming sections that require you to use either some form of shock item or weapon to power movable objects or open doors. While each stage is different, it became clear after just a few hours that the formula is too predictable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was also a noticeable lack of things to do besides platform and fight – no puzzles to solve, and no sneakily hidden secrets to obtain things that many fans of Lego games have come to expect. For example, red bricks are relegated to just unlocking a few costumes and customization items instead of various cheats as usual, like the stud multiplier or 8-bit music modifier. It’s fine that they serve a different purpose here, but when I know they are usually used for so much more, the unavoidable comparisons come across as lacking.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Piece of Resistance</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Customization picks up some of the slack, and was one of my favorite elements of Lego Horizon Adventures. There are over 100 gold and red bricks to collect for unlockables like costumes and town alterations. You obtain a small portion of them by completing levels, but most are earned by completing tasks on a community board in the hub area, Mother's Heart. The community board encourages you to change your outfits regularly, asking you to do things like dress as various Ninjago characters before defeating enemies with specific elemental attacks, or build certain items in town that let you catch a fish or play fetch with a dog. You can even radically change how Mother’s Heart looks, whether that’s adding hot dog carts, dropping dragons onto rooftops, or dressing all the townsfolk up like ice cream cones. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to those cosmetic choices, you also have two simple but helpful skill tree options to take advantage of; one is a general skill tree that benefits your whole team, while the other is a set of character-specific trees. The general tree offers benefits like experience bonuses, extra healing, and extending the duration of enemies being frozen, shocked, or on fire. Meanwhile, the character-specific trees offer advantages that increase maximum health, weapon damage, or other unique bonuses. These are all unlocked simply by leveling up after earning experience from defeated enemies, with combat standing as a simple but satisfying exercise in picking off the specific body parts of your machine adversaries. By using Aloy’s Focus to target these body parts, you can change how fights play by doing things like removing the horns of a Broadhead so it hurts itself whenever it collides with objects in the environment. Skills can also come in handy when taking down bosses and stronger enemies, which provide more of a challenge than I was expecting from the Lego series. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Lego Horizon Adventures Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Typically, dying in Lego games costs you some Studs and then puts you right back into the battle – but in Lego Horizon Adventures, death instead sends you back to your previous checkpoint, which is usually the start of an area. I'm torn on whether or not this system is better than the original, as I liked that it left more money in my pocket for customization, but that comes at the cost of having to grab chests and build environmental objects again as I retrace my steps after a death. Either way, the good news is that experience earned and progress in various community board challenges is retained, so dying was still only ever a minor annoyance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if it’s more obnoxious to you, Lego Horizon Adventures has five difficulty options to choose from. The lowest setting has enemies only dealing one or fewer hearts worth of damage, and things scale up well to the highest option, where machines like Corruptors or Thunderjaws could deal five or more hearts per hit, taking me down in as little as one or two swings. I almost always prefer to play on the hardest difficulty setting available, but the tough part about doing so here is the lack of mechanics for dodging attacks. You’ll occasionally get access to the Rush Boots gadget, which allows you to zip around the environment in short bursts, but that brings me to another pain point I have mixed feelings about: the unpredictability of item drops. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Jada's Favorite Lego Games Unranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In Horizon Zero Dawn, equipping weapons with the correct elemental type can make a difficult fight much more manageable. While Lego Horizon Adventures adapts that same idea in the form of limited-use rare weapons and gadgets, which ones you get out of chests or from enemy drops is random for the most part. There are some great options like homing weapons or gravity bombs that pull enemies together before exploding. Weaker machines like broadheads and grazers still have tanks on their back that are vulnerable to one-hit kills with elemental attacks, too, but whether or not you're lucky enough to have it is another story. On the one hand, I like the chaotic nature of using whatever I can find mid-fight. On the other, it would have been nice to be able to select specific rare weapons to some degree, especially because certain challenges require certain weapon types to complete them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s cool that you can at least guarantee you get some item drops by breaking off the back of a Shell-Walker, but you also never know what’s inside or which battles they will appear in. Thankfully, there are a few surefire ways to get special items, like a merchant that typically shows up at the midpoint of each stage with a trio of chests containing three random items or by investing in weapon-based abilities in the skill tree. These can help by making specific items drop more often, as well as one skill that gives you a random rare weapon and gadget at the start of each level. These options help, but they still aren't a perfect solution. Granted, all of the rare weapons you <em>could</em> find are both powerful and fun to use, so there’s no going wrong in a general sense, but thinning out the herd with a precise element can go a long way when five or more enemies spawn into an ongoing battle.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-review">Stellar Blade review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Stellar Blade is great in all of the most important ways for an action game, but dull characters, a lackluster story, and several frustrating elements of its RPG mechanics prevent it from soaring along with the best of the genre.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Shift Up has continued to update the game and even added crossover DLC with other video game franchises, most recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nier-automata">Nier: Automata</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Stellar Blade November 20 Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In its financial report, Shift Up said that after Stellar Blade’s launch “sales continued at a stabilized level,” although it failed to provide an updated sales figure. It did, however, provide revenue directly attributed to the game: 25.8 billion won (approx $18.5 million) during the quarter Stellar Blade came out (April to June), and 22.5 billion won (approx $16.1 million) during the company’s third quarter (July to September). That’s a total of 48.4 billion won (approx $34.6 million) as of the end of September.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, Shift Up’s other game, mobile action RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/goddess-of-victory-nikke">Goddess of Victory: Nikke</a>, makes more money than Stellar Blade (approx $51.9 million during the same two quarters).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To enhance the IP value and maintain momentum, we have been consistently releasing content patches and updates, which has helped sustain the game’s popularity,” it said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shift Up plans to keep interest in Stellar Blade on PS5 going until the game launches on PC next year, what it calls the “platform expansion.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The release is being considered within 2025,” Shift Up confirmed. “Considering recent trends such as Steam's expanding market share in the AAA game sector and the global success of Black Myth: Wukong, we expect the performance on PC to exceed that on consoles.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, Shift Up raised 435 billion won ($320 million) in its first day of trade after an initial public offering. According to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/game-maker-shift-debuts-south-220000910.html?guccounter=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg</u></a>, that was the largest in the country for a gaming company since 2021, when PUBG maker Krafton Inc. raised $3.8 billion from its own IPO. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shift Up has an unannounced multiplatform RPF codenamed Project witches in the works. It said it plans to launch it at some point after 2027, with more information due in the first half of next year. Given the success of Stellar Blade, it seems likely Shift Up is also considering a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
