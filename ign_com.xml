But, we highly encourage you to slow down before making any big purchases at full price, as there's always an opportunity to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-deals-2024">save a Pokédollar or two</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of top Pokémon TCG discounts to consider today so take a gander at what we've picked out as the best of the best. TL;DR, the Amazon "Holiday Exclusive" <a href="https://zdcs.link/9g34rG?object_uuid=e13f64c2-62d2-44f3-877b-eeb86a7f26d4&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paradox Fury Premium Collection</a> has dropped to its lowest price ever and will arrive before Christmas.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Best Pokémon TCG Deals Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite in the sale is undoubtedly the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9g34rG?object_uuid=e13f64c2-62d2-44f3-877b-eeb86a7f26d4&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paradox Fury Premium Collection</a>, hitting an all-time low price at Amazon (according to <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0D6D6BJJ1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">camelcamelcamel</a>). It's exclusive to the retailer, and at a handy new price, $49.77, compared to its original listing for $67.99, it's the perfect gift to the Pokemon trainer in your life (or for yourself!).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, it's hard to not mention the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMvky4?object_uuid=e13f64c2-62d2-44f3-877b-eeb86a7f26d4&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grand Adventure Collection</a>, which hasn't been discounted but is now back in stock at Target for a limited time.

The <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5b4K5?object_uuid=5f83cdc0-10f0-40db-8529-9a7a7be972dc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anker Zolo 10,000mAh 30W USB Power Bank</a> is back down to only $15.59, a 40% discount from its original $26 price. This is an excellent deal for an Anker-branded 10,000mAh power bank that can fast charge a Nintendo Switch console at its maximum rate. The Zolo is compact, can completely recharge a Switch console more than once, and has a couple of unique nifty features, like a built-in USB cable and a discrete digital display. Plus, it's decked out in a rare pastel blue, pink, and white color schemes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Anker Zolo 10,000mAh USB Power Bank for $15.59</h2><div catalogid="8479891f-e34a-4cd8-951d-5230aeb5aeed" id="209566"><div id="209566" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker Zolo 10,000mAh 30W USB Power Bank</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two reasons why this power bank is a great battery backup for your Nintendo Switch console: capacity and charging rate. A 10,000mAh (37Whr) power bank can charge a Nintendo Switch OLED from completely empty to full about 1.9 times. Provided you fully charge your Switch from the get-go, that nearly triples your total playtime. At the same time, a 10,000mAh power bank still maintains a pretty small footprint; for example, this particular model is about the size of an iPhone and weighs under 8oz. The Anker Zolo power bank also boasts a 30W charging output over USB Type-C. The Nintendo Switch console accepts a maximum charging rate of 18W. That means this power bank will be able to charge your Switch at the same rate as the official Nintendo charger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Zolo has a built-in USB cable, however it's not retractable. Instead, you plug it into itself so that it forms a secure loop that's strong enough to be used like a lanyard. I have this power bank myself and I can tell you the loop is quite sturdy. There's also a separate USB Type-C port that be used for either input or output. Finally, there's a simple digital display that shows you the remaining battery charge as a percentage.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TSA-Approved</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Note that the TSA requires all power banks to be brought in carry-on bags; <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/power-banks" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">power banks are not allowed in check-in</a> regardless of capacity. The Anker power bank's 10,000mAh capacity is well below TSA's 27,000mAh carry-on limit, so it can be brought onto planes. It's also low-profile enough that no one will take notice in the first place. If a TSA official actually does take the initiative to test the wattage on your power bank, you're well in the clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more options, check out our picks for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-portable-charger">best power banks of 2024</a>.
