Others, however, believe the bottom left 'finger' is simply flesh falling off the little finger above it, although there are irregularities with the present boxes and ribbons in the bottom right, too. Generative AI often struggles with hands, adding extra fingers where they shouldn't be.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/09/share-20241206-1244480-1-1733745842140.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Black Ops 6's 'Necroclaus' loading screen. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another image of a gloved hand was used to show off a new Zombies community event. It contains what looks like six fingers with no thumb on-screen, suggesting up to seven digits on this hand.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/09/share-20241206-1244200-1-1733745876407.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The central image includes a gloved hand with some odd things going on. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Activision for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of the Zombie Santa image sparked a closer look at other images in Black Ops 6, which some in the Call of Duty community have now called into question. Redditor Shaun_LaDee highlighted three images included in paid bundles that have irregularities that could suggest the use of generative AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are now calling on Activision to disclose the use of generative AI for art that is included in bundles that are sold. And as others have pointed out, Steam operator Valve now has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI disclosure rules</a> that call on publishers and developers to describe how they use AI in the development and execution of their games. As part of this, Valve has told developers it will include their disclosures on the Steam store page of their game, “so customers can also understand how the game uses AI.” Currently, Call of Duty’s Steam page has no such disclosure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wired</a> reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-reportedly-sold-an-ai-generated-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-cosmetic">Activision sold an “AI-generated cosmetic” for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 last year</a>. The cosmetic in question was not named, but was linked to the Yokai’s Wrath bundle released in December 2023. The store did not disclose any use of generative AI for this bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle cost 1,500 COD Points, the premium virtual currency sold for real-world money that generates hundreds of millions of dollars for Activision each year. 1,500 COD Points is approximately valued at $15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wired pointed out that Microsoft, which owns Activision Blizzard after its $69 billion acquisition of the company last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce"><u>cut 1,900 staff from its gaming business</u></a> just months after Activision sold this skin. The report alleged that 2D artists’ jobs were being replaced by AI at the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of 2D artists were laid off,” one anonymous Activision artist told the site. “Remaining concept artists were then forced to use AI to aid in their work.” Activision employees were allegedly “made” to sign up for AI training, with its use promoted throughout the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. Generative AI thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Players will also compete for bragging rights, however, as a handful of new emblems are awarded to those able to win again and again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Versus Battle page once again includes an Event Match option that lets players compete for these emblems. Those able to win two matches in a row will earn the purple Participation Emblem, those who win three matches in a row will earn the Bronze Emblem, four matches nets the Silver Emblem, and five nets the Gold Emblem.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Genetic Apex</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Regular rewards don't require consecutive wins, as event missions have been added to award the aforementioned Pack Hourglasses and Shinedust.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-a-smash-hit-with-10-million-players-in-just-3-days<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> just hit an impressive milestone: 10 million players in three days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase’s free-to-play superhero team-based PvP shooter launched on December 6 across PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. While Sony and Microsoft do not make PlayStation or Xbox player numbers public, Steam makes Valve stats available, and it’s there that Marvel Rivals is enjoying a particularly massive launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals peaked over its launch weekend with 480,990 concurrent players, which was enough to put it in Steam’s top five most-played games. It’s the 20th highest concurrent player number ever seen on Steam, ahead of the likes of Helldivers 2, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Destiny 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, Marvel Rivals has a ‘mostly positive’ user review rating, with 76% of the 35,000 reviews tagged as positive. Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review"><u>Marvel Rivals Review in Progress</u></a> to find out what we think.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel Rivals - Character Skins Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For NetEase, it will be hoping not only to keep Marvel Rivals’ player count as high as possible for as long as possible (something that’s proved particularly tricky for live service games of late), but to make enough money from players to meet the company’s internal revenue projections. To that end, Marvel Rivals sells a battle pass and premium skins, but are they convincing players to open their wallets? Early signs suggest they are — Marvel Rivals is the second top-selling game on Steam by revenue, behind only Grinding Gear Games’ action RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals launched alongside Season 0, dubbed Dooms’ Rise. This month-long kick-off season starts with a total of 33 heroes, all available to play for free, eight maps for Quick Match and Competitive modes, a Conquest map, and a Practice Range. Dooms' Rise serves as the opening chapter “for the chaos caused by each of Doctor Dooms’ time experiments colliding and unleashing the Timestream Entanglement,” NetEase said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a Twitch Drops event for Season 0, as you’d expect from a live service game of this type, an 'Entangled Moments' seasonal event to unlock spray rewards, gallery card rewards, and stories for completing tasks, and a global launch gift: a special code for a free Iron Man costume.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
