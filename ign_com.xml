            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-coolest-figures-and-collectibles-revealed-for-star-wars-day-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">How much money would you pay for a Jar Jar Binks Hot Toy?</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A big part of the fun with Star Wars Day each year is seeing a new wave of toys and collectibles revealed by companies like Hasbro, Sideshow, and Hot Toys. This year's event certainly didn't disappoint, as we got glimpses of a wide range of upcoming products, ranging from less than $20 to over $1500. What can we say? Being a Star Wars collector is nothing if not an expensive hobby. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From Sideshow's epic Luke Skywalker Red 5 statue to Hasbro's nostalgia-heavy Episode III figures to Hot Toys' mind-bogglingly detailed Jar Jar Binks figure, these were the coolest figures and collectibles revealed during Star Wars Day 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hot Toys' Star Wars Figures</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hot Toys' Star Wars Day 2025 Figure Reveals - Image Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot Toys revealed quite the impressive lineup of 1:6 scale figures for Star Wars Day, including a couple of major characters who have surprisingly never gotten the Hot Toys treatment before now. The real surprise is definitely<a href="https://zdcs.link/av4eXq?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> the Jar Jar Binks figure</a>. Love him or hate him, there's no denying that this Jar Jar looks like he walked right off the screen. He's even got seamless arm joints and two swappable face sculpts for recreating all those wacky poses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot Toys is also filling a glaring hole in the Sequel Trilogy lineup by finally releasing <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXO73?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a Poe Dameron figure</a>. Fittingly, Poe is wearing his Resistance X-Wing jumpsuit. We're also getting another of the fan-favorite Republic Commandos in the form of Clone Commando Boss, and the company's new Star Wars Rebels-inspired line of animated figures is getting <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qqw2Xq?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a Darth Vader</a> to accompany the previously announced Stormtrooper figures.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hasbro's Star Wars Toys</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hasbro's Star Wars Day 2025 Figures - Image Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro revealed a number of new figures in both the 6-inch Black Series line and 3 3/4-inch Vintage Collection line. Hasbro continues to capitalize on the 20th anniversary of Revenge of the Sith by releasing new Black Series figures in packaging based on the classic RotS toy line. Next up are Aayla Secura and a Magnaguard droid. Black Series collectors can also augment their Imperial trooper collections with a Rogue One-themed 2-pack that includes both a Shoretrooper and a Death Trooper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the Vintage Collection front, Hasbro has a couple very interesting multi-pack releases in the works. The "Stormtroopers of the Empire 3-Pack" features a Snowtrooper, Scouttrooper and a Sandtrooper. The "Cantina Adventure 4-Pack" includes four aliens from the iconic Mos Eisley sequence, including Hammerhead, Walrus Man, Greedo, and Snaggletooth. It should go great with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hasbro-reveals-massive-mos-eisley-cantina-playset-for-hardcore-collectors">Hasbro's crowdfunded Mos Eisley Cantina playset</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Star Wars prop collectors will be happy to know that a new ForceFX Elite lightsaber based on the weapon used by Rebels' star Ezra Bridger is in the works. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Sideshow's Star Wars Figures and Posters</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sideshow Collectibles' Star Wars Day 2025 Reveals - Image Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not to be outdone,. Sideshow Collectibles had a wide lineup of figures, statues, and art prints to reveal. Undoubtedly the showpiece of their Star Wars Day lineup is <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbMOG?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Luke Skywalker: Red Five, Standing By Premium Format Figure</a>. This massive 1:4 scale, mixed media statue features Luke decked out in his X-Wing jumpsuit and climbing up the ladder to his trusty ship. What really makes this piece special (and especially expensive) is that Sideshow went to the trouble of actually sculpting a portion of the X-Wing so that it hangs in mid-air.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sideshow is also continuing to release 1:6 scale figures alongside distributing Hot Toys' releases. Sideshow is focusing on its "Scum and Villainy" line, which highlights the many aliens and creatures that don't necessarily receive attention from Hot Toys. The second wave of Scum and Villainy figures is focused on characters from Jabba's Palace in Return of the Jedi, like Bib Fortuna, Klaatu, and Vizam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Sideshow showed off the latest 1:10 statue from Iron Studios, which happens to be <a href="https://zdcs.link/akK2Rg?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a shrunken-down version of their 1:4 scale Darth Vader statue</a>. This Empire Strikes Back-inspired piece still looks mighty cool in the new, smaller scale. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let us know in the comments below what your favorite Star Wars Day 2025 reveal was, and why it's Hot Toys Jar Jar. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more Star Wars collecting fun, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-action-figure-buying-guide">our ultimate guide to Star Wars figures</a>, and check out <a href="https://store.ign.com/collections/star-wars-collection?srsltid=AfmBOoq2K47zHS8E-dixwmL2QU3V17lhK9-dv5HG8_tj5Haha876zuN-" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the many Star Wars Collectibles available on the IGN Store</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/devolver-digital-is-going-out-of-its-way-to-launch-a-new-game-the-same-day-as-gta-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar Games has revealed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>Grand Theft Auto 6's</u></a> release date is May 26, 2026, and indie game publisher Devolver Digital says it’s already making plans to be there with a new game of its own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company took a lighthearted shot at what is indisputably set up to be the biggest game launch of 2026 with a release date announcement of its own <a href="https://x.com/devolverdigital/status/1918277581167907305" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on X/Twitter</a>. Now that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026"><u>GTA 6 has a proper release date</u></a>, Devolver Digital has announced plans to release a mystery title on that same May 26 date. It’s a chaotic marketing strategy that Devolver Digital seems serious about following through on at least for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mystery game’s release date arrives after the company previously made the promise to launch a game of its own when Rockstar finally announced its long-awaited GTA 6 release date. We now know that date to be May 26 of next year, so naturally, Devolver Digital has a message: “You can’t escape us.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Devolver Digital (@devolverdigital) <a href="https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1918277581167907305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Devolver Digital has an extensive library of smaller-scale titles such as Hotline Miami, Enter the Gungeon, The Messenger, Katana Zero, Cult of the Lamb, and more. Whether the company plans to release a follow-up to an existing series or something new entirely remains to be seen. Upcoming entries in its catalog of games include Baby Steps and Stick It to the Stickman, two projects that are due out before 2025 comes to an end. There’s also Enter the Gungeon 2 and Human Fall Flat 2, which are both expected to arrive sometime in 2026, though developer No Brakes Games has already <a href="https://x.com/HumanFallFlat/status/1918321438450434355" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assured fans</a> that it has no intention of releasing the latter on May 26.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We can confirm that Human Fall Flat 2 will NOT be releasing on May 26, 2026 <a href="https://t.co/zl3GbjSmia" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/zl3GbjSmia</a></p>— Human Fall Flat (@HumanFallFlat) <a href="https://twitter.com/HumanFallFlat/status/1918321438450434355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">More than a year out from launch, GTA 6 is already positioned to be a juggernaut video game. It’ll be Rockstar’s first numbered entry in its critically acclaimed sandbox series since 2013, with many doing everything they can to ensure they’ll be able to play on day one. Devolver Digital is doing its best to get a slice of that pie in a very Devolver Digital way, but we’ll have to wait to see exactly how it will do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history"><u>Rockstar’s history of delaying it big-budget releases</u></a>.

From legacy boxes to recent releases, many of these products are coming in over MSRP, which is why I want to let readers know that retailers putting pricing up isn't their only option during Pokémania 2025. TCG Player is a secondary marketplace that is widely used in the US for the gold standard on current Pokémon TCG values thanks to its value tracking across the secondary market. Let's get into it, regardless of ripping open booster packs or finding that dream chase card:</p><div id="218685" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="e3df206f-2b99-4347-afac-38395c81c6ca"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Free to Play VR Sandbox Game: DigiGods on Meta Quest</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>DigiGods is a free-to-play, physics-based, VR game that allows players to create, play, and share in a sandbox environment.

Think "XCOM meets Hunt: Showdown with a dash of Cthulhu thrown in." Check out the announcement trailer above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers describe the setup for Nightmare Frontier as follows: "The story of Nightmare Frontier unfolds in an alternate version of 19th-century America, shortly after a mysterious event that forever changed the world. The line between reality and an unknown horror has started to fade, and those who remain are left to uncover what truly happened that night – and what’s behind the titular Nightmare. The streets were overrun by monsters emerging from the dark abysses of the terror dimension – the survivors called these creatures Dreadweavers. These beings are the physical embodiment of people's deepest fears. Players will step into the shoes of the ringleader, who, despite overwhelming terror, finds a chance for survival in this new reality. Leading other scavengers, they venture deep into the city, risking everything they have left in search of loot."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nightmare Frontier - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightmare Frontier aims to mix turn-based "gun-n-slash" gameplay with gameplay-altering horror, an enticing risk-reward system, and alluring loot. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3310950/Nightmare_Frontier/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wishlist</a> Nightmare Frontier on Steam if you're interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.
