Silver Tempest is in a unique position right now, with single card prices soaring and stock set to run out by the end of 2025. It's also one of the cheapest sets to collect right now, with Elite Trainer Boxes dipping just <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q41Pm4?object_uuid=2204cbc4-1662-4060-95a2-3685c5b1d5c1&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">below £40 at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/a0nJ0A?object_uuid=2204cbc4-1662-4060-95a2-3685c5b1d5c1&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zavvi</a>. But why Silver Tempest specifically? Let's look at the insane pulls this Sword and Shield era expansion delivers.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">UK Deals: I'm Buying Silver Tempest Before It Goes Out Of Stock</h2></p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lugia V 186/195 (Alt Art)</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/18/untitled-design-37-1737198578010.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company / Creatures Inc</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is hands down the best Lugia Pokémon card out there; look at that amazing artwork! Whilst being playable to quickly get through a deck, this is one for the collectors. Lugia V Alt Art is starting to climb in value, from around £150 on the secondary market at the end of 2024 to around the £230 mark at the time of writing. There's every chance to still pull one of these bad boys in Silver Tempest products on store shelves right now.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rayquaza VMAX TG20/TG30 (Trainer Gallery)</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/18/untitled-design-38-1737199148668.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company / Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Honourable Silver Tempest Mentions</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">- Lugia VSTAR 202/195 (Rainbow Rare)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Unown V 177/195 (Alt Art)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Regidrago V 184/195 (Alt Art)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Trainer Gallery Cards, the artwork is stunning on them all</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trainer Gallery cards are still very cheap for the most part (usually under £5), so I'd highly recommend picking them up. They're stunning, and their value will only climb as time goes on. Plus, they're so fun to collect. Rayquaza Vmax is stunning, rocking its Dragon Clan routes whilst considering how massive this Pokémon is. This card has nearly tripled in value from the back end of 2024, with sold listings from December going for as low as £25. Most recent sales are going for between £60 to £80, and I don't see that price getting any cheaper as 2025 progresses.</p><p id="pokemon-tcg-sword-shield-12-silve"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG: Sword &amp; Shield 12 Silve">Pokemon TCG: Sword &amp; Shield 12 Silver Tempest Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="fd330157-bb0b-4b85-8799-f783a6c351cf" id="214259"><div id="214259" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Sword &amp; Shield—Silver Tempest Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">8 booster packs of Silver Tempest, Alolan Vulpix sleeves, dice, damage counters, and a cool box to store your bulk are a solid deal for £39.99. Unfortunately, this is the dark times before every ETB has a cool promo card, but it's still a sweet deal. It's also probably a good idea to keep one sealed if you're a collector; the value for these will certainly rise as stock runs out in stores.</p></div><p id="pokmon-sword-shieldsilver-tempe"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield—Silver Tempe"> Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield—Silver Tempest Build &amp; Battle Stadium </h2></p><div catalogid="fd330157-bb0b-4b85-8799-f783a6c351cf" id="214260"><div id="214260" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield—Silver Tempest Build &amp; Battle Stadium </h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For an extra £20 over the Silver Tempest ETB, trainers can snag 12 booster packs, two 40-card build and battle decks, extra energy cards, damage counter dice, coins, and status markers. There's also a foil promo card. It's certainly worth the extra few quid to pony up. It is perfect for trainers wanting everything they need to start battling with one handy product.</p></div><p id="pokmon-silver-tempest-triple-pack"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon Silver Tempest Triple Pack"> Pokémon Silver Tempest Triple Pack</h2></p><div catalogid="fd330157-bb0b-4b85-8799-f783a6c351cf" id="214261"><div id="214261" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon Silver Tempest Triple Pack</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for cheap Silver Tempest pulls? The triple booster blister packs are a good deal at £12.99, with a cool promo card and game-legal coin to sweeten the deal. Buying three will get you one extra booster over elite trainer boxes for £1 less. If you're not bothered about the ETB swag, this one's for you.</p></div><p id="pokemon-tcg-sword-shield-12-silve"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG: Sword &amp; Shield 12 Silve">Pokemon TCG: Sword &amp; Shield 12 Silver Tempest Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="fd330157-bb0b-4b85-8799-f783a6c351cf" id="214262"><div id="214262" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG: Sword &amp; Shield 12 Silver Tempest Elite Trainer Box</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Use Code "POKE20" for 20% off Pokémon TCG</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">An honourable mention goes to Zavvi as they've got a sale going this weekend with 20% off in-stock Pokémon TCG products. This brings down the Silver Tempest ETB to the same price as Amazon, but adding more products to your basket means a solid deal for any trainers looking to stock up on other Scarlet and Violet boxed products.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

Levine adds that companies that utilize "these dark-pattern tactics will be held accountable" if they decieve players, especially young children and teens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main charges against Hoyoverse by the FTC is that they allege the developer violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule by marketing Genshin Impact to children and collected their personal information, as well as deceive players about the odds of winning "five-star" loot box prizes, and how much it would cost to open a loot box int he first place. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The FTC claims the virtual currency system in Genshin Impact were confusing and unfair, and ultimately the system obscures the fact that players will ultimately spend large amounts of money to obtain "five-star prizes" and that children have spent hundreds to thousands of dollars to win them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the fine and the ban, Hoyoverse will be required to disclose loot box odds and exchange rates for its virtual currency, delete personal information collected from children under the age of 13, and comply with COPPA rules going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

We've got all the active and working Lootify codes for January 2025, which will let you claim free coins and potions so you can level up your character quicker in the Roblox action RPG.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/17/lootify-codes-1737109752191.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Active Lootify Codes (January 2025)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are all the active Lootify codes in January 2025 and the rewards you can get for redeeming them:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>COIN</strong> - 1,000 coins</li><li><strong>DISCORD20K</strong> - 4x Coin Potion I, 4x EXP Potion I, 4x Luck Potion I, 4x Roll Speed Potion I</li><li><strong>POTION</strong> - 1x Coin Potion 2, 1x EXP Potion 2, 1x EXP Potion 2, 1x Roll Speed Potion 2</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">All Expired Lootify Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Below, you'll find a list of expired Lootify codes that no longer work and cannot be redeemed as of January 2025:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>POWERFIXED</li><li>LOOTIFYHYPEHYPE</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Redeem Lootify Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Tto redeem codes in Lootify. follow the steps below:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Open the Lootify Roblox Experience.</li><li>Select the cog button in the top-right corner.</li><li>Enter your code in the "code..." field.</li><li>Check for any spelling errors or mistakes.</li><li>Click the "Confirm" button to redeem the code.</li></ol><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/17/lootify-settings-button-1737111277210.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/17/lootify-codes-menu-1737111353295.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Isn't My Lootify Code Working?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If the code you're trying to redeem in Lootify isn't working, it's likely due to one of two reasons. If there's a spelling mistake in the code then in won't work. Double check there isn't a typo, and also see if capital letters are in the right places as Roblox codes can be case sensitive too!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you checked and everything is correct then that means the code is unfortunately no longer working. Roblox codes tend to be time-sensitive, and are only active for a limited amount of time. So if you see a code you like the look of, don't delay in redeeming it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Get More Lootify Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">New Lootify codes are shared by the developer Yes Madam on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/AW9EMShwQJ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Lootify Discord server</a>. While we check for new Lootify codes regularly, the quickest way to get new codes is to sign up to the experience's Discord, where you'll be able to see the latest codes posted in real-time. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Lootify in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Lootify is an action RPG with a Dark Souls feel to it. The Roblox experience makes you face off against groups of fantasy-inspired enemies, which at first seem overpowered and tough to defeat. When you die, a FromSoftware-style "You Died" screen even appears! Like the Souls games, you can grind for EXP to level up your character and make them more powerful. But the best way to get stronger is via the game's loot mechanic, which lets you keep opening chests to try and find better gear to power up your character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Dion has spent over five years doing games journalism for UK national newspaper websites and is now a writer for Gamer Network.
