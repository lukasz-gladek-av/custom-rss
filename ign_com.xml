            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">“Here be monsters,” says the legend on so many antique maps, firing the imagination with thoughts of kraken, chimeras, or worse. But what if it were true? What if Lewis and Clarke, setting out on their expedition across the American interior, encountered buffalo-headed minotaurs and man-eating plants. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the premise of the Corps of Discovery comic and now of this board game adaptation. The game comes from the same designers as the superb <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mind-mgmt-board-game-review"><u>Mind MGMT</u></a>, although, save for the comic book connection, this is a very different kind of game.</p><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box">What’s in the Box</h2></p><div catalogid="a6a6c32d-c46f-44a3-834e-97a927e776f1" id="225555"><div id="225555" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Corps of Discovery</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Most box-openings start with a board, and Corps of Discovery is no exception, but the nature of the board itself is rather surprising. Instead of the usual fold-out affair, you get a cardboard sandwich: two layers of card stuck together, with room in between to slip in a sheet of paper. The top layer is punctuated by a regular grid of circular holes, and the box contains an equally unusual supply of thick cardboard sun tokens with wide “pegs” that fit loosely into the grid's holes.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250628-145130883-1753125741072.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two folders of paper maps that slide into the sandwich, one for each of the two scenarios included in the game. There’s also a second board which is used for tracking the current game state, with spaces for three challenge cards, backpack items and water: this doubles as a handy reminder of the flow of each game day. There are tokens for the various resources that go in your backpack and for your water supply. There are also several card decks, not only the challenge cards that’ll outline the obstacles you must overcome each day, but also characters to play, items for them to use and so on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a scenario-based game, there are also additional cards and tokens applicable to particular scenarios. One thing to note is that, as a game based on a comic book series, all the components are furnished with excellent art from the original comics. While it might not be to everyone’s tastes, it does a fantastic job of bringing the game’s dangerous world to life, especially if you’re familiar with the source material.</p></div><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How It Plays</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250707-191631962-mp-1753126200486.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Understanding how the game is set up is, unusually, an integral part of understanding how it plays. First, your group chooses one of the two scenarios to play (plus a training mission), and one of the 10 map sheets included for that scenario, covering it with a blank sheet so you can’t see what’s on it. You slip this, cover and all, into the cardboard-sandwich board then cover all the holes with the sun tokens. Then you slip out the blank sheet. The result is a game map that you know nothing about, ripe for exploration and discovery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games"><u>cooperative game</u></a> where you’re working together to map the wilderness and survive. On your individual turn, you simply remove a sun token, revealing an icon underneath, and take a matching resource to add to your collective backpack. There’s no piece to mark where you are on the map. Instead, movement is abstracted away under the presumption that it’s easy to move through already explored territory. The next player just removes a sun token next to any already-revealed space, although there are some mountainous areas on each map that you can’t traverse.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250707-191556654-1753126158243.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploration, however, is far from a random walk in the park. Each scenario has a set of rules about where and how the various different icons are laid out. In the Fauna scenario, for example, there’s always one wood icon per row and column, and there will always be a water icon orthogonally adjacent to each wood. Each mud icon will be next to a water and a stone, while forts always form an L-shape series with a water and a skull. There are more rules – and icons – but you get the idea.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This allows you to make predictions and deductions about what you’re going to encounter on the map. Sometimes you can figure it out with complete certainty, but more often it’s a bit of a gamble, where you can narrow down the odds without being sure. Exploration is thus both a fun puzzle where you can aim for specific resources, and an exercise loaded with tension. The rules are complex enough to make it a good group discussion, ensuring there’s a dynamic sense of cooperation, and something you can master with practice. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The rules are complex enough to make it a good group discussion, ensuring there’s a dynamic sense of cooperation, and something you can master with practice.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each time you remove a sun token from the board you place it on one of three challenge cards dealt at the start of the game day. These cards have a resource requirement that you must spend in order to pass the challenge and a consequence for passing or failing, the latter of which usually means losing even more, different resources. You have to face these consequences once the card accumulates a certain number of suns, often only two or three. Considering many challenges require more than two or three resources to pass, this immediately puts your game under massive pressure to find the right icons on every turn.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250707-190121214-1753125922112.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you run out of water tokens, you die. If you end the day – timing out the three challenge cards for that die – without any food tokens, you die. Monsters generally don’t kill you outright but sap these precious, precious resource tokens until you die. Even when you’re on top of the resource-mapping system, most games will go down to the wire of you gaining your objective with a few measly drops of water left in your canteen. The last few turns ramp up the tension to crushing levels, until it almost feels like you’re struggling through a real wilderness, desperately following signs of water in the hope of surviving just one more day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As if this wasn’t enough, on top of surviving you also have a goal to complete. This depends on the scenario. In Fauna, for instance, you’ll meet those buffalo-headed minotaurs who’ll make it harder to traverse rows and columns until you find a fort, learn a recipe for killing one, and sacrifice the necessary resources, all of which you were probably hoping to save to pass a challenge card. These kinds of trade-offs are part of the game’s strategy: identifying times when failing a daily challenge can be a useful step in the wider goal of passing the winning objectives.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250628-145141636-1753125839302.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other aspects of your decision-making come down to the characters in play and the gear you choose at the outset, all of which offer you special abilities to piece together and increase your chance of survival. You can plan ahead with these since you pick them yourself, look for combos, and build a strategy around them. But there are also destiny cards, random helpful bonuses that you can sometimes replenish by achieving in-game goals, and for these you’ll have to roll with whatever fate gives you, adjusting your tactics accordingly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With practice and luck you will, eventually, manage to beat Fauna and, in time, the game’s second scenario, Flora, which involves a giant carnivorous plant. Corps of Discovery goes out of its way to make these scenarios replayable by offering such a huge range of map sheets – you can also download and print out more – that memorising the layouts is essentially impossible. Variety, however, cannot fully undermine human psychology: there’s an innate tendency to treat a mission as “done” once it’s been won. This is exacerbated by the game’s high difficulty level and lack of narrative detail. Although it does a great job of conjuring up the spectre of starving in the wilderness, the challenge cards feel pretty mechanical, so repeated tries at a scenario can feel a little same-y.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250707-191508329-1753126054718.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t quite the limiting factor it may sound like as it’ll take you repeated attempts to win both the scenarios, and there are expansions available which further the story and build considerably on the core mechanics – all four are included in the deluxe edition, which we used for the photos accompanying this review. But it still would have felt like a more complete experience if more of these elements had been included in the base game. As it stands, the game’s high toughness is the major motivation for a replay, and it’s almost enough by itself: winning against the odds, in a land where almost everything you encounter is out to kill you, is a hugely satisfying moment.</p><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBgxA8?object_uuid=efb277a0-a370-437f-878b-a449b5653b6a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8e8O?object_uuid=efb277a0-a370-437f-878b-a449b5653b6a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Miniature Market</a></li></ul></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 23, 2025 5:36 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Corps of Discovery’s core concept of exploring and surviving in unknown, hostile terrain is a strong one, and it’s well executed with some novel mechanical ideas. Each play feels like a gruelling crawl across the wilderness, just as it should, and it feels very rewarding when you manage to eke out a win. As strong as this central pillar is, however, the core of the game lacks much in the way of support from narrative, player interaction, or variety, particularly given the sparse supply of different scenarios to play, so it might not return to your table as often as it should.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-corps-of-discovery-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

It costs 7 to Station and is a 5/5 in its own right (with Flying).</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Esika’s Chariot</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225657"><div id="225657" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Esika’s Chariot</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One for the cat lovers, <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxlZ4?object_uuid=75ca9cc3-68af-413b-8e65-01127207d870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Esika’s Chariot</u></a> is a four-cost 4/4 that requires 4 to Crew, but can create tokens when it arrives, and then copy additional tokens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tie it in with Doubling Season and your go-wide strategy can be, uh, wider than ever, creating four tokens when it enters, and then duplicating more when it attacks. More kitties, more chaos.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Entropic Battlecruiser</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225658"><div id="225658" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Entropic Battlecruiser</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh boy, where to start?

Potentially, but we reckon it’s worth it for those people who love to mess with their opponents’ hands.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Exploration Broodship</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225659"><div id="225659" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Exploration Broodship</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve been looking for a fresh Landfall Commander, this could be it.

It’s found in the World Shaper Commander Deck, if you’re picking that one up.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">RMS Titanic</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225660"><div id="225660" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering RMS Titanic</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As soon as the rules change was announced, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAKZj?object_uuid=75ca9cc3-68af-413b-8e65-01127207d870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>RMS Titanic</u></a> from the Doctor Who set saw a lot of love, and it’s understandable for what could be a pretty fun (if not entirely functional) Commander.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a 7/1 with a relatively low crew cost, and only costs four mana to bring into play. It’ll also act as a Treasure token engine, has flying and trample. We’d imagine the play here will be buffing it as much as possible to then make a whole host of tokens, which you can then use to bring it back into play with the Commander tax.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Last Ride</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225661"><div id="225661" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering The Last Ride</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another one that could be great fun as a literal last-hurrah, this one-mana black Legendary Vehicle from Aetherdrift (that set feels a while ago, right?) could have meme potential.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OvwD?object_uuid=75ca9cc3-68af-413b-8e65-01127207d870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>The Last Ride</u></a> is strongest the closer you are to death, and being able to roll it out from your Command zone to hit an opponent for big numbers is the kind of chaos we’re here for.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Indomitable</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225662"><div id="225662" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering The Indomitable</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Fancy building a Pirate deck?

That may suit you just fine, but it’s worth mentioning.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering’s Spacecraft explained</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Spacecraft make their debut in Edge of Eternities as a new Artifact Subtype. The idea is that your ship uses its ‘Station’ ability to pick up crew. Once you reach the required number of charge counters (calculated from the power of the cards you use to ‘Station’), your ship becomes an Artifact Creature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wurmwall Sweeper, for example, needs to be crewed by four or more, so using ‘Station’ to put a couple of 2/2s in there would work nicely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wizards puts it best in <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/edge-of-eternities-mechanics" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>its mechanics blog</u></a>: “If Wurmwall Sweeper has three charge counters on it, it's not a creature and it doesn't have flying. Once it gets its fourth charge counter, it becomes a 2/2 artifact creature with flying.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Magic: The Gathering's Edge of Eternities Set</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Ready to head to a whole new galaxy?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of EA's full <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/untitled-battlefield-game">Battlefield 6</a> reveal tomorrow, a brief teaser for the game's campaign has been posted online, revealing a major conflict. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in the near future, Battlefield 6's campaign will see NATO under attack. Its base in Georgia is hit, the British territory of Gibraltar is invaded, and NATO's secretary general is assassinated inside the organisation's Brussels headquarters. The perpetrator? An organisation named Pax Armata. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A number of countries, including France, are then confirmed to have left NATO to form a new coalition, as in-universe news headlines question whether NATO itself is now a "thing of the past". Hmm...</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The teaser then concludes with Battlefield's trademark theme — you know the one, that 'dun dun dun dun dun' drumbeat — and a reminder that the game's full reveal will take place tomorrow, July 24, at 8am Pacific / 4pm UK time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eagle-eyed viewers will spot the logo for "BF Studios" on the end of the teaser — this is the coalition of developers that EA has pulled together to work on the game, including franchise founder DICE, Los Angeles-based sister studio Ripple Effect, Montreal-based Dead Space Remake developer Motive, and British Need for Speed studio Criterion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also the note that "no weapon, military vehicle or gear manufacturer is affiliated with or has sponsored or endorsed this game."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Battlefield (@Battlefield) <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1948035690836447674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"Pax Armata rises as NATO cracks," a message posted on Battlefield's X / Twitter account reads. "Their motto? 'Our protection, your peace.' But who’s pulling the strings and to what end?" Presumably we'll find out more tomorrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In recent months, footage of Battlefield 6 from various closed playtests has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-early-battlefield-6-footage-seems-to-have-leaked-online">started leaking online,</a> showing the game's modern setting, various firefights, destructible environments, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-improvements-and-features-revealed-by-the-battlefield-6-gameplay-leaks">quality of life improvements</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-battlefield-leak-reveals-extremely-brief-look-at-the-start-of-a-battle-royale-match-as-ea-issues-takedowns">start of a battle royale match</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 is currently slated to launch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-expected-fiscal-year-2026">sometime during the current fiscal year</a>, before March 2026. It seems likely we'll see that window narrowed considerably when the game is fully unveiled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
