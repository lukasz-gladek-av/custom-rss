            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Beware of what you're about to unleash.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Uh oh, Geoff Keighley is teasing Hollow Knight: Silksong at Gamescom Opening Night Live. Is it...finally time? Dare we hope?</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1957492830374650018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">If that above post means nothing to you, you've managed to steer clear of the Hollow Knight: Silksong fervor for years now, somehow. Since 2021, Hollow Knight fans have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-the-story-behind-the-insanely-long-wait-clown-meme">used images and emojis of clowns</a> (and specifically, the one right below) to goof about their constant hope for news about Silksong, especially around big presentations like Nintendo Directs, The Game Awards, or Summer Game Fest. Every time a new presentation rolled around, Silksong fans would post clown images and joke about putting on clown makeup, effectively acknowledging that it was cartoonish to hope for Silksong news but that they were hoping anyway.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/18/234-1755542983064.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Keighley could just be posting himself in a clown outfit for the heck of it, but I can't imagine that would be advisable given the fervor of the Silksong audience. Earlier this year, fans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake">went nuts over a chocolate cake recipe</a>, in a move which went so far as to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-insists-the-game-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-as-fans-obsess-over-a-picture-of-chocolate-cake">force the developers to make a statement</a>, so teasing that audience probably isn't the best idea.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Keighley's tease seems like a pretty sure thing. We know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-makes-brief-appearance-during-nintendo-switch-2-direct-to-secure-2025-release-window">Silksong is coming out in 2025 barring any unexpected delays</a>, and there's a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-has-a-new-hollow-knight-silksong-demo-playable-at-gamescom">demo of the game playable on the show floor</a> of Gamescom this week. We also know, via a leak, that the ROG Xbox Ally will launch on October 16, and Xbox's Sarah Bond has previously stated that Silksong <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/retail-leak-reveals-rog-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date">would be on the system when it launched</a>. If everyone's telling the truth and there have been no last-minute changes, that means Silksong should be out in the next two months sometime. And that would also mean we're due for an actual, real, confirmed release date any second now. Who's got a big showcase going on where such an announcement would make a huge splash? Keighley, of course.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, there's always a chance that we're all just putting on our clown makeup today only to be disappointed once again tomorrow. Grab a slice of chocolate cake, stick on that rubber nose, and let's lock in for Opening Night Live tomorrow. Silksong silksoon?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social. Got a story tip?

Like its Special Illustration Rare counterpart, this card has Trade, one of the strongest card draw abilities in the game. With its golden finish and historical relevance to classic Zoroark GX decks, this is a solid budget-friendly option for players and collectors alike.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Articuno – 161/159 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226583"><div id="226583" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Articuno - 161/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Illustration Rare version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/a03dbp?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Articuno</a> brings a stunning frozen aesthetic to match its sharp blue colouring, blending a simultaneous sense of camouflage and elegance. As for gameplay, Frigid Fluttering offers decent early-game acceleration in Water decks, but it’s the artwork that carries the value here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re a fan of the original legendary bird trio, this is a must-have.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Volcanion ex – 182/159 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226582"><div id="226582" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Volcanion ex - 182/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With Akagi behind the brush to bring back their striking art style, it’s no surprise this card is climbing in value.

Hop’s Zacian ex – 186/159 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226581"><div id="226581" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hop's Zacian ex - 186/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Zacian continues its streak as a playable and collectable legend. This version, partnered with Hop, features a charming and relaxing forest scene, which comes off as an interesting tonal shift from previous Zacian cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7Oqp7?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hop's Zacian ex</a> is still testing its footing competitively, as well, but fans of Galar’s rivals with the cash to spare will likely scoop this one up based on narrative and nostalgia alone.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. N’s Zoroark ex – 185/159 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226580"><div id="226580" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>N's Zoroark ex - 185/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like its Hyper Rare equivalent, this SIR version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAdLD?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">N’s Zoroark ex</a> is one of the most competitively viable cards in the set. Trade is still an exceptional ability, but its slick artwork doubles the appeal, with N and Zoroark standing ominously under a moody spotlight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, with this one’s much higher value, we’d recommend keeping this version of N’s Zoroark in your folder if you have one of the cheaper versions for your deck.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3.

It’s not the most practical card in the meta due to its high energy costs, but its nostalgic pull and sweeping museum-grade artwork have given it a big lift in value.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Lillie’s Clefairy ex – 184/159 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226577"><div id="226577" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lillie's Clefairy ex - 184/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Journey Together set’s crown jewel in price is, unsurprisingly, a Lillie card with a $125+ value at the time of writing.
