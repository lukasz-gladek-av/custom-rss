Everything that we have talked about is still in development. We will share information on upcoming games when we have something cool to share.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most obvious subject of Willits’ statement is the KOTOR remake, which remains one of gaming’s most elusive projects. Announced in 2021, the long-awaited remake has changed hands multiple times, seemingly stopped development and restarted again, and after four years has failed to materialize.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In April 2024, Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-says-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well">the company took KOTOR with it during its split from Embracer Group</a>, and that the game was still in active development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's clear and it's obvious that we're working on this," he said at the time. "It's been in the press numerous times. What I will say is that the game is alive and well, and we're dedicated to making sure we exceed consumer expectations."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Willits’ statement, which comes nearly 12 months later, reaffirms Karch’s quote. But still, even now, we have seen nothing of the KOTOR remake beyond its initial announcement video.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Saber also has other games in the works, including a number due out this year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/john-carpenters-toxic-commando">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/jurassic-park-survival">Jurassic Park Survival</a> are still down for 2025, but neither has a release date. Saber is also working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/turok-returning-as-a-co-op-dinosaur-hunting-action-game-and-ditching-first-person-the-game-awards-2024">a brand new Turok game</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-is-getting-a-aaa-rpg-with-saber-interactive-and-paramount-game-studios-exclusive">an untitled Avatar: The Last Airbender title</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, you can add Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 to the list.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-fans-wildly-speculate-on-why-legends-z-a-has-an-e10-rating<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">What's happening in Lumiose?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">We recently saw a good look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, the next entry in Game Freak's Legends series set to take place in X and Y's Lumiose City. It's also apparently garnered an E10+ rating from the ESRB, and fans are both curious and wildly, sometimes jokingly, speculating about what's going to happen in this new entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Attentive fans noticed that on the Nintendo Switch store page, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has earned an E10+ age rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board, listing 'Fantasy Violence.' While it might not normally draw feverish speculation for most other series, it's an oddity for Pokémon, whose mainline games have consistently been 'E for Everyone.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rating has, of course, drawn wild speculation, some serious and some less-than-serious. It is genuinely entertaining to think about what strange choices Game Freak could possibly have made to bump up the rating, whether that be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonZA/comments/1j98yr1/comment/mhbp8h8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dialogue about Pokémon killing people</a> or trying to <a href="https://x.com/UltimaShadowX/status/1900202998942376277" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add a gunplay mechanic</a>. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonZA/comments/1j98yr1/comment/mhc4f58/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several Redditors (jokingly) suggest</a>, maybe the hordes come back, but it involves a group of Scrafty jumping you in one of Lumiose's alleys.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ohhhh boy, Game Freak is taking off the little kiddie gloves," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonZA/comments/1j98yr1/comment/mhcdicu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user RynnHamHam</a> said. "This ain’t your kindergartener’s Pokémon game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Several gags have also been made about AZ, a character with quite a history set to appear in Pokémon Legends: Z-A and who plays a central role in some of the darker elements of Pokémon X and Y's story and the history of the Kalos region.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for more plausible speculation, there are a few theories, including <a href="https://x.com/ShirtxX/status/1900356386300567864" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a few more</a> "craps" than usual, or the appearance of a Game Center-style minigame. Even the darker elements of Lumiose could be more front-and-center.</p><div id="the-10-best-dog-pokmon-of-all-time" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">The 10 best dog Pokémon of all time</h3><h3>The 10 best dog Pokémon of all time</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My personal take is that this probably lies in the 'Fantasy Violence' the ESRB highlighted. While the rating is an oddity for your typical Pokémon game, it <em>does </em>line up with the pocket monster fighting game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokken-tournament-dx">Pokkén Tournament DX</a>, which also received an E10+ and noted 'Fantasy Violence.' The real-time elements <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-first-trailer-reveals-rooftop-running-gameplay-and-late-2025-release-window">showcased for Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> could have elicited the slightly stronger rating, as the monsters more clearly make contact.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no listing, as of this writing, for Pokémon Legends: Z-A on the ESRB site, so we can't learn much more at this time. Still, it's fun to speculate a bit, at least until we know more about Z-A's ultimate plans and how it will earn that bump-up in the E range.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends: Z-A is slated for a late 2025 launch on Nintendo Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
