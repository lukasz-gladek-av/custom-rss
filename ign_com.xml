            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The London hub is getting a Kairos flavoured makeover</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the <em>least</em> eagle-eyed of commuters will spot something different about London Waterloo station at the end of this week. To celebrate the highly-anticipated launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> this Friday (12th September), 2K are unleashing a huge takeover of the capital's transport hub across the weekend, with game imagery, interactive elements and a tonne of loot flooding the space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On your approach, look out for a number of billboards between the BFI IMAX and the station, featuring spoof fragrance ads and a Ripper bursting through the glass on the side of the railway bridge. As well as 3D chains and shards, this poster lights up, with the character's eyes glowing throughout the night.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the main concourse, the massive digital screens will feature character art and the game's "break free" messaging, while cosplayers decked out in Vault Hunter gear roam amongst the crowds, interacting with passers by. Head down to get your hands on your very own Ripper mask and a share of the free Borderlands 4 merch on offer, including hoodies, t-shirts, caps, Claptrap totes, lanyards and keyrings.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/10/roadside-special-build-1757492892927.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The 3D Borderlands 4 billboard outside London Waterloo station</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also set to be two Snapchat experiences live across both Friday and Saturday. Activate an AR lens to transform head to toe into a Ripper, and try your luck with an interactive vending machine, which will be spitting out prizes for those who score enough points in its integrated Borderlands 4 mini-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The domination will continue at the tube line level, with wanted posters and wraps spouting "Keep Order" propaganda on behalf of the game's villain, The Timekeeper. Resistance will of course peek through, with signature Borderlands-style graffiti and artwork plastered across the walls and ticket barriers, showing rebellious Rippers breaking free from their shackles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Kairos influence extends down the escalators, with The Timekeeper watching over the summit, and Synths following passengers down on the digital screens. Even the travelator linking the Bakerloo, Jubilee and Northern lines has a Borderlands flourish, courtesy of Claptrap himself.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before you reach the platforms, you'll be able to walk through a floor to ceiling immersive scene in the connecting tube tunnels. Be sure to keep an eye out for other underground ads which may have been given the Borderlands 4 treatment…</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The full Borderlands 4 takeover experience will be live at Waterloo Station throughout September 12-13. The game’s official release date is September 12 2025, but check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-global-release-times-confirmed"><u>global release time round up</u></a> for info on availability across PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch 2.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-rips-through-waterloo-station]]></content:encoded>
