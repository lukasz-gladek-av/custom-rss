            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/civ-7-best-antiquity-civs-tier-list<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Civilization 7's Antiquity Age is all about setting up your empire's foundation. Winners and losers aren’t decided until the Modern Age, but if you can get a solid early advantage, you'll be even stronger when the finish line approaches. Because of that, you’re going to want a strong start, and choosing the right civilization is key to that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Antiquity Age offers ten civilizations for you and your Leader to choose from. To help make your selection easier, here’s our Civ 7 Antiquity Civilizations tier list.</p><div id="best-civ-7-antiquity-civs" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Civ 7 Antiquity Civs</h3><h3>Best Civ 7 Antiquity Civs</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Civ 7 Antiquity Civs Tier List</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>S:</strong> Persia, Han, Greece</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> Rome, Mississipian, Maurya </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>B:</strong> Aksum, Egypt, Maya</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>C:</strong> Khmer</p><h3 data-cy="title3">S-Tier Antiquity Civs</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-persia-1739982429788.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>S - Persia</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Hamarana Council</strong> - Infantry Units receive +3 Combat Strength when attacking. +30% Production towards constructing the Gate of All Nations.</li><li><strong>Immortal</strong> - Persian Unique Infantry. Heals 15 HP after defeating an enemy Unit.</li><li><strong>Hazarapatis</strong> - Persian Unique Army Commander. Starts with the Initiative Promotion.</li><li><strong>Pairidaeza</strong> - +1 Culture and Gold. Persian Unique Improvement. Ageless. Does not remove Warehouse bonuses on a tile. Cannot be placed adjacent to another Pairidaeza.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Persia is the quintessential military-minded civilization for the Antiquity Age. A great choice for those who want to be aggressive, get out early, and take over other Settlements. The +3 bonus to all attacking Infantry is a welcome buff, and since Immortals heal after defeating enemies, this creates a great synergy that allows you to continue your assaults with more sustain. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Claiming land early is so important in this Age, and a strong military will help you take your rivals’ lands and defend your territory. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Persia lacks some of the multi-layered dimensionality of other civilizations that get nice Districts and Builds to bring varied yields, sometimes a battering ram solves all problems. Plus, you can always just take over your rivals' established cities and benefit from their bonuses, too.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-han-1739982461508.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>S - Han</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Nine Provinces</strong> - The Capital and new Towns gain an additional Population with their first growth event. +30% Production towards constructing Weiyang Palace.</li><li><strong>Chu-Ko-Nu</strong> - Han Unique Ranged Unit. Has Zone of Control and a higher Defense Strength. +5 Combat Strength when attacking adjacent Units.</li><li><strong>Shi Dafu</strong> - Shi Dafu: A Great Person with one charge. Can only be trained in Cities with at least 10 Population, and the specific Shi Dafu can only be received once. Cost increases per Shi Dafu trained.</li><li><strong>Great Wall</strong> - +2 Culture. +1 Happiness for adjacent Great Wall segments. Han Unique Improvement. Ageless. Counts as Fortification, +6 Combat Strength when defending. Does not remove Warehouse bonuses on a tile. Can only be built in a line. Cannot branch or fork.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Han allows you to build your borders without getting aggressive and taking Settlements from your fellow civilizations. Getting extra population will help spread your borders and claim key resources within your vicinity early on. This can be a very powerful strategy, especially if you can keep this growth exploding with an abundance of Food. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s nice though, is that Han is also self-protecting. While your Settlements explode in population, the Chu-Ko-Nu is an exceptional defensive ranged unit that will stop any militaristic-minded Civilizations who might try to take your land off of you. The Great Wall is also an excellent defensive structure that brings the benefit of a boost to Culture and Happiness too. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-greece-1739982489897.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>S - Greece</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Demokratia</strong> - +3 Influence per turn on the Palace. +30% Production towards constructing the Oracle.</li><li><strong>Hoplite</strong> - Greek Unique Infantry Unit. +2 Combat Strength if adjacent to another Hoplite.</li><li><strong>Logios</strong> - A Great Person with one charge. Can only be trained in Cities with an Acropolis, and the specific Logios received is random, Each Logios can only be received once. Cost increases per Logios trained.</li><li><strong>Acropolis</strong> - Greek Unique Quarter. Created by constructing the Odeon and Parthenon in the same District. +2 Gold on the Parthenon for each City-State you are Suzerain of</li><li><strong>Odeon</strong> - +3 Happiness. +1 Culture Adjacency for Quarters and Wonders. Greek Unique Happiness Building. Ageless.</li><li><strong>Parthenon</strong> - +4 Culture. +2 Influence if placed on Rough Terrain. +1 Culture adjacency for Wonders. Greek Unique Culture Building. Ageless.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Greece has a lot of excellent traits that will really help you create a powerful and varied foundation. For one, Demokatia is a great source of Influence, which can be very valuable in your opening interactions with your fellow Civilizations, allowing you to have open borders for easy-to-navigate routes, as well as start various agreements to try and boost yields you might be falling short on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hoplites are a relatively strong Infantry Unit too, that, when attacking in a swarm become near impossible to overcome in the early game. They are versatile too, good on both attack and defense, just as long as you have enough resources to make and maintain several. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Greece also offers a really nice, varied selection of Unique Buildings. If you make the Acropolis by constructing an Odeon and Parthenon in the same district, all of them together will be a source of Gold, Happiness, Culture, and Influence. This gives you access to lots of yields, making Greece probably the best jack of all trades in the Antiquity Age. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier Antiquity Civs</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-rome-1739987173998.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A - Rome</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Twelve Tables</strong> - +1 Culture on Districts in the Capital and City Centers in Towns. +30% Production towards constructing the Colosseum.</li><li><strong>Legion</strong> - Roman Unique Infantry Unit. +2 Combat Strength for every Tradition in the Government.</li><li><strong>Legatus</strong> - Roman Unique Army Commander. Gains 1 charge to create a new Settlement for every 3 Levels it has.</li><li><strong>Forum</strong> - Roman Unique Quarter. Created by constructing the Basilica and Temple of Jupiter in the same District. +1 Culture and Gold for every Unique Tradition in the Government.</li><li><strong>Basilica</strong> - +4 Gold. +1 Influence Adjacency for Culture Buildings and Wonders. Roman Unique Gold Building. Ageless.</li><li><strong>Temple of Jupiter</strong> - +3 Happiness. +1 Culture Adjacency for Happiness Buildings and Wonders. Roman Unique Happiness Building. Ageless.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Rome has several advantages that are pretty straightforward to leverage. This is an excellent choice if you expect to be expanding the amount of Settlements you have quickly. +1 Culture on Districts in the Capital and City Centers can add up if you have a lot of Settlements. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, their Army Commander, the Legatus, acts as a hybrid Settler, though you will need to level them up three times to be able to make a new Settlement. However, it’s a good option that saves you the production of several Settlers. The Legion is a decent Infantry Unit, too, that can become very powerful if you are slotting Traditions into your policies. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Forum also benefits from Traditions, adding Culture and Gold for each one. You’ll likely want to be outputting a lot of Happiness, which is what the Temple of Jupiter is for. This is a relatively well rounded Civilization for those looking to play wide and enact a lot of policies.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-maurya-1739987295970.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A - Maurya</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Dhamma Lipi</strong> - You can choose an additional Pantheon after unlocking Mysticism. +30% Production towards constructing Sanchi Stupa.</li><li><strong>Purabhett</strong> - Maurya Unique Cavalry Unit. +5 Combat Strength against Fortified Districts. Ignores Zone of Control.</li><li><strong>Nagarika</strong> - Maurya Unique Settler. Civilian Unit capable of founding new Towns. Adds +2 Happiness on City Halls.</li><li><strong>Matha</strong> -  Mauryan Unique Quarters. Created by constructing the Dharamshala and Wihara in the same District. +10% Happiness in this Settlement.</li><li><strong>Dharamshala</strong> - +3 Happiness. +1 Science Adjacency for Quarters and Wonders. Mauryan Unique Happiness Building. Ageless.</li><li><strong>Vihara</strong> - +3 Happiness. +1 Culture Adjacency for Mountains and Wonders. Mauryan Unique Happiness Building. Ageless.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Maurya civilization may not jump off the page as a strong Civilization right away, but when you consider how powerful Happiness is in Civilization 7, it makes more sense. High Happiness means plenty of Celebrations and Social Policies, and if you have enough, you may even be able to ignore Settlement Caps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Matha District provides a percentage based buff on a Settlement that will scale with you through the game, and is an exceptional source of Happiness long into the future. You’ll also be getting big boosts from the Dharamshala and Vihara you needed to produce to make the district. The Nagarika will also give you that boost of Happiness when founding a new settlement. While the Purabhett can be a little situational, it’s still a decent Cavalry unit too.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-mississippian2-1739987479368.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A - Mississippian</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Goose Societies</strong> - All Buildings receive a +1 Food Adjacency for Resources. +30% Production towards constructing Monks Mound.</li><li><strong>Burning Arrow</strong> - Mississippian Unique Ranged Unit. Increased Bombard Strength. +3 Combat Strength against Siege Units. Applies the Burning status to tiles for 2 turns.</li><li><strong>Watonathi</strong> - Mississippian Unique Merchant. Civilian who can establish a Trade Route to import Resources from a foreign Settlement. Gain 25 Gold per Resource acquired when creating a Trade Route.</li><li><strong>Potkop</strong> - +1 Gold. +1 Food for each adjacent Resource. Mississippian Unique Improvement. Ageless. Does not remove Warehouse bonuses on a tile. Must be placed on Flat Terrain.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mississippian civilization ties together two powerful resources: Gold and Food. Its Goose Societies will likely align with your natural play, where you try to hoover up as many Resources as possible. If you can get your hands on a lot of them, you will see your cities growing fast. This is an excellent synergy for the Economic Legacy Path. On top of that, the Potkop will only enhance your benefits for doing so. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Burning Arrow Ranged Unit is also an excellent defensive or even hybrid Siege unit. Though you may not attack Siege units too often, the Burning status on a tile can make it really difficult for your enemy’s armies to navigate your lands and attack you. Denying that space can be a real decider in a war. It also makes it a good option to bombard Settlements too - just don’t end up burning your own troops with it. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier Antiquity Civs</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-aksum-1739981497868.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>B - Aksum</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Kingdom of Natural Wealth</strong> - +2 Gold on Resources. +30% Production towards constructing Great Stele.</li><li><strong>Dhow</strong> - A Unique Naval Unit. +4 Combat Strength on Coast. Has 1 charge to create a naval Trade Route.</li><li><strong>Tankwa</strong> - Aksum Unique Trade Ship. Cannot be pillaged. +10 Trade Route range.</li><li><strong>Hawlit</strong> - +2 Gold. +1 Culture for adjacent Wonders and other Hawilti. Aksumite Unique Improvement. Ageless. Does not remove Warehouse Bonuses on a tile. Must be placed on Flat Terrain.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want Gold, there aren’t many civilizations better at generating it than Aksum. The Kingdom of Natural Wealth trait that gives you +2 Gold for Resources can add up ridiculously quickly, making you an early-game economic powerhouse, able to buy buildings and units to ensure your cities remain modern with your technological advances. You can also build Hawlits next to each other for a further boost of Gold. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, if you find yourself landlocked, or have to travel great distances to get to other Civilizations, you may struggle to maximise your benefits. By water, the Dhow and Tankwa may not be useful in every situation. They lack a land presence that other civilizations may take advantage of with powerful unique units, and unlike Persia, their singular focus on Gold may leave you falling behind elsewhere. That said, if the going really gets tough, the Aksum can just buy themselves an army (though, this can take a couple of turns, so don’t find yourself on the back foot.)</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-egypt-1739987645342.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>B - Egypt</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Gift of Osiris</strong> - +1 Production on Navigable Rivers. +30% Production towards constructing the Pyramids.</li><li><strong>Medjay</strong> - Egyptian Unique Infantry Unit. Has no maintenance. +3 Combat Strength in friendly territory, doubled when stationed in a Settlement you own.</li><li><strong>Tjaty</strong> - A Great Person with one charge. Can only be trained in Cities with a Necropolis, and the specific Tjaty received is random. Each Tjaty can only be received once. Cost increases per Tjaty trained.</li><li><strong>Necropolis</strong> - Egyptian Unique Quarter. Created by constructing the Mastaba and Mortuary Temple in the same District. Grants 100 Gold (on Standard Speed) when any Wonder is completed in this City.</li><li><strong>Mastaba</strong> - +3 Culture. +1 Gold Adjacency for Navigable Rivers and Wonders. Egyptian Unique Culture Building. Ageless.</li><li><strong>Mortuary Temple</strong> - +4 Gold. +1 Happiness Adjacency for Navigable Rivers and Wonders. Egyptian Unique Gold Building. Ageless.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Egypt is a good Civilization. Activating their unique perks only requires a Navigable River, and since most Settlements should be on a source of water, you should generally be dandy. That said, there's nothing overpowered about Egypt. 100 Gold per Wonder on a Necropolis is nice, as are some extra Gold and Happiness for being Adjacent to Navigable Rivers from the Mastaba and Mortuary Temple. Add the Gift of Osiris, with some extra production, and Eygpt benefits from a nice collection of buffs that certainly add up to a solid package - though without ever offering anything too flashy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Medjay are a great defensive Unit too, deterring any would-be attackers from taking your Settlements. They are particularly good at withstanding pressure from an aggressive city-state, though they lack some of the offensive versatility that other unique Units offer. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-maya-1739988036895.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>B - Maya</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Skies of Itzamna</strong> - The Palace gains +0.5 Science for adjacent Vegetated Terrain. +30% Production towards constructing Mundo Perdido.</li><li><strong>Hul’che</strong> - Maya Unique Ranged Unit. Can see through Vegetation and ignore movement penalties from Vegetated Terrain.</li><li><strong>Jaguar Slayer</strong> - Maya Unique Scout. Can initiate combat. Has 1 charge to place a Jaguar Trap that is invisible to enemy Units, dealing 25 damage and ending movement. This ability recharges 5 turns after placing a trap.</li><li><strong>Uwaybil K’uh</strong> - Mayan Unique Quarter. Created by Constructing the Jalaw and K’uh Nah in the same District. Every time you research a Technology, the Settlement gains Production equal to 15% of it’s cost. </li><li><strong>Jalaw</strong> - +3 Happiness. +1 Culture Adjacency for Quarters and Wonders. Mayan Unique Happiness Building. Ageless.</li><li><strong>K’uh Nah</strong> - +3 Science. +2 Science if placed on Vegetation. +1 Science Adjacency for Wonders. Mayan Unique Science Building. Ageless.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mayans have one very strong district attribute going for them. Their Unique Quarter, Uwaybil K’uh, means throughout the rest of the game, every time you research a Technology, the Settlement gains a nice chunk of Production. The fact that this district is percentage-based means this scales exceptionally well through Ages. This is strong enough on its own that you may want to consider choosing Maya, even if the rest of its traits aren’t the best on offer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vegetation is not the hardest of the terrains to get access to, but the buffs you get for being on those tiles are relatively middling. Of course, if you start in a heavily vegetated position, you can get some nice benefits, but even then the rewards for meeting those conditions are unlikely to be game-changing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">0.5% Science for the Palace being adjacent to Vegetated Terrain is nice, but likely won’t decide your Age. The Hul’che are a great in these cases too, as enemies will have to fight through vegetation to get at you with their armies, allowing you to hit them ranged from safety. That said, if they are not in Vegetation, than they might as well not be Unique units - and other civilization’s units will more likely run you over if so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The K’uh Nah is a really nice boost to Science that is definitely a great option for the Scientific minded, so there is certainly value here. If you find yourself in dense vegetation, the Mayans can certainly do well for themselves, and offer awesome benefits later in a game. However, they are a little dependent on other factors, and are better for banking on your future. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">C-Tier Antiquity Civs</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/civ-7-khmer-1739988168962.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>C - Khmer</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Ksekam Chamnon</strong> - Districts on Rivers do not remove the natural yield of the tile. +30% Production towards constructing Angkor Wat.</li><li><strong>Yuthahathi</strong> - Khmer Unique Cavalry Unit. Higher Combat Strength, but slower Movement. Immune to flood damage. Ignores Zone of Control.</li><li><strong>Vaishya</strong> - Khmer Unique Merchant. Civilian who can establish a Trade Route to import Resources from a foreign Settlement. Immune to flood damage. Ignores movement penalties from Wet Terrain.</li><li><strong>Baray</strong> - +3 Food. +1 Food on all Floodplains in this Settlement. Khmer Unique Improvement. Ageless. Does not remove Warehouse bonuses on a tile. Must be placed on Flat Terrain. One per Settlement.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Khmer definitely have benefits, and could be very strong in the right circumstances. However, they are strong when there are a lot of floods, and though they are relatively common in the Antiquity Age, this means they're still a little situational. Retaining the natural yield on Districts placed on the River isnice to have, but not a universally powerful effect. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Yuthahathi is definitely a very interesting unit too, as it is one of the most powerful units in combat in the Age, however, they are slow and lose a lot of ground to Cavalry other Civilizations may be running. The unit is best used as battering rams against armies and Settlements, but if they are smart, your rivals should be able to deal with them by keeping their own Cavalry out of range. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Baray is a nice Unique Building too that really helps boost Food which is certainly powerful in the opening portions of a game. However, you need to be on floodplains for it to become supercharged, which is situational. Again, the Khmer have their place and even have very high potential, but if you spawn on a map and don't have the correct terrain, you may struggle against Civilizations with more reliable abilities. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Patrick is a freelance journalist with over 13 years of experience who loves going deep on games and getting into their systems.

We talk about those. We talk about when they're talking about what the story might be, we say, ‘Well, maybe you want to go this way because we're planning on maybe doing something with this character and so forth and so on,’ and help to deal with that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But it's been great, and we've enjoyed it enormously,” Safran said. “Everything had been so siloed, and now that's completely broken down, and it's been great. Because it also applies to consumer products and experiences and everything that DC touches runs up through us now, which is awesome.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for when the first game in the DCU will be revealed, Gunn said “a couple of years.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, it's a couple years, but we've had some pretty active involvement in some stuff coming up,” Safran continued. “It's really interesting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. Games has had an extremely difficult 12 months, first with the catastrophic release of Rocksteady’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</u></a>, then the disappointing release of Smash Bros.-style brawler <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/multiversus"><u>MultiVersus</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros.

Warner Bros. Games' only other recent release was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions"><u>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</u></a>, which failed to make an impression.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking in a financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav said: "We recognise [the games business] is substantially underperforming its potential right now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-officially-ends-after-final-update-offline-mode-and-true-ending"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League post-launch content has come to an end</u></a> with the delivery of its year one roadmap, and Warner Bros. has announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-dev-calls-out-threats-to-harm-following-shutdown-announcement-i-am-in-deep-mourning-for-the-game"><u>the impending closure of MultiVersus</u></a>.

The developers behind Skyblivion are also working on overhauling various areas of the original Elder Scrolls title. The work ranges from ensuring "unique items are actually unique" to helping existing bosses in Oblivion live up to their reputation a bit more, noting Mannimarco as one in particular.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/25/monster-hunter-world-review">Monster Hunter: World</a> blew the doors of the series wide open for a huge new audience in 2018 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-rise-review">Monster Hunter Rise</a> gave us high-flying Wirebugs to more quickly zip around in 2021, it makes a lot of sense that Capcom would do whatever it can to welcome that newfound following into the next frontier. That’s exactly what Monster Hunter Wilds does, smoothing out the already excellent process of turning big scary dragons into silly little hats to be faster, more flexible, and less fiddly than ever before. The other side of those Dual Blades, however, is that Wilds is light on any real challenge, even for what I’d expect at launch, never asking me to think hard about my equipment. But while the monsters may not pose much of a threat this time around, smart tweaks to combat still mean the act of carving them up has rarely felt better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A clear example of how Capcom has tried to better welcome new players is that the campaign in Wilds isn’t just a totally forgettable excuse to kill anything that crosses your path this time. Okay, it’s still <em>mostly</em> that, in that you and the Hunter’s Guild set out to explore yet another “uncharted” land in order to solve some environmental mystery – but while the story itself isn’t particularly fresh, the difference here is that the characters within it are actually pretty great. Whether it’s the excitable engineer Gemma, your empathetic handler Alma, or the total space cadet of a biologist Erik, your team is full of likeable personalities and little character arcs throughout the gorgeously animated cutscenes. That was enough to get me more invested in Wilds’ campaign than I’ve been in any previous Monster Hunter.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Monster Hunter Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The revamped structure of Wilds also means that campaign is significantly shorter than I was expecting. I reached the credits in just 15 hours and didn’t need to go back and fight a single monster twice in that time, getting enough materials from any initial encounters to keep my gear up to snuff and jump right from one mission to the next. When you compare that to the 40+ hours it took to see the end of the story in World, it’s clear that the intent is to allow more people to feel like they “beat” Wilds, and I can certainly appreciate how that shift toward approachability might appeal to folk who have otherwise been intimidated by the series. But as a veteran, I can’t help but be a little disappointed that I literally didn’t get knocked out once in that entire time, and I never hit a skill- or armor-testing wall of a monster who forced me to really think about my equipment more deeply in order to earn the reward of a hard-fought victory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Avoiding spoilers, there is more to do once you do get past the credits, of course. That’s where the larger changes Wilds makes to the traditional Monster Hunter loop really start to shine. Gone are the days of returning to a separate town between every hunt, then going down the same checklist of tasks before you’re ready for the next one. Pretty much everything you need is out in the field with you and every location is seamlessly connected to the others, from a flaming oil-filled basin to a frigid mountain top, meaning you’re never more than a lickety-split loading screen away from wherever you want to be. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Gone are the days of returning to town between every single hunt.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Systems like cooking that let you prepare yourself for the ensuing hunt are still here, but now those food buffs last a set time after eating and don’t go away until the timer runs out – it doesn’t even tick down while in camp, making a previously repetitive process substantially smoother without removing the depth it added to hunts. Convenient adjustments like this are all over the place in Wilds, and the roaringly successful result is that a vast majority of the friction past games could produce as you start and stop and restart between every encounter has been removed. Now you can just check your map for monster information, jump on your mount, and <em>hunt</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those untamed expanses can be truly stunning, too. Each area will shift between three weather states with unique conditions depending on where you are. For example, the initial desert landscape starts dusty and washed out before turning into a full-on sandstorm with explosive lightning strikes and then finally giving way to a lush and vibrant period of plenty, while the forest follows a similar pattern but with torrential rain instead. These miniature seasons aren’t terribly impactful to your hunts in practice, but they can affect which monsters will appear, and it’s a true delight to see each hunting ground look dramatically different depending on when you are there. The only exceptions to this are a couple late-game areas that suffered from extremely distracting texture pop-in issues while I was playing on the PS5 Pro’s Balanced option, though things ran great apart from that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The monsters you face on your expeditions are also generally excellent, whether that’s a returning banger like Gore Magala or a flashy newcomer like the flamenco-inspired spider Lala Barina. And while the headliner, Arkveld, is one of my favorites of the bunch thanks to its chain-like appendages, the true stunner has to be Nu Udra: The tentacles of Monster Hunter’s first octopus-like creature can be as unpredictable to contend with as you might expect (especially when they are literally on fire), but the satisfaction of severing every single one over the course of a hunt is second to none. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The feel of fighting any of these monsters is also in a great spot for Wilds. The appeal of Monster Hunter’s fights has always been how it empowers you with flashy moves and hard-hitting attacks, but knowing <em>when</em> to strike and where to stand and how the monster will behave next is just as important as figuring out which buttons to press. These are hulking behemoths with varied and exciting moves of their own, and to some degree you really do have to be a hunter, not just an action hero, to take them down efficiently by learning their ins and outs. That’s true in Wilds too, but combat is also more flexible and forgiving, letting you adjust your footing a little more mid-combo, resulting in fewer moments where a mistimed attack with a long animation had me embarrassingly slicing at the air without losing the careful consideration these chunky strikes require.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Wilds never challenged me with any real threats, even in the endgame.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That philosophy is complemented by the new Focus Mode that makes it a little easier to hone in on specific parts of a monster, and if you put enough punishment on a given limb (or head or flank) it’ll open up a Wound there. In many ways, the combat in Wilds feels like it’s all about Wounds, as they are essentially a resource that is earned and consumed across every fight. You’ll deal more damage to Wounds, but deal enough and they “break,” resetting that spot. Every weapon also has a simple-to-execute Focus Strike that will deal a burst of damage to a Wound and break it right away, so maximizing the amount of time you leave one open and then using that finisher before it closes naturally is an interesting sub-game to manage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or, at least, it<em> would</em> be if Wilds ever presented me with a challenge that really asked me to make those considerations. Whether I was playing online with others, solo with the new AI Support Hunters at my side (which are a welcome and surprisingly competent addition), or alone with just my Palico helper, I never had a single mission reach the 20-minute mark, and I have only fainted two times <em>total</em> across dozens of hours<em>. </em>Compare that to something like Kirin in World, which smacked me silly my first couple of attempts and forced me to regroup and craft an armor set around thunder resistance, and it’s hard not to feel like Capcom’s desire to make Wilds a more inviting Monster Hunter sanded off some of the bumps I actually enjoyed in terms of overcoming real threats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things do ramp up a little bit in the post-game, but even there I’ve only really had to worry about upgrading my armor or falling behind in damage once or twice during the content that’s available at launch – and that includes against the tougher Tempered versions of monsters. After the 15 hours it took to beat the campaign, I only had to spend another 15 to finish every side quest (that wasn’t about catching fish), and just five more after that before I had the best armor set and weapon I wanted and a pretty solid suite of skill-boosting Decorations. To be fair, I still have plenty more equipment I <em>could</em> grind for, but my usual desire to get the top-tier weapon of each element type and put together specialized outfits for certain challenging fights just isn’t here this time – because those fights aren’t here to drive it. If I could already kill what is currently the hardest monster in Wilds quickly and without issue the very first time I encountered it, what am I supposed to be grinding for except the sake of it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think a lot of this comes down to raw numbers that could hypothetically be tweaked in one of the many patches to come, but some of what makes things easier seems baked into the bones of Wilds. For example, nearly every time you Focus Strike a Wound, the monster gets locked into a short-but-substantial-enough stagger animation that provides a moment of advantage, and you’ll be breaking Wounds <em>a lot,</em> so those add up. Meanwhile, on the crafting side of things, my hunt for the best armor was way shorter than I ever expected because materials that are usually super rare can sometimes show up as guaranteed rewards when looking at the monster list on your map – and that version of that hunt can even then be saved and repeated up to three more times, letting you farm what is supposed to be the hardest-to-find item like it was a simple hide. That is excitingly convenient, but it’s also what brought that loot chase to an almost trivially fast end.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The easier tuning will probably get more people through the door.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I imagine this difficulty tuning will get a lot more people through the front door, but it also means that where my past three Monster Hunter reviews wrapped up around the 50- to 60-hour mark while I still had plenty more I was excited to do, I started losing steam with Wilds before I even hit 40. (Even my time reviewing of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wild-hearts-review">Wilds Hearts</a> lasted longer than this.) Although, don’t get me wrong: there's still a healthy chunk of game here by almost any standard, and it has absolutely been some of the most fun I’ve had with the series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also sure longtime fans will be reading this going, “Well, we just have to wait for updates/G-Rank/etc. for the real challenge.” But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-its-first-free-title-update-this-spring-adding-mizutsune">Capcom’s own update roadmap</a> has left me wary of how long that might take: There’s only <em>one</em> new monster announced for all of Spring, and then only one currently listed for Summer after that. In contrast, Rise also felt slight at launch, but got six new monsters just one month later, and then three more a month after that. Wilds already feels like it needs endgame threats like Monster Hunter's formidable Elder Dragons to really push its limits, and if instead it only ends up getting one returning monster in the first three-ish months after launch, this could be an impatient wait for its inevitable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/04/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-review">Iceborne-</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-review">Sunbreak</a>-style expansion.</p><div id="the-10-best-monster-hunter-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">The 10 Best Monster Hunter Games</h3><h3>The 10 Best Monster Hunter Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That all said, Wilds deserves credit for being one of the most customizable games I have played – not just in the Monster Hunter series, but anywhere. You can swap between two weapons on the fly while hunting, there’s a huge host of accessibility features, you can adjust the size of or turn off individual elements on your UI, you have more control than ever over your menus and radial wheels, and you can alter the look of minutiae like your mount, chat stickers, and even fast-travel tents to a surprising degree. As a crowning touch, you can finally wear any version of each armor set, essentially doubling the cosmetic options previously available as you get into the all-important fashion side of things toward the end. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Partying up online has also been made more robust, letting you run around each map with your friends (including through cross-play) and seamlessly flow from hunt to hunt, still getting full mission rewards without having to regroup at camp between each fight. And even if you’re largely planning to play solo, there are quality-of-life changes here for you, too – that could be the previously mentioned Support Hunters that fill empty spots in your party when you fire an SOS Flare (before being replaced by any real people who eventually answer the call), but also the inclusion of an “Online Single-Player” option that lets you fire Flares to get help but still pause the action entirely before you do. (That’s a trick we can hope FromSoftware learns for the next Souls game.)</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
