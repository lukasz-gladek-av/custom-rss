Of course, OpenAI boss Sam Altman has allowed for his likeness to be used ‚Äî so here he is having a lightsaber battle with Pikachu:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Pokemon don't sue me ü•≤ Sora 2 is insane <a href="https://t.co/dInl6EysJl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/dInl6EysJl</a></p>‚Äî Pm Prod (@PMProdResearch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PMProdResearch/status/1973542955832185143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Pok√©mon, Nintendo's own Mario characters have been getting plenty of use.

"In short, we don't have a definitive answer yet," business lawyer and creator of the Virtual Legality podcast Richard Hoeg told IGN today. "There are indications in some quarters that training on protected materials is likely going to be deemed legal so long as the materials themselves were acquired for some lawful purpose (and not pirated). But on the output side, the Disney/Dreamworks lawsuit makes some good arguments for why/how the law should expect these platforms to police prompts for infringing requests, especially if they are already policing for something else (porn, bigotry, etc.). But all of those are still just arguments, not settled law..</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hoeg continued: "The law moves slowly, far slower than technology, which is why you see these tech companies racing ahead of it a bit. My best guess is that OpenAI is probably going to be okay long term on the training sets they used (assuming they weren't pirated), and that the 'opt out of training' option therefore won't do much of anything. Where they really need to concern themselves is on the output side and/or if they are marketing their software's abilities with protected content themselves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company for comment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, the famously litigious The Pok√©mon Company formally responded to the use of Pok√©mon TV hero Ash Ketchum and the series' theme tune by the Department of Homeland Security, as part of a video showing people being arrested and handcuffed by law enforcement agents. "Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content," a spokesperson told IGN, "and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while The Pok√©mon Company may not begin legal action over that usage, the firm is still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-mods-dont-count-as-prior-art-as-theyre-not-full-games-attempting-to-sway-judge-in-palworld-lawsuit">keenly battling on against Palworld developer Pocketpair</a> in its claim that the game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rewrites-patent-mid-case-in-ongoing-lawsuit-against-palworld-dev-pocketpair-but-why">infringed upon multiple patents</a>. Earlier this week, former Capcom designer Yoshiki Okamoto sparked a backlash in Japan after suggesting that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-capcom-designer-yoshiki-okamoto-sparks-backlash-in-japan-by-saying-palworld-has-crossed-a-line-that-should-not-be-crossed">Pok√©mon and Nintendo's legal action against Palworld was justified</a>, since Pocketpair's game had "crossed a line that should not be crossed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
