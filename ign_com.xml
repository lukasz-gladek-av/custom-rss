            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fresh-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-2-details-confirmed-alongside-new-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision has released a new trailer for Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Season 2, which kicks off later this month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 2 goes live on January 28 and adds five Multiplayer maps — Bounty, Dealership, Lifeline, Bullet (Mid-Season), Grind (Mid-Season) — and sees the return of the fan-favorite Gun Game mode, and adds new weapons and operators.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer offers a look at Bounty, Dealership, and Lifeline, the latter of which looks like a small version of the much-loved Hijacked MP map from Black Ops 2. Dealership looks like it's set in a car dealership. It's hard to make out the setting for Bounty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In keeping with an apparent ninja theme, the trailer confirms the addition of swords via an operator dual wielding katanas. Developer Treyarch had already teased the addition of an “iconic” SMG with Season 2, and it’s rumored to be the PPSH-41 from Call of Duty: Vanguard​​​​​​.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Zombies, the trailer shows a first look at gameplay of the new map, The Tomb, as well as an ice staff. Warzone does not appear to be represented in the video. Activision is expected to publish a Season 2 roadmap shortly.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans eagerly awaiting the launch of Season 2 not just for new content, but for promised improved anti-cheat tech.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision has confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-will-let-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-ranked-console-players-disable-crossplay-with-pc-as-cheating-complaints-ramp-up">it plans to let console Ranked players disable crossplay with PC players for the launch of Season 2</a>, with more improvements coming in subsequent seasons after a backlash over cheating across Black Ops 6 Multiplayer and in the battle royale, Warzone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Warzone, Activision has said Season 2 will have less content than originally planned as it addresses some of the more severe issues currently afflicting the game. It will focus on gameplay tuning, bug fixes, and quality-of-life improvements with the coming season, pushing back new content originally planned for the launch of Season 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-launches-account-system-with-benefits-and-rewards-opens-with-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has launched its own account system akin to the Nintendo Account or Ubisoft Connect that will "maximize" its online services and offer various benefits, kicking off with a free costume for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The aptly named Sega Account was revealed on its new <a href="https://sega-account.com/auth/content/notice/01JJ1QNG67ZW54BR35EAZRAJ7Y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> and is described as "an online profile that gives you access to a host of benefits when playing Sega and Atlus titles and using their online services.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"By creating a Sega Account, you'll receive the latest news about Sega and Atlus games, events, and promotions. Additionally, your Sega Account grants you access to exclusive bonuses and the ability to link accounts on various gaming platforms."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first of these benefits is the Kazuma Kiryu Special Outfit in Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, which lets protagonist Goro Majima dress up as his friend, rival, and longtime Yakuza series lead. This is the same outfit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-players-can-dress-up-majima-as-kiryu-if-they-sign-up-for-email-notifications">Sega is giving away for signing up to email notifications</a>, but it's unclear if that has now changed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those with a Sega Account between January 22 and March 7 will receive the outfit, distributed via a code between February 17 and March 7. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-release-date-brought-forward-a-week-to-avoid-monster-hunter-wilds-clash">Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii itself arrives on February 21</a>, brought forward from its original February 28 date to avoid a clash with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega didn't announce what future benefits fans could expect, but it will presumably include its other flagship franchises such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Persona. It could also tie into a Game Pass style subscription service Sega is currently considering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported by the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgnj7e8028o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>, the company is currently "evaluating some opportunities" in the subscription service space and, just like PlayStation launched its Game Pass rival on the back of its established PlayStation Plus service, Sega could be setting the foundations for a similar move in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are also speculating a connection with the impending Sega "Super Game," expected to release by the end of March 2026. While practically nothing is known about this project, Sega described it as a "large scale global title" that many fans are expecting to be an accumulation of various games akin to what Call of Duty has done with its titles or what Ubisoft is working on with Assassin's Creed Infinity: essentially a hub for myriad other games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon had teased fans over the years by referencing a pink ninja called Floyd, and, back in 2023, <a href="https://x.com/thethiny/status/1706734341982687374" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mortal Kombat dataminer TheThiny</u></a> unearthed text in the Mortal Kombat 1 files that referenced a character of the same name. Only now though, years later, is Floyd actually in Mortal Kombat 1, although the specifics are hazy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for Mortal Kombat 1’s secret Floyd fight follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/thethiny/status/1881959728756191322" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheThiny has revealed the secret Floyd fight</a>, which is preceded by a cool cutscene in which ninjas of various colors appear in beams of light before settling on our pink friend. You then get the unique “YOU FOUND FLOYD” text flash on-screen. The idea, it appears, is that Floyd is all Mortal Kombat’s ninjas in one, a bit like Chameleon from Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/22/screenshot-2025-01-22-120049-1737547291558.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Floyd is now in Mortal Kombat 1. Image credit: <a href="https://x.com/thethiny/status/1881959728756191322">TheThiny</a>.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But how do you actually trigger the fight? It’s unclear at the moment. TheThiny said the fight was discovered after a player completed “a bunch of Floyd challenges then he appears. This video was taken in the Towers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How many challenges must be completed? We’re not sure, but it’s a lot. Could it be that each challenge completion increases the chance Floyd will turn up? We’re not sure, but maybe?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are still working out Floyd’s moveset, which appears to combine attacks and abilities from various characters on the roster. Floyd isn’t officially playable, but that hasn’t stopped dataminers from getting hands-on with the character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s super cool is that beating Floyd in this secret fight unlocks a brand new stage, the beautiful Field, which players have already noticed is from the Mortal Kombat 1 announcement trailer.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">New Stage:<br>Field<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MK1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MK1</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MortalKombat1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MortalKombat1</a> <a href="https://t.co/ygkarWNRhU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ygkarWNRhU</a></p>— thethiny 🐰🍉 (@thethiny) <a href="https://twitter.com/thethiny/status/1881782846047899712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">So, Floyd is in Mortal Kombat 1, which means Ed Boon has finally made good on his desire to add the character.
