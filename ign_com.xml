Meanwhile, Ratau—still firm in his faith in the Red Crown—tries to protect and guide Lamb’s remaining followers and undermine the blasphemy of the rival camp. As The One Who Waits prepares their return, great sacrifices must be weighed for the future of the Cult of the Lamb.</em></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/image-1765999564724.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Oni Press/Devolver Digital/Massive Monster</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cult of the Lamb: Last Sacrament Special #1 will be released on March 4, 2026.
