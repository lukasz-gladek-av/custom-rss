While sometimes players can keep playing on discontinued software for a limited time, in this instance it appears the PS4 game will stop responding completely on the deadline.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"From that point on you'll need to play [on current gen systems] to keep enjoying the game.

As a result, it refines a lot of pain points from recent years, like AI defender positioning, improved goalkeepers, and more responsive dribbling. It's already seen some sizeable patches to adjust gameplay based on continued feedback, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can pick between Competitive preset, which features similar gameplay to what’s come before, or a more realistic-feeling Authentic option that’s closer to the real game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Game is amazing. I just like to be different."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Omelet You Cook, a roguelike cooking game on Steam, has been having a great early access it seems. It recently passed 500 player reviews, and every last one of them was positive, making it one of a rare few games on Steam to have 100% positive reviews.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As pointed out to us by developer Dan Schumacher of SchuBox Games, the game received its first negative review today. And sure, negative reviews are just part of the deal when releasing a game on Steam. But what really bothered Schumacher is that according to the text of the review, the reviewer didn't actually dislike the game. They played for 0.8 hours total, 0.2 hours when they posted the review, and wrote the following:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Game is amazing. I just like to be different."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN reached out to the reviewer for further comment ahead of this piece but didn't hear back.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The community appears to have sprung to Omelet You Cook's defense, as the game has received almost 40 new positive reviews in the 14 hours since the negative review was posted, and a number of people have commented scolding the negative reviewer for ruining the positive streak just for kicks, though some of those comments are unfortunately far harsher than the negative review itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Seeing this review was very draining for us," said Schumacher to IGN. "We knew 100% wouldn't last forever but it hurt to have the streak ended by someone who in their own words thinks the game is amazing. Emotionally I think I'd feel better if it was someone complaining about bugs, or design choices, or just feeling the game isn't for them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A single negative review is hardly the end of the world for SchuBox Games, but it does make a difference. There are very, very, <em>very</em> few games on Steam with perfectly positive reviews, or at least in meaningful amounts like this. The more you get, the more likely it is someone will have something bad to say. There's a game called Shooters, Ready! on Steam that's only available in Japanese and similarly has over 500 positive reviews and 0 negative ones. But at least using the built in search by user reviews, there don't seem to be any others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Schumacher, having no negative reviews actually did afford him some benefits, too:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Having 100% positive reviews was a huge benefit for us because it's extremely abnormal for a game with hundreds of reviews," he told IGN. "People see 100% and become curious enough to read through some of the reviews to understand why it's so beloved or to check out the demo for themselves. We've had multiple people join our Discord or leave their own review and mention that they gave the game a chance because they couldn't believe it was maintaining 100% for so long.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Omelet You Cook Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"...The biggest impact this will have on Omelet You Cook is losing that mystique of a perfect 100%. That led to some opportunities for Omelet You Cook to be mentioned because it was atypical. But honestly for players coming across the Steam page, I don't think 99% vs 100% makes any difference at all. Some users like to filter by negative reviews to understand where the pain points are and I have to appreciate that this negative review frames Omelet You Cook in a very positive light."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's long been known that engagement with games on Steam in the form of Wishlists and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-developers-think-of-steam-reviews" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviews</a> can be a massive boon, especially for small developers. There are simply too many games, and getting attention on such a crowded storefront is impossible if you don't already have a built-up audience or a lot of advertising money. Having lots of positive reviews and few negative ones gets games like Omelet You Cook visibility when searching under certain filters or ranking systems, <a href="https://steam250.com/hidden_gems" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including third-party ones</a>. That's certainly been the case for Omelet You Cook</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're very fortunate and grateful to have reached 507 positive reviews before our first negative," Schumacher said. "We worked incredibly hard to achieve that with 15 content updates over 5 months. But we also got incredibly lucky and it's nowhere near a flawless game. There's plenty of valid reasons somebody might have a negative experience with the game and we're grateful to all 507 chefs who took the time to write a positive review. Each one helps Omelet You Cook reach a wider audience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?
