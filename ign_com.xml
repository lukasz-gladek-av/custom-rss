            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gives-away-its-most-mysterious-card-to-all-players-today<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Trading Card Pocket has finally revealed its most mysterious card by giving it away to all players for free today, January 20.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An alternate art version of the Pokédex is now available as a reward for the worldwide player base of Pokémon TCG Pocket collecting a total of 40 billion cards. This Pokédex is Promo A card 008, which was blank until today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To celebrate achieving 40 billion cards acquired in total by players around the world, we are giving you a promo card," developer Creatures Inc. said. The Pokédex card is available until April 30, 2025, after which point it will seemingly become unobtainable for good.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/20/img-5531-1737376012565.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have long wondered how the Pokédex card would be made available, as the other Promo A cards from 001 to 009 were all available upon Pokémon TCG Pocket's launch. Creatures Inc. has since released every other Promo A card up to number 033, leaving the 008 slot strangely blank until now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This release also confirms the Pokédex is not connected to the Advance Ticket item hiding in players' inventories. "This ticket cannot be used yet," reads the description of the item, also available since launch. "Wait and see what it's for!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though one Pokémon TCG Pocket mystery has today been solved, fans will just have to be patient before this other one is detailed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived in October and follows the standard mobile and free-to-play game model, flooding players with rewards in the first few days before soon drying up, with spending real-world money the only real way to re-experience that early thrill <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-reveals-mew-led-set-coming-next-week-and-60-million-download-milestone">outside of the occasional set drop like Mythical Island</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing Genetic Apex, the first set of cards which totals 226 officially but also contains 60 rare alternate art cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take players not spending money around two years according to one estimate</a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-player-reveals-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-complete-the-first-set-after-spending-1500">those looking to make it rain can wrap up the collection after dropping around $1,500</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans' complaints over this high cost were exacerbated when Creatures Inc. outlined its highly anticipated trading feature too, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-trading-unveiled-but-is-so-poorly-received-the-developers-had-to-respond">which caused such an uproar that it had to release a follow-up response</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-insists-the-game-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-as-fans-obsess-over-a-picture-of-chocolate-cake<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight fans have been through the wringer recently, with cryptic X/Twitter activity from one developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake">sparking rampant speculation that the hotly anticipated follow-up Hollow Knight: Silksong will finally re-emerge at Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct in April</a> — and potentially even release on Nintendo’s next-gen console as a timed launch exclusive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all started when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i31gas/what_we_know_so_far_about_the_william_pellen/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>supersleuths on the Hollow Knight subreddit</u></a> noticed that on January 15, co-director of Team Cherry William Pellen had changed his Twitter/X profile picture to a picture of a chocolate cake. Alongside this, Pellen tweeted: “something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Nintendo’s Switch 2 reveal was rumored for January 16, and so it proved — that was the day <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name"><u>Nintendo finally announced the Switch 2</u></a>. Had Pellen really asked followers to keep an eye out for the Switch 2 reveal? If so, why?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans then reverse-searched the picture of the cake, leading them to a recipe for Brooklyn Blackout Cake on cooking website <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/blackout-cake" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bon Appétit</u></a>. The date the recipe was published: April 2, 2024. The date of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct is April 2, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans also wondered what Pellen’s new X/Twitter handle, @everydruidwaswr, meant, if anything. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i36zi6/comment/m7l3uqu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Redditor Representative-True speculated</u></a> that the “wr” in “everydruidwaswr” was the start of a word, perhaps “wrong,” or perhaps stands for “was wrong,” and pointed to the Druid of the Moss Temple Silksong NPC as evidence of… something.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pellen had a new X/Twitter name to go along with the new handle and profile picture: “little bomey.” Fans noticed Little Boomey is a wine from Southern Australia, where Team Cherry is based, but the spelling is different. The upshot of all this was that some fans thought Pellen had kicked off a Silksong alternate reality game (ARG), but over the weekend comments appeared to pour cold water on this theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, Hollow Knight YouTuber fireb0rn <a href="https://x.com/fireb0rn/status/1880411907552911626" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to say Team Cherry marketing and publishing chief Matthew 'Leth' Griffin had got in touch “to confirm there was no Silksong ARG and that the changes to William's account and the tweet were a nothingburger. Apologies to have misled everyone. The cake was a lie."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/283467363729408000/586931790208434203/1330100156518891571" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on the Hollow Knight Discord</a>, Griffin backed this up, saying: "It wasn’t [an ARG]. But it was still some impressive sleuthing skills by the fans... like ya’ll are WAY beyond those 2020 riddles now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Griffin himself followed up to respond to one fan who wondered if Team Cherry had given up on Hollow Knight: Silksong. “Yes the game is real, progressing and will release,” <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Griffin tweeted</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This has done little to calm all the speculation, as you can perhaps imagine. And at the time of this article’s publication, Pellen’s tweet remains online. Pellen himself has yet to explain whatever his X/Twitter activity is all about, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembering that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-sequel-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch"><u>when Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced</u></a>, Team Cherry confirmed the launch platforms as Windows, Mac, Linux, and Nintendo Switch. But that was six years ago. We have a few months to find out what this all means, but in the meantime, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-heres-everything-announced-and-confirmed"><u>everything announced at Nintendo's Switch 2 reveal</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
