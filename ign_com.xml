It launched to critical acclaim, with IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">Astro Bot review</a> returning a 9/10. We said: “A fantastically inventive platformer in its own right, Astro Bot is particularly special for anyone with a place in their heart for PlayStation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Astro Bot’s sales aren’t up there with some of Sony’s big hitters (Helldivers 2 remains the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with an incredible 12 million sold in 12 weeks), it compares favorably to other recently released family friendly platforms. In Europe, launch sales of Astro Bot were 34% higher than those of 2022’s Sonic Frontiers and 52% bigger than those of 2020’s Crash Bandicoot 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To put Astro Bot’s sales success into more recent context, Sega’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sells-1-million-units-on-launch-day-sega-reveals">Sonic x Shadow Generations hit the one million sold mark on its launch day of October 25</a>, according to Sega. But that game launched across multiple platforms and generations, whereas Astro Bot is a PS5 exclusive. Astro Bot sales will surely continue to grow as we head into the crucial holiday shopping season and gamers look to buy a PS5 or the recently released PS5 Pro.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">All 173 PlayStation Characters in Astro Bot - Easter Eggs</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Asobi has continued to support the game since launch with a number of updates that have added speedrun challenge levels and new cameos to rescue. At launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot"><u>Astro Bot</u></a> featured 173 bot cameos from PlayStation games past and present (check out IGN’s feature, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-every-playstation-character-easter-eggs"><u>Astro Bot: Every PlayStation Character - Easter Eggs</u></a>, for more).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-dev-says-we-really-respect-the-choice-of-each-publisher-amid-final-fantasy-cameo-absence">iconic Final Fantasy characters were conspicuous by their absence</a> — an omission fans were quick to pick up on in the context of Final Fantasy's long-standing association with PlayStation. That means no Cloud from Final Fantasy 7, or any other character from the famous role-playing franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/empire-of-the-ants-multiplayer-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Empire of the Ants is striking to look at. For a moment, you might even believe it’s real macro-lens footage of ants in a nature documentary, and the level of detail on the textures of the forest floor is extremely impressive. It’s not really what it appears to be, though: this may be a real-time strategy game with swarms of insects on screen at once, but you’re never actually commanding more than seven units – and given the somewhat clumsy way its controls make you cycle through them to give orders, that’s a mercy. You may be capturing and building up nests, but there’s literally nothing beneath the surface. So while it appears vast, Empire of the Ants is actually a pretty small-scale strategy game in most other ways, and the lack of unit variety and multiplayer modes make it feel smaller still.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Multiplayer matches have a fair amount of nuance in how you use your small number of units and build out your nests to tech up, and there’s ample room for skilled players to turn a situation to their advantage with smart use of powers to boost their bugs’ damage output and debuff the enemy. It’s not unlike a slimmed-down version of Company of Heroes in the way you capture territory and generate the two resources – food and wood – and that’s a good starting point. Ant units get locked into melee combat and can’t disengage until one or the other loses, so you can learn to hold off a dangerous Warrior unit until reinforcements arrive or prevent a retreat while you finish off an enemy. And while you can quickly rebuild a lost unit if you have the food available, each ant legion has a home nest they’ll respawn from, which can mean there’s a long hike back to the front lines.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each nest you capture has a set number of upgrade slots that can be filled by a building or spent to support a unit from that nest, so turtling up isn’t really an option – you won’t even have enough slots to tech up to tier 3, which means you’ll inevitably be overrun by ants with better stats. All the building is done from a radial menu that pops up when you interact with a nest and, cleverly, you use your ant as a cursor to select things. Crucially, taking out an enemy’s nest disables all the upgrades that were based there, up to and including turning off their minimap. (Fog of war is a thing on the minimap, but because you’re viewing the world in third person instead of a traditional RTS overhead view, it’s handy that you can spot a moving legion of ants from a long distance even if their icon hasn’t shown up on the map.)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s fundamentally only one faction to work with.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Empire of the Ants feels thin relative to most real-time strategy games, in large part because there’s fundamentally only one faction to work with. Everyone always has the same set of workers, big-headed warriors, and “gunner” ants as their primary units, and they all counter each other in a straightforward rock-paper-scissors balance. (You can’t even play as the visually different termites you fight against in the campaign.) The only variety comes from the ability to customize your loadout by choosing four of eight available powers for your main ant to cast, swapping out your support unit between healing aphids, armoring snails, or troop-carrying beetles, as well as one of three “super predator” unit types. Those certainly enable different strategies, but I’m not a fan of the way locking those choices in before a match begins limits your ability to pivot to a different approach if your opponent throws you a curveball. I’d rather be able to switch from the flying wasps to the acid-resistant beetles as my choice of predator if my enemy goes heavy on gunner units, for instance, but that’s not an option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another major weakness of multiplayer is that there are only two modes: 1v1 or 1v1v1. That means there’s no option to play cooperatively against the AI (which is very weak even on the highest difficulties and doesn’t seem to know how to use powers, which are crucial) with a friend. It does have 21 maps, at least, and there’s a fair amount of diversity there in terms of how they’re laid out and the creeps that guard their resource caches, like huge spiders and praying mantises that are cool to watch your ants take down. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s good, because it soon becomes clear that there’s basically no variety to the bugs’ animations. At first, skittering around at high speeds can be entertaining, even when the controls freak out because you accidentally climb a small branch and start spinning around it like an actual confused ant. Watching a swarm flow over terrain is convincing and, since we’re up so close, dramatic. Warriors will pick up enemies in their big jaws and shake them around, and dead bodies are flung high in the air like mortarboards at a high school graduation ceremony (which I don’t think ants actually do?) and then roll down hills. But when you’ve seen one ant-vs-ant fight, you’ve seen them all. Beetles in particular get repetitive to watch very quickly because of their lunging attacks. Even so, there are good reasons to play the Empire of the Ants’s multiplayer, which cannot be said for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/empire-of-the-ants-single-player-campaign-review">single-player campaign</a>.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Empire of the Ants’s multiplayer modes have some clever ideas for how insects do battle, having you scurry around as a commander giving orders and casting buffs on your legions of bugs. Managing its deceptively small-scale battles presents some interesting challenges, and the impressive, hyper-realistic graphics are let down only by animations that grow repetitive after a few matches. What undermines it most is the lack of unit variety and multiplayer modes, which don’t include multiple bug factions or any options to play as a team or against a competent AI. Without that, it’s hard to see this game having a lot of legs.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 data-cy="object-review-title">Empire of the Ants Review</h3><div data-cy="review-content"><p>okay</p><p>It's gorgeous to look at and has some depth to its tiny battles, but a lack of modes and unit variety means Empire of the Ants's multiplayer isn't likely to have a lot of legs.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
