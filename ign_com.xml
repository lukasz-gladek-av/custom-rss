            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> team at EA and Battlefield Studios is shrinking ticket sizes for their large-scale Conquest multiplayer game mode, but players aren’t sold that these changes will improve the pace of matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An update to the structure of Conquest matches arrived in <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978462075488817479" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an official post</a> from the Battlefield Comms X/Twitter account. It details blanket changes across every Conquest map in Battlefield 6, as the developers aim to ensure matches “finish at a more natural pace.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To achieve this, BF Studios says it has reduced ticket sizes – which essentially represent each team's available reinforcements – from 1000 tickets to a unique ticket goal for each map. These range from 900 tickets on maps like Siege of Cairo and Empire State to 700 tickets on maps like Mirak Valley and Operation Firestorm. You can see the full breakdown below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New Conquest Ticket Sizes in Battlefield 6</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Siege of Cairo from 1000 to 900</li><li>Empire State from 1000 to 900</li><li>Iberian Offensive from 1000 to 900</li><li>Liberation Peak From 1000 to 800</li><li>Manhattan Bridge From 1000 to 800</li><li>Operation Firestorm From 1000 to 700</li><li>New Sobek City from 1000 to 900</li><li>Mirak Valley from 1000 to 700</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">"Previously, many rounds were hitting the time limit instead of ending when one team ran out of tickets," the post explains. "We'll keep monitoring feedback and data to make sure the flow of each match feels right."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios says its goal is to keep matches moving at a more natural pace, but players aren’t convinced that reduced ticket requirements are what Battlefield 6 needs. In fact, many now say they're happy to play out 1000-ticket matches and enjoy the stress of last-minute comebacks. What's really hampering the pace for many isn't large ticket requirement that result in the timer running out – it's the timer itself.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">why have a time limit? what’s wrong with longer games? i swear back in the day a conquest game used to run for 30-40 minutes</p>— reece (@reece_us) <a href="https://twitter.com/reece_us/status/1978462255608914183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"The easier solution would just be to remove the time limits," content creator <a href="https://x.com/MoiDawg/status/1978464857952284858" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MoiDawg replied</a>. "Close games are incredible and this artifical time limit ruins comebacks. Just let us play Conquest. I'm not joining a Conquest game thinking it'll be over in 20 minutes. Huge L."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other Battlefield 6 fans agree, with many already taking to the replies of the post to recommend simply increasing the timer or removing it altogether. Some are surprised to see any changes at all, explaining that they have yet to see a match reach the time limit even after dozens of hours of Conquest play time. There are some who report experiencing matches that run through the time limit, but even they believe slightly longer matches could remedy the problem altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Couldn’t just add 10 minutes to the timer?" one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o7c0aw/comment/njmhpb6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user suggests</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"God forbid a conquest match lasts more than 15 minutes," another <a href="https://x.com/son_excla/status/1978462798876168497" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X reply adds</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, BF Studios added in <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978473627235561693" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a separate post</u></a> that the Out of Bounds timer for vehicles on Battlefield 6’s Manhattan Bridge map in Conquest and Escalation have been increased from five to 10 seconds. While the community already appears to be accepting this change with open arms, the announcement post itself has already been met with more calls to revert the new Conquest ticket changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players who load into a Battlefield 6 Conquest match are currently told to expect the average match to last 20 minutes, though games have been known to last anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes. Today's hotfix is already in effect, so it's unclear if BF Studios and EA have any plans to walk back the changes quite yet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 10. The BF Studios team has kept up communication in the days since, delivering hotfix after hotfix as it works to adjust to the desires of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-off-to-huge-start-on-steam-with-over-740000-concurrent-players-just-hours-after-launch">a player base that quickly exploded upon its release</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll have to wait to see if the developers plan to react to the feedback they're receiving from fans.
