Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Step into the shadows as an acolyte of the Inquisition in Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy, a second narrative-driven tactical RPG set in the beloved grimdark universe. Set against the backdrop of the Noctis Aeterna and the mystery of the Tyrant Star, players will lead a warband of diverse companions in a desperate battle against heresy and corruption — from loyal Imperial subjects, such as a veteran Guardsman from the death world of Catachan, to nefarious xenos, including a bird-like Kroot mercenary. </blockquote><blockquote>With intricate investigations, a turn-based combat system, and choices that carry grave consequences, Dark Heresy is set to deliver an atmospheric dive into the brutality and mysticism of one of the Imperium’s most feared organizations. The game greatly expands on the ideas introduced in Rogue Trader and features fully voiced dialogues.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy is due out on PC (Steam, GOG, Epic Games Store) and PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S.

A new 15-hour storyline introduces the Adeptus Arbites, a faction of incorruptible enforcers, and a new companion — the grim and relentless Solomorne Anthar. With battle Familiars like cybernetic eagles and cyber-mastiffs, this DLC "enriches the gameplay and narrative layers" of Rogue Trader and will be available to all players on June 24, 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Also announced is Season Pass 2 for Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, bundling two new expansions and an appearance customization pack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The third major addition to the game will allow players to enter a Necron vault curated by fan-favorite Trazyn the Infinite, challenge ancient guardians, and uncover relics tied to the Von Valancius legacy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fourth will let players explore the Processional of the Damned — a surreal voidship graveyard, in a "descent into madness and mystery." Each of these DLCs will feature a new companion character, new quests deeply integrated into the main storyline, new mechanics, and deliver around 15 hours of gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy was announced during the Warhammer Skulls 2025 broadcast.

The hope is of course that Relic uses this release as a platform for the creation of a brand new Dawn of War game; Dawn of War 4 perhaps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Definitive Edition includes all the Dawn of War and standalone expansion content (four classic Dawn of War campaigns, nine armies, and over 200 maps all in one game). There’s 4K support, upscaled textures (4x the originals), and image-based lighting for a higher level of fidelity while retaining the classic experience. World lighting, unit reflections, and shadows have all been improved, and new unit gloss and emissive lighting “will faithfully enhance the moment-to-moment action.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The camera now lets you pull back further to see more on-screen, and the HUD and screen layout have been optimized for widescreen viewing. Dawn of War has also been upgraded to a 64-bit platform to support the ongoing efforts of the modding community and will be compatible with over 20 years of community mods upon release.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Definitive Edition celebrates the original Dawn of War and preserves the legacy of this landmark Warhammer 40,000 title for years to come,” said Justin Dowdeswell, CEO at Relic Entertainment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Warhammer 40,000 is more popular than ever, and we want new players to experience where the classic Dawn of War franchise began, while providing a platform for our long-time fans to relive it in its entirety.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition was announced during the Warhammer Skulls 2025 broadcast.
