            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">In Japan, Capcom has teamed up with a company known for its shopping channel-style infomercials, to release a bizarre and extremely limited edition of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> that includes exercise equipment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Limited to only 50 sets and priced at 19,800yen ($127), the Terrifying Nightmare Set made in collaboration with e-commerce/talent management Yume Group sold out completely in less than 5 hours, as fans reached for their credit cards faster than they ever ran from Mr. X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem's Terrifying Nightmare Set includes a copy of Resident Evil Requiem on either PS5 or Switch 2 and a full-sized pull-up bar for exercising. Yes, you read it right. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— バイオハザード(カプコン)公式 (@BIO_OFFICIAL) <a href="https://twitter.com/BIO_OFFICIAL/status/2024620585528283618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In Japan, Yume Group (Dream Group) is known for its catchphrase "make it cheaper!" and for selling all sorts of shopping channel-style products via their website and through commercials. Naturally, the Resident Evil Requiem Terrifying Nightmare Set has its own tongue-in-cheek commercial — which you can watch above — in which Yume Group president Shigehiro Ishida and affiliated singer Yuri Hoshina promote the game in their signature style, with Ishida introducing the selling points and Hoshina exclaiming enthusiastically in response. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Brilliantly, the commercial even features Resident Evil Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi, who makes a rather deadpan cameo wearing industrial workwear and an unconvincing wig. Nakanishi mentions Requiem’s dual protagonists Grace and Leon, and the game’s mix of horror and action, while these keywords flash boldly on screen.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what's with the pull-up bar? The idea here is apparently so that gamers can use this piece of freestanding exercise equipment — dubbed the "Dream Hanging Health Device" — to release tension after fighting off zombies and getting perplexed by puzzles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When you’re tired from gaming, hang on tight. It'll loosen up your back and shoulders stiff from fright!" advises the product's <a href="https://yumeg.com/view/item/000000011379?cptokusetsu" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>store page</u></a>. The accompanying tongue-in-cheek infomercial advertises the pull-up bar while showing shots of a terrified Grace Ashcroft hanging upside down from the game's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POz1-EmLsTY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reveal trailer</u></a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other moments from the commercial include Hoshina cheerfully exclaiming that the game is "easy for even beginners to start playing," while the 'You are Dead' game over screen plays in the background, and an apparent claim that the exercise equipment is also good for drying laundry on a rainy day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When official Resident Evil accounts in Japan suddenly started posting a Yume Group infomercial on the morning of February 20th, some users thought it was simply a parody. "I started watching it with a smirk, laughing at the image of Grace hanging upside down on the device but then went dead serious when the detailed purchase rules and phone number came up 'Huh? They’re actually selling this?!'" a user <a href="https://x.com/yamaken183/status/2024622925635342696?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented</u></a> in Japanese on X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, just five hours later the Terrifying Nightmare Set was sold out. Perhaps some Resident Evil fans aspire to get chainsaw-wielding worthy biceps like Leon S. Kennedy’s, whose <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/leon-kennedys-new-look-for-resident-evil-requiem-makes-him-a-hot-uncle-heartthrob-among-japanese-fans"><u>new look has won him a bit of a fan following</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Leon and unexpected Resident Evil special editions, who can forget <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/04/11/1240-resident-evil-6-platinum-edition">Resident Evil 6’s Leather Jacket Edition which came with a replica of Leon’s coat</a> and retailed for 109,000 yen ($1,300) back in 2012?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West. She has also written about Japanese culture and movies for various publications.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-has-a-bizarre-ultra-limited-edition-with-exercise-equipment-in-japan-and-it-sold-out-almost-instantly]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-winterspell-most-expensive-cards</link>
            <guid>1441864</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney Lorcana has just launched its 11th new set, Winterspell, and there's a whole lot to like about it already. The new frost-themed card art is sublime, and it's undeniably a particularly cosy expansion before we look ahead to the highly anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-full-release-schedule-2026">Wilds Unknown expansion in May</a>, featuring fan favorite Pixar characters for the first time.</p><p id="winterspells-10-top-chase-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Winterspell's 10 Top Chase Cards">Lorcana: Winterspell - 10 Best Chase Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">But enough on that, let's take a look at what's really rocking for single card collectors in Winterspell, including two brand new iconic rares that are already demanding a mighty high price (we're talking thousands of dollars), and unsurprisingly, feature some of the finest art I've ever seen in a trading card game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using <a href="https://zdcs.link/a56qVx?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">data from our friends at TCGplayer</a>, here are the 10 most valuable Disney Lorcana cards to come out of the new Winterspell expansion.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">10 - Tod - Knows All the Tricks (Enchanted)</h3><div id="235529"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235529" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tod - Knows All the Tricks (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another absolutely adorable card that I can't get enough of from Winterspell, is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLp3k0?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tod - Knows All the Tricks</a>. The Enchanted variant is looking fairly valuable as well, currently sitting at around $190 market price, while its <a href="https://zdcs.link/QW6qMl?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legendary is fetching around $6-$8 right now as well</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His ability to ready up again twice per turn when chosen for an action or an item's ability seems fairly good to me as well, with a high ceiling for shenanigans, from my initial impressions at least. I'm certainly going to be chasing after Tod, and I suspect plenty of fans will be as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">9 - The Cold Never Bothered Me (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235519"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235519" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Cold Never Bothered Me (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course we're getting some delightful Frozen themed cards in the Winterspell set, it would be crime not to. And, 'The Cold Never Bothered Me' (anyway?) is one for collectors to absolutely keep a sharp eye out for, especially its delightful Enchanted version. Market price highs are reaching around $171.49 right now, and I've got a funny feeling this valuation will continue to rise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It features some incredible card art of Elsa, funnily enough from an artist also named Elsa (Elsa Chang, to be exact). It reads: "Look at the top 4 cards of your deck. You may reveal a location card and put it into your hand. Put the rest into your discard. You pay 3 Ink less for the next location you play this turn."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">8 - Raging Storm (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235530"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235530" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Raging Storm (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Enchanted card demanding a high price is Raging Storm, featuring Nani, Lilo, and Stitch with some wonderful card art from Jane Pica.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's demanding a fairly high price right now at <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yPj7O?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$126.26 at TCGplayer</a>, but if you really want this card, you can also just pick up its <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoJxlL?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Super Rare variant for around $4</a> instead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, it's another Winterspell card that Collectors are bound to be all over, and chasing as for it as hard as they can. Keep an eye on this one, as I think it's got a whole lot of value potential even further into the future as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">7 - Eeyore - In the Way (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235525"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235525" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Eeyore - In the Way (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This might be one of my favorite ever cards to come out of Disney Lorcana. This full card art of Eeyore - In the Way, by Gabby Zapata, is absolutely stunning, and worth the high price of the card alone. If I get lucky and manage to pull this sweetheart, then even better. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Running for around $130 at market on TCGplayer right now, this is still a hot card to come by, even if it just misses out on a top ten ranking by value. And while it doesn't reach the eye watering values of the rest of the cards coming up on this list, at $130+, it's still a unbelievably good pull if you manage to score it. It's a card I'm absolutely on the look out for right now.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">6 - Belle - Snowfield Strategist (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235566"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235566" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Belle - Snowfield Strategist (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Featuring some wonderful art from Jane Pica, this enchanted variant of Beauty and the Beast's "Belle - Snowfield Strategist" has got all the makings of an increasingly valuable card, in the short and long term. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It reads: "[Winter Stockpile] Whenever one of your characters is banished, you may put that card from your discard into your inkwell facedown and exerted."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sitting at around $145.48 on TCGplayer right now, I can only seeing it going up in value over the next few months. Let's wait and see.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"> 5 - Angel - Experiment 624 (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235565"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235565" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Angel - Experiment 624 (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Angel - Experiment 624 is just an incredible well rounded card, and a great addition to the Winterspell expansion, so I'm not surprised that it's fetching a tidy price at launch. The Legendary card is sitting at around $24.76 right now on TCGplayer, while the stunning Enchanted variant is at $177.84, and there's no surprise why. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Community sentiment around Angel, who features heavily on Winterspell key art across its marketing and sealed product selection, has been incredibly positive so far. Prices could come down a little bit as we get further away from launch, but I've got a funny feeling it's going to hold out for a while longer. If you manage to find this one, I'd avoid selling and hold on, at least that's what I'll be doing.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">4 - Ohana Means Family (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235528"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235528" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ohana Means Family (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Featuring both Lilo and Stitch, this Enchanted action card is already hovering just shy of the $200 market mark, and it boasts some genuinely charming artwork from Kei Yotsuba. Its Legendary card version has decent value right now as well, sitting at <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN3xky?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$27.19 at TCGplayer's market price</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mechanically, it is more or less a rework of <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l8nqr?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rapunzel - Gifted with Healing from The First Chapter</a>, carrying almost the exact same effect, but as an action card, and being potentially slightly less flexible in real play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rather than capping the effect, like Rapunzel did at three damage, Ohana Means Family instead removes all damage from one of your characters and lets you draw a card for each point healed in the process. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">3 - Anna - Soothing Sister (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235517"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235517" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anna - Soothing Sister (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Frozen-themed card from Winterspell, this time focusing on Anna. Soothing Sister's Enchanted card art is another beautiful example from the new set. It's currently worth just over $200 at TCGplayer, and it's easy to see why. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can see this as another card from the latest set that will continue to rise in value over the next few weeks. If you manage to pull it, hold on for a bit longer. And if you fancy a solid investment, well look no further.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">2 - Pocahontas - Peacekeeper (Iconic)</h3></div><div id="235526"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235526" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pocahontas - Peacekeeper (Iconic)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first of two Iconics from the Winterspell expansion, and I can already see why this is going to be a huge chase card for both players and collectors. Sitting at just over $400, I'm hardly surprised that Pocahontas - Peacekeeper is demanding such a high price already. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, there's a whole lot of potential in the card itself, even if you want to just opt for the equally as beautiful, if a little less expensive, <a href="https://zdcs.link/ae8PWw?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legendary variant (which is valued at just under $6 right now)</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Easily paired with <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3OvWM?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pocahontas - Following the Wind</a>, also featured in Winterspell, this puts you on a one way train to locking down the board for a full turn and completely shutting off your opponent's ability to challenge. That is not a small effect, and just the tiniest bit mad, all things considered. I love it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">1 - Moana - Curious Explorer (Iconic)</h3></div><div id="235527"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235527" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Moana - Curious Explorer (Iconic)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The demand on this card is honestly mind-boggling. But, I can also get behind it. The card art by Leslie Strock is to die for, and it's probably one of my favorite designs I've ever seen in a trading card game, let alone Lorcana itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, <em>the price</em> is eye-wateringly high. There's something to be said about never having to ink a card from your hand again, which is why the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yPj1P?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legendary variant</a> we mentioned earlier is also spiking at decent value since launch (sitting at around $26), but the Iconic rare is just on another planet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like, come on, $550 - that's nuts? That's playing ball with some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-top-10-most-valuable-cards-from-last-year-2025">rarest Pokémon</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-most-valuable-cards-2025-updated">Magic: The Gathering cards</a>. Let's go, Lorcana, I guess, making its very own economy with every release is as impressive as it sounds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm skeptical that it can maintain such a high demand going forward, but since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-fabled-most-expensive-cards">Fabled introduced Iconic</a> rarity, it has certainly introduced the perfect height of card chasing for what is a TCG somewhat still in its infancy. Best to just see where things go next, cross your fingers, and then throw an enormous party if you manage to pull such a rare card when ripping packs. </p></div><p id="where-to-buy-winterspell"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to Buy - Winterspell">Where to Buy - Disney Lorcana: Winterspell</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some quick honorable mentions before I finished up, as it's also worth keeping an eye on several other Winterspell cards that look like they have plenty of potential. That includes <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7RbLE?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lilo - Rock Star</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QG8VvV?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Darkwing Duck - Cool Under Pressure</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wBGrR?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mulan - Resourceful Recruit</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to find any of these cards, rather than buying them outright as singles, then you'll want to pick up some Winterspell boosters ASAP. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-tcg-winterspell-where-to-buy">Winterspell is now available to buy</a> at most major retailers, but I'd recommend at least picking up the Booster Display Pack for $144 at Amazon to really get you started with the new set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The booster display comes with 24 packs, with each booster packs setting you up with 12 cards, including six Common cards, three Uncommon cards, two cards of either Rare, Super Rare, or Legendary rarity, and one random foil card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a little bit of everything, I'd recommend checking out the Illumineer's Trove for $50, which comes with a card storage box, six card dividers, eight booster packs, six damage-counter dice, and a lore counter. Perfect for any newcomers to Lorcana, or as a tidy gift for any Disney fans in your life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is IGN's Senior Commerce Editor and resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.
