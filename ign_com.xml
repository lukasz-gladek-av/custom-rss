            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> finally has a new update with much-needed performance improvements and tweaks to the difficulty settings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda said update 1.2 focuses on fixes for quests, gameplay, and performance, and includes new damage settings. 1.2 won’t roll out to all platforms just yet, Bethesda added, but it will be released today, July 9, on Steam Beta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A performance patch was much needed. Oblivion Remastered has enjoyed a hugely successful launch, with over 4 million players and a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam (although that's since fallen to 'mostly positive'). However, if there’s one issue that continues to crop up, it’s performance problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-revisited-profound-problems-have-yet-to-be-addressed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a> found Oblivion Remastered on consoles to have significant problems across the board. DF’s Thomas Morgan said of Virtuos’ Unreal Engine 5 overhaul:</p><blockquote>No platform is spared of issues: whether it's PS5, PS5 Pro, or either Xbox Series machine, all struggle with traversal hitches while roaming the open world. Secondly, there's major sub-60fps frame-rates, where I've also discovered that performance slowly degrades with more playing time — quite possibly down to a memory leak. And finally, software freezes are the icing on the cake, with all PlayStation and Xbox platforms crashing to the system menu on loading a save one too many times.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">How does this manifest itself in-game? According to DF, a “charged” playthrough with more continuous play time behind it performs worse than a fresh boot. Cycling through saves also introduces bugs in the charged playthrough, Morgan revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And this is particularly curious: this also leads to the camera position being too high while riding horseback. You can fix this by resetting the game. The update 1.2 patch notes, below, include "Fixed player character height scaling," which may be a fix for this specific issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a dire position for any remaster to be in and developer Virtuos needs to address the game's stability - the crashes - as a priority,” DF continued. That’s a damning assessment of Oblivion on console, but what about PC? DF called PC performance “dire.” It’s worth checking out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-is-one-of-the-worst-performing-pc-games-weve-ever-tested" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DF’s analysis in full</u></a> for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology. The changes are going down well with fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake"><u>some of whom believe Oblivion Remastered would be more accurately described as a remake</u></a>.

The special box is now available again for just £44.99, marked down from its usual market value of £84.95, but you’ll need to request an invite to purchase.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box</h2><div catalogid="5ff3030f-51b6-4106-a2b6-6e881ad1e801" id="224714"><div id="224714" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This limited, invite-only system is the same approach Amazon UK previously used for high-demand sets like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-amazon-invite-requests-151-and-prismatic-evolutions-sets-uk">151 and Prismatic Evolutions</a>. It’s a strategy aimed at cutting out scalpers and ensuring real collectors have a fair shot. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rather than competing against bots or watching third-party prices skyrocket, Amazon’s invite model gives fans the opportunity to buy at retail, without the usual stress. While receiving an invite doesn’t guarantee a purchase, it significantly improves your chances over a general public listing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar with the Destined Rivals expansion from Scarlet &amp; Violet, the Elite Trainer Box includes everything needed to dive into the set. Inside, you’ll find:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>9 Destined Rivals booster packs </li><li>1 full-art foil Wobbuffet promo card</li><li>65 themed card sleeves</li><li>45 Energy cards</li><li>Player’s guide, damage-counter dice, flip coins, markers, and a collector’s box with dividers</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this makes it ideal for both new players and seasoned collectors looking to build their collection if they haven't had chance to partake in the expansion yet. That's especially with Prime Day offering a rare discount and first-party availability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve missed out on past Elite Trainer Box drops due to inflated resale prices or rapid sellouts, this invite-request system might be your best chance yet. Head to Amazon UK, sign in with your account, and hit the “Request Invite” button on the Destined Rivals ETB product page to be in with a chance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you do recieve a "you've been invited" email, you'll have 72 hours to make your purchase before the offer lapses. Be sure to keep checking your emails so you don't miss out.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 9, 2025 1:56 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-etbs-are-back-in-stock-at-amazon-uk-for-prime-day-but-theres-a-catch]]></content:encoded>
