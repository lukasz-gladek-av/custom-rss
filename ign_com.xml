            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has finally acknowledged the never-ending deluge of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> remake leaks, after yet another slip-up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/looks-like-an-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-statue-just-leaked-via-vinted">collectible statue featuring the game's hero Edward Kenway bizarrely popped up for sale</a> on used clothing app Vinted. The item appeared to be the under-wraps tie-in teased last year by merchandise maker Pure Arts — and now, Ubisoft has effectively confirmed that this is the case. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Writing on Twitter / X, Ubisoft used its official Assassin's Creed account to <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/2016531108486095252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2016531108486095252%7Ctwgr%5Ee6e1977daeaec6ece2a62381c01171e2fdc43ba0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fah-s-here-we-go-again-ubisoft-acknowledges-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-leak-responds-with-gta-meme" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">respond</a> to the original post that shared photos of said statue, replying with the classic GTA San Andreas meme showing that game's protagonist Carl Johnson wearily stating: "Ah s***, here we go again." </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/IRDhrgCPAp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/IRDhrgCPAp</a></p>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/2016531108486095252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 28, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The statue's appearance online follows a hint by collectible company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-swirl-as-collectible-maker-admits-there-is-something-going-on">Pure Arts last year suggesting it had something in the works for Black Flag</a> which would surface in the not-too-distant future as "there is something going on." Its Vinted listing gave no clue to its origins, though stated that it was due for release in 2026. A detailed close-up of the statue's base shown in photos displayed logos for Ubisoft and Pure Arts, with a copyright mark registered for 2026. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this now out there, alongside everything else that has leaked about the game, it's perhaps unsurprising that Ubisoft has now given up pretending there's nothing going on. While clearly a humorous response, this also marks the first time Ubisoft has ever commented on anything to do with the Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake, despite a long, long string of reports and leaks surrounding its existance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most notable confirmation of the project came from Edward Kenway's own voice actor, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-edward-kenway-actor-alleges-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-for-hinting-at-black-flag-remake">initially teased the project</a> before later suggesting he'd been told by Ubisoft in no uncertain terms to stop talking. Finally, last month, the game popped up on the PEGI European ratings board website revealing what looks to be its final title: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, Ubisoft has only referred to the game's impending launch by acknowledging it had an unannounced game due to arrive before the end of its current financial year on March 31. Last week, however, this game was then delayed into the coming financial year (ending March 31, 2027) due to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure">company's major recent reshuffle of teams, projects and studios</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

But, with the latest delay, this means that just a single sealed product will now be available to fans during its release week.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/oSpnpZgEKl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/oSpnpZgEKl</a></p>— Pokémon TCG (@PokemonTCG) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCG/status/2016587217083199505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 28, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The new set is already getting a fairly staggered release, with the majority of products now releasing between February 20 and April 24. That includes some of the most popular items from a new Pokémon card set, such as the Elite Trainer Box, Booster Bundles, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The delayed booster set features a promo card with either Erika’s Tangela or Larry’s Komala, a metallic coin featuring the chosen Gym Leader, and two booster packs from the <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-ascended-heroes-product-showcase" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mega Evolution - Ascended Heroes expansion</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only new booster set available in release week will be the Ascended Heroes Tech Sticker Collection, featuring Charmander and Ghastly as a foil promo card, plus a sheet of tech stickers featuring Mega Charizard Y and Mega Gengar, plus three Ascended Heroes boosters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's already been hard to come by Ascended Heroes preorders, and undoubtedly this delay won't make it any easier for fans after release day. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-ascended-heroes-sealed-products-are-up-for-preorder-at-tcgplayer">Ascended Heroes ETBs</a>, for example, are currently averaging around <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOjX3M?object_uuid=3e050d85-f909-4c14-bed0-d0f49191e04d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$115-120 on resale markets</a> - around a 135% markup from its MSRP of $49.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ascended Heroes' Booster Bundles are also looking a little steep right now, and sit at $79.10 market price. That's a fair lot more than its $26.94 list price, roughly a 194% markup, and almost triple the cost for what accounts for just six boosters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a similar story across the board, with fans likely to find it tough to find boosters from the new expansion outside of retailers like TCGplayer. That's also consistent with the follow up expansion for Mega Evolution, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-perfect-order-sealed-products-are-up-for-preorder-at-tcgplayer">Perfect Order</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ascended Heroes being hard to come by won't be surprising for most fans. The scarcity of the Mega Evolution series isn't exactly an outlier for Pokémon TCG, with stock issues, lack of common availibility, and delays plaguing the world's most popular trading card game for the past couple of years, at least, and stretches back through its Scarlet and Violet series as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson, Senior Commerce Editor, and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.
