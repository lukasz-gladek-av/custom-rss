Developing a remake and a new title simultaneously naturally involves risks, but we wanted to convey our commitment first and foremost. Only when a new game is announced can the future of a series be seen. Users won’t feel motivated to engage with an IP unless they can sense it has a future. If the company takes a wait-and-see approach, so will the players. The company needs to show how serious it is so that users can get genuinely excited. I think that’s only fair."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all the projects revealed since that 2022 showcase — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-the-short-message"><u>Silent Hill: The Short Message</u></a>, Silent Hill 2 Remake, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f"><u>Silent Hill f</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-townfall"><u>Silent Hill: Townfall</u></a>, and media projects <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-ascension"><u>Silent Hill: Ascension</u></a> and the upcoming movie, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/return-to-silent-hill"><u>Return to Silent Hill</u></a> — the majority have been received well by critics, fans, and new players alike, suggesting it was a gamble worth taking for the Japanese publisher.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Silent Hill Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-hit-25-million-as-franchise-surpasses-10-million">Silent Hill 2 Remake has sold 2.5 million worldwide</a>, which pushes sales of the franchise overall to 10 million. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-sold-1-million-copies-in-a-day-konami-says-achievement-reinforces-the-series-status-as-an-iconic-horror-franchise">Silent Hill f has sold 1 million copies</a>.
