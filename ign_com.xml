That’s right: Universes Beyond Booster Boxes are pricier than Universes Within just because.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, this deal nets you 30 packs of 14 cards each at a price of $5.33 per pack, a drop from the $6.99 you’d pay at full price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A similar thing happened with Magic’s Spider-Man set this year, which seemingly underperformed by just about every metric, but Avatar Play Booster boxes were also discounted and that set was much more promising - so a discount at this point isn’t necessarily a reflection of how good or bad the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more Magic: The Gathering deals, be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magics-avatar-products-are-on-sale-and-will-arrive-before-christmas"><u>our coverage of Avatar: The Last Airbender products you can still get before Christmas</u></a> (including discounts), as well as a way to nab <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/get-four-commander-decks-from-one-of-magics-most-underrated-sets-at-a-steep-discount-from-amazon"><u>two underrated Commander decks</u></a> from this year for you and a friend to play right out of the box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.
