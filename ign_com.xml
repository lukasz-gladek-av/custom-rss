            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/on-bloodbornes-10th-birthday-and-with-neither-a-sequel-nor-a-next-gen-update-in-sight-fans-once-again-organize-a-return-to-yharnam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> turns 10 years old today, and fans are celebrating by organizing yet another return to Yharnam community event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FromSoftware’s PlayStation 4 masterpiece launched on March 24, 2015, and helped cement the Japanese developer as one of the greatest of our time. Critical and commercial acclaim followed, and a follow-up in the vein of the Dark Souls sequels seemed inevitable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But since then… nothing. Why hasn’t Sony followed up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bloodborne"><u>Bloodborne</u></a> with either a current-gen remaster, a full-on sequel, or at the very least a next-gen update that would finally make it officially playable in 60fps? Fans have begged Sony for more Bloodborne ever since it came out. The deafening silence in response remains one of the most puzzling business decisions in all video games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, we got an explanation of sorts. Following his exit from Sony, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hasnt-sony-done-anything-more-with-bloodborne-playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-personal-theory">PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida revealed his Bloodborne no-show theory</a>. To be clear up front: this is Yoshida’s opinion, which in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an interview with Kinda Funny Games</u></a> he stressed was not inside information, or the reveal of the current deliberations within the bowels of Sony itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing,” Yoshida said. “And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Miyazaki-san is of course Hidetaka Miyazaki, the boss of FromSoftware. And yes, he’s incredibly successful. Not only for the influential Dark Souls series, but, most recently, the mainstream hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring"><u>Elden Ring</u></a>, which propelled FromSoftware to new heights. So much so that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service"><u>it’s getting a multiplayer spin-off this year</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS4 Games (Summer 2020 Update)</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And it seems obvious to say Miyazaki will be incredibly busy with multiple projects to direct and a company to run. After Bloodborne came out in 2015, Miyazaki directed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dark-souls-iii"><u>Dark Souls 3</u></a>, then 2019’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice"><u>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</u></a> for Activision, then the aforementioned Elden Ring for Bandai Namco. What's next? Miyazaki has yet to say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In interviews, Miyazaki often deflects questions about Bloodborne, pointing to the fact FromSoftware does not own the IP. But in February last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5"><u>Miyazaki at least admitted the game would benefit from a release on more modern hardware</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the years since, modders have tried to fill the gaps with fan-made projects that improve upon the base PS4 Bloodborne experience. But Sony has taken a dim view. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-bloodborne-60fps-patch-says-sony-has-sent-him-a-dmca-takedown-but-why-now">Well-known Bloodborne 60fps mod creator Lance McDonald announced in January</a> that he’d received a takedown notification on behalf of Sony Interactive Entertainment “asking that I remove links to the patch I posted on the internet, so I've now done so.” The DMCA takedown arrived four years after the mod was released.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, just a week later, Lilith Walther<u>,</u> creator of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nightmare-kart-bloodborne-kart-release-date">Nightmare Kart</a>, which was previously known as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-ps1-demake-developer-announces-bloodborne-kart">Bloodborne Kart</a>, and the eye-catching Bloodborne PSX demake, tweeted to say an old YouTube video of the demake was hit with a copyright claim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Recently, fans managed to get PS4 emulators to deliver something akin to a remaster on PC. The tech experts at <a href="https://youtu.be/-zjzBbdl7hk?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry released a video</u></a> covering “a breakthrough in PS4 emulation” via ShadPS4, which means Bloodborne is now fully playable start to finish in 60fps. Could this breakthrough have triggered an aggressive response from Sony? IGN asked Sony for comment at the time, but it has yet to respond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s all we have to go on, really, which leaves Bloodborne fans to take it upon themselves to organize Return to Yharnam community events. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/1jil17v/return_to_yharnam_2025_march_24_april_7th/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another kicks off today</a>, on Bloodborne’s 10th anniversary, and calls on fans to create a new character, and summon as many random cooperators and invaders as possible, and leave in-game messages flagging they’re a part of this latest community drive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps this will be all that’s left for fans to do in the world of Bloodborne forever more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The changes, documented on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/history/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a>, include an opt-in for Hollow Knight: Silksong on GeForce Now, Nvidia’s video game streaming platform, changed assets, and, crucially, a change to the Steam store page’s legal lines so Hollow Knight is listed as copyright Team Cherry 2025, not 2019.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all points to something Hollow Knight: Silksong-related happening soon, a potential 2025 release, and with Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct set for April 2, fans may not have long to wait to find out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gameplay-trailer-news"><u>been six years since </u></a>Hollow Knight: Silksong’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gameplay-trailer-news"><u>announcement</u></a>. In the years since there have been spots of new information, but long periods of radio silence from the developers at Team Cherry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">January, however, was a particularly busy month for deranged Hollow Knight fans, with cryptic X/Twitter activity from one developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake"><u>sparking rampant speculation </u></a>about a potential re-reveal during the Switch 2 direct — and potentially even release on Nintendo’s next-gen console as a timed launch exclusive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembering that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-sequel-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch"><u>when Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced</u></a>, Team Cherry confirmed the launch platforms as Windows, Mac, Linux, and Nintendo Switch. It's also one of the most-wanted Game Pass games following Microsoft’s deal with Team Cherry to bring Silksong to its subscription service day-one.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 - First Look</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In June 2022, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-release-window-next-12-months">Microsoft included Hollow Knight: Silksong in its Xbox-Bethesda Showcase</a>, and announced that everything shown would be playable in the next 12 months. Xbox then seemingly confirmed that the long-awaited follow-up would indeed be out within a year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, in May 2023, Team Cherry announced that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-team-cherry-release-date-update">Hollow Knight: Silksong had been delayed</a> past the first half of 2023 and that more details would come as the game neared its release date. At the time, Team Cherry’s marketing and publishing lead Matthew Griffin said: “We had planned to release in the first half of 2023, but development is still continuing. We're excited by how the game is shaping up, and it's gotten quite big, so we want to take the time to make the game as good as we can.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the sequel to 2017’s critically acclaimed Hollow Knight, Silksong has huge expectation around it, and remains one of the most wishlisted games on Steam. In IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/22/hollow-knight-review">Hollow Knight review</a>, we said: "The world of Hallownest is compelling and rich, full of story that’s left for you to discover on your own, and built with branching paths that offer an absurd amount of choice in how you go about discovering it. With such a high density of secrets to find and fun, challenging enemies to face, it’s worth spending every moment you can in Hollow Knight.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

His videos and his mod hit the headlines in January as information-starved GTA fans flocked to experience a fan-made approximation of what they can expect to play officially when GTA 6 launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S this fall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, last week, Dark Space received the dreaded strike notification from YouTube after Take-Two issued a copyright removal request. If a YouTube channel receives multiple copyright strikes, it runs the risk of being terminated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Dark Space removed all download links to his mod, despite the fact he has yet to be asked to do so by Take-Two, and published <a href="https://youtu.be/7LmLfJAuR_U?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a response video</a> on his channel calling out the company for its actions and suggesting it was the result of the mod's take on GTA 6's map being "probably a little too accurate."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Space was more philosophical in a follow-up interview with IGN. “I expected this would happen based on their past takedowns,” the modder said. “I went into this project knowing it was a possibility, and the fact that it happened does not surprise me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Space said he believes Take-Two went after his mod because it was based on an online GTA 6 community mapping project that uses leaked coordinate points to “perfectly” map out the upcoming virtual space, and as a result might have ruined the surprise for players and the internet at large.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's probably the biggest red flag, although most of the work in my map was based on the trailer shots,” Dark Space added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think my map could have ruined the surprise of their map, which I get. If you spent years building out this amazing game world just to have some YouTuber spoil the experience of the map's shape, size, and vibe... I'd want it removed too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is Dark Space’s GTA 6 mod project is no more. And that’s not just for YouTube videos of it, that’s for the entire thing. “Well they clearly do not want this project to exist,” Dark Space said. “So it's not just under threat, it's eliminated. There’s no point putting more time into something that goes directly against what they’re willing to allow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm just going to keep making videos that people hopefully like. I probably won't do anything else modding GTA 5 in relation to GTA 6, since it seems dangerous.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are now concerns that the GTA 6 community mapping project could be next in Take-Two’s sights.
