To stop this from happening, we'd recommend <strong>copying and pasting the code directly from this article</strong>. We check and test each of the codes before we add them to our articles. However, when copying them, you can sometimes accidentally include an extra space somewhere, so always double check there's no additional spaces!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lauren Harper is an Associate Guides Editor.

We make sure to check and test every Climb and Jump Tower code before we add them to this article.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A common reason for codes to not work in this Roblox game is because they're case-sensitive. That means you have to type it exactly the same way in this article. Otherwise, it won't work if it has different letters capitalized or lowercase.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Find More Climb and Jump Tower Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We always recommend checking our article here for up to date codes since you can rely on us to verify which ones are working. But, if you'd prefer to search for some Climb and Jump Tower codes on your own, you can check the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/qUAuMNB3qw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated Discord server</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Climb and Jump Tower in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Climb and Jump Tower is a Roblox experience where the name tells you everything it's about. Climb massive tall towers based on real buildings like the Eiffel Tower or Empire State Building. As you work your way up each one, you'll gain coins upon gliding back down to the bottom. You can then spend those coins to unlock pets and upgrade your wings to climb faster and farther.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jeffrey Lerman is a freelance game journalist for IGN who has been covering games for over a decade.
