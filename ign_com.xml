            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live broadcast has given us a fresh look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> protagonist Grace Ashcroft, but no sign of fan-favorite Leon S. Kennedy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As expected, today's show brought with it a deeper dive into Capcom's hotly-anticipated upcoming survival horror (which is also playable here at Gamescom). Footage once again showed the game's new star Grace Ashcroft in action, though fans were left wondering about Leon's whereabouts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following a phone call from unknown voice, Grace Ashcroft and her mom Alyssa attempt to escape from the hotel in which they had been staying, as the power is cut and the pair are attacked. We already know what happens next, as Grace is seen investigating the hotel years later, as an FBI analyst.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom previously promised that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade-resident-evil-requiem-will-return-to-franchises-original-overarching-narrative-featuring-raccoon-city-and-umbrella">Requiem will feature a return to the series' "overarching narrative"</a> begun 30 years ago, after more recent games such as Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil Village focused on events set elsewhere, with fewer connections to past titles. Already, fans had noted the return of Raccoon City and references to the shadowy Umbrella Corporation, while hoping for more, including a first sighting of Leon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We always thought about making Leon the protagonist," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi previously said</a>, "but making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn't jump at a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he's actually quite a bad match for horror."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many fans took this comment to mean that Leon was still in the game somewhere, likely in sequences that offered more action-orientated gameplay, as while stating the character wouldn't be suitable for horror sections, Nakanishi notably stopped short of ruling the character out altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty of time still until Resident Evil Requiem eventually launches, on February 27, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom and Square Enix took the stage at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74oh7zD_jxI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>gamescom Opening Night Live 2025</u></a> to show off a new collaboration that will see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> collide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and Final Fantasy 14 Online Producer and Director Naoki Yoshida (a.k.a. Yoshi-P) showed up to talk about how two of gaming’s biggest publishers are working to bring some of their biggest franchises together. Two new trailers (below) revealed only a taste of what to expect, including Monster Hunter-themed content for Final Fantasy 14 and Final Fantasy-themed content for Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Final Fantasy 14 content coming to Monster Hunter Wilds kicked off the announcement with a look at how Hunters will be able to use Chocobo to travel during hunts. It's a trailer that also teases appearances from familiar elements like Cactuar as the Capcom team tells players to prepare for "an Omega level threat."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/monsterhunterwilds/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> the Monster Hunter Wilds content coming to Final Fantasy 14, on the other hand, will see players "face an unknown threat in this thrilling new hunt." Its trailer shows off some of the new content you'll be able to enjoy, but there is a catch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In order to participate in the Monster Hunter Wilds-themed update, you'll need to reach level 100 in Final Fantasy 14 and complete its Dawntrail main scenario quest. It's far from a simple feat to achieve and could take new players potentially hundreds of hours to pull off (according to <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/12654" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Howlongtobeat</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If a Monster Hunter fan were to jump into Final Fantasy 14 for the first time today, they could spend around 400 hours working their way through all of the required content. Alternatively, Square Enix's long-running live-service game offers paid options for those who want to skip their way past any entry barriers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using a Tales of Adventure item to skip to level 90 for any one character costs $25 alone, and a second Tales of Adventure item to then skip to Dawntrail also costs $25. That's $50 to go from level 1 to almost meeting the requirements to unlock the Monster Hunter Wilds content, with players then asked to complete the final 10 levels and see Dawntrailer to its conclusion. <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/132429" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Howlongtobeat</a> estimates that it should take players about 48 hours to beat this one Final Fantasy 14 chapter on its own.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds players can expect the new content to arrive in late September as part of Free Title Update 3. Final Fantasy 14 players, meanwhile, can expect to receive their content in early October.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for more updates, be sure to read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at gamescom Opening Night Live 2025</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">At Gamescom Opening Night Live, we just got a look at the opening cinematic for the next World of Warcraft expansion: Midnight. And with it, we got a taste of what to expect at the focal point of the expansion's start: Quel'Thalas, and the Blood Elf city of Silvermoon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a WoW veteran, you probably know Quel'Thalas. It was introduced to World of Warcraft in the first expansion, The Burning Crusade, alongside the introduction of the Blood Elves. Currently in the game, in consists of Silvermoon City and the surrounding Eversong Woods, as well as the northern Isle of Quel'Danas and The Ghostlands to the south. Though it's largely populated by Blood Elves, it's also home to Zul'Aman, the home of the Amani Trolls. As it stands now, Silvermoon and everything to the south serves as a starting zone for low-level Blood Elves (though it's also largely been made obsolete due to the addition of the ubiquitous new player experience, Exile's Reach), while Quel'Danas was an endgame zone in patch 2.4 that's largely useless now if you don't have a very specific reason to be there.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All that is about to change. As we saw in the cinematic, Midnight opens with void menace and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oh-no-everyone-in-world-of-warcraft-is-falling-for-the-hot-evil-lady-who-will-definitely-try-and-kill-us-later">total baddie Xal'atath</a> attacking the Sunwell, a magical power fountain in Quel'Danas that's sacred to the Blood Elves. We're headed there at the start of Midnight to defend it (alongside the thankfully-not-dead Blood Elf leader, Lor'themar Theron), which means that whole area is getting an overhaul. Midnight starts with four zones: a reworked Eversong Woods (which also seems like it will include at least some of Ghostlands), a reworked Zul'Aman (now upgraded from a raid to a full zone), and two new areas: the rootlands of Harandar, and Voidstorm, which seems to be located in a different world entirely. Players will start in Eversong Woods and end in Voidstorm, with Zul'Aman and Harandar able to be done interchangeably.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apologies to the Draenei, though. Burning Crusade's equivalent Alliance class starting zones, Azuremyst and Bloodmyst Isle, and the Draenei hub The Exodar, don't appear to be getting any special treatment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike recent expansions, Midnight will open with not one, but three raids: The Voidspire (six bosses), The Dreamrift (one boss), and March on Quel'Danas (two bosses). World of Warcraft hasn't had multiple raids running at once for several expansions now, so having three at once at launch is a big deal. The expansion also launches with eight new dungeons (including a reworked Magister's Terrace), seven new delves, and a new PvP battleground. There's also a brand new feature called "Prey" where players hunt powerful targets across different world zones, with the potential to be ambushed while on the hunt.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">World of Warcraft: Midnight Cinematic Images and First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for characters, we're not getting any brand new classes. A new allied race, Haranir, will be available, alongside a new mid-range Demon Hunter specialization and Void Elves now also able to become Demon Hunters. There are also some overhauls to the new player experience including new story mode raids for Dragonflight and some other catch-up features. And they're simplifying skyriding, including (thank goodness) getting rid of the vigor bar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the biggest and most exciting feature of Midnight is one we already know about: player housing. We've already heard and seen a lot about what to expect from housing, but Blizzard has re-confirmed that we're getting fully customizable player homes, with 3D placement tools, dyes to recolor furniture, all sorts of decor items available to be earned through all different kinds of content, and private and public neighborhoods. No <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-takes-a-jab-at-final-fantasy-14-with-its-housing-plans">fighting over plots</a> like in Final Fantasy 14, either!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're expecting to hear more details about what we'll see in Midnight throughout Gamescom, so stay tuned to IGN for more on World of Warcraft's latest. Midnight launches in 2026. You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

While the original game’s roster was mostly different versions of Kirby, this sequel lets you play as a number of other characters as well, including King Dedede, Meta Knight, Chef Kawasaki, and Bandana Waddle Dee. All of these characters will have Kirby’s patented copy ability, which lets them copy and use the powers of their enemies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And where the original game featured a single button to press during gameplay, this Switch 2 sequel has added a second button.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">More than two decades after the original Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines, tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live broadcast has finally given us a release date for its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-suffers-yet-another-delay-this-time-to-october-2025">much-delayed sequel</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 will launch on October 21, 2025 for PC via Steam, GOG and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, priced $59.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pre-orders are now live, and will unlock a Bloodlines Nostalgia Jukebox decor item for your Haven base upon release, allowing you to listen to themes from the original Bloodlines game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The nostalgia continues with the Santa Monica Memories cosmetic pack, included with the pricier Deluxe Edition version of the game (priced $69.99), with further items inspired by the original game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Feeling flusher still? A $89.99 Premium verison of the game includes both Santa Monica Memories plus Shadows &amp; Silk, an add-on that provides two additional clans with "unique abilities, playstyles and distinct outfits" for your character. This pack will also be available separately, for $21.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of characters, today's trailer showed a look at the game's day/night gameplay, with sunlight hours set in modern-day Seattle as Elder vampire Phyre, and after-dark gameplay set in a 1920s version of the same city, where you inhabit a dreamlike version of Malkavian detective Fabien. But which reality is actually real? The answer to that is something we'll likely have to wait until October 21, 2025, to find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodlines 2 is developed by The Chinese Room, the acclaimed British indie studio behind last year's oil rig horror game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a>, which recently announced it had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-announces-management-buyout-gaining-independence-from-sumo-digital">completed a management buyout to gain its independence from former parent company Sumo Digital</a>. The studio, which also developed indie darlings Dear Esther and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, has been working on Bloodlines 2 for four years, after a previous version of the game being made by another developer was cancelled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
