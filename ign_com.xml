Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect"><u>other BioWare staff who worked on the game were laid off</u></a>. In the same month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-patch-notes-sure-make-it-sound-like-biowares-basically-done-with-the-game-now"><u>BioWare signalled it had released its final update for Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u></a>, with no further content announced or expected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade">IGN has reported on The Veilguard’s development before</a>, detailing how it was rebooted from a single-player game into a live-service multiplayer game and back again. Now, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/inside-the-dragon-age-debacle-that-gutted-ea-s-bioware-studio" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a> has revealed new insights into the goings on at BioWare during the making of The Veilguard, revealing exactly why it ended up disappointing some fans with a lack of meaningful choice and consequence — key qualities BioWare’s best games are best-known for.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Schreier revealed that many of The Veilguard’s issues were a hangover from the pivot from multiplayer back to single-player RPG, including its tone, dialogue, and lack of tough choices for the player. One tidbit stands out: BioWare was spooked by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-forspoken-sales-were-lackluster-and-its-reception-challenging">the failure of Square Enix’s Forspoken</a>, worrying The Veilguard’s now out of fashion snarky tone would fuel a similar fate. So a “belated rewrite” of the game’s dialogue was ordered to “make it sound more serious.” This, in turn, resulted in tonal inconsistencies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were also internal concerns about how The Veilguard was being marketed (“an initial trailer made the next Dragon Age seem more like Fortnite than a dark fantasy role-playing game, triggering concerns that EA didn’t know how to market the game”).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA declined to comment to Bloomberg on the piece.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of The Veilguard’s failure is that a small team is working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-next-chapter">Mass Effect 5</a>, but there are concerns about BioWare’s future. Dragon Age appears dead following the failure of The Veilguard, which when counting Mass Effect: Andromeda and Anthem is BioWare’s third flop in a row. Could EA close it down?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloomberg quoted TD Cowen analyst Doug Creutz as saying that while EA needs more than sports to be successful, “if they shuttered the doors [of BioWare] tomorrow I wouldn’t be totally surprised. It has been over a decade since they produced a hit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/inside-the-dragon-age-debacle-that-gutted-ea-s-bioware-studio" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg's piece</a> for the full story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
