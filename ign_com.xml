            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/roblox"><u>Roblox</u></a> brought in 1,000 developers to participate in The Hatch, an event the Lego-like game platform says will go down as its biggest Easter Egg hunt ever. While the official experience is propped up as an important moment, thousands of players have already voiced their support for a boycott by using the #BoycottTheHatch across social media.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/core-roblox/The_Hatch_Event_and_Rewards">The Hatch</a> went live earlier today, cracking open its doors for players across the platform to enjoy the work put in by an army of Roblox developers. It’s entirely free-to-play and will no doubt attract millions of players who have been looking forward to the company’s latest Easter Egg hunt experience <a href="https://x.com/DavidBaszucki/status/1931120936645951877" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>for the last month</u></a>. What should be an exciting moment for the community has turned into a controversial stain as players and developers alike band together to opt out of The Hatch in favor of a movement that aims to make the platform safer for all ages forever.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Disappointing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BoycottTheHatch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BoycottTheHatch</a> <a href="https://t.co/J6lhYkY4j1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/J6lhYkY4j1</a></p>— Kakiparks (@CKs_hidingplace) <a href="https://twitter.com/CKs_hidingplace/status/1936205286739706264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Communication from Roblox Corporation has done little to ward off concerns that the gaming giant is failing to protect users from inappropriate content. Though much of the firestorm that’s taken hold of the conversation has subsided, many fear issues surrounding The Hatch are only a symptom of larger issues yet. Community organization opposed to The Hatch could be the start of what players hope will be meaningful change, but they’ve got a long way to go.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is The Hatch?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Prominently featured atop the Roblox home page, The Hatch is an Easter Egg hunt-themed umbrella event that runs from July 2–12 and incorporates a variety of Roblox experiences. Joining the event teleports players to an island realm, which itself serves as an in-between area to hang out in before traveling to a more fleshed-out hub world. In this vacation paradise, users can take in the sights across different colorful biomes while completing quests, challenging others for higher leaderboard spots, and purchasing cosmetic items. It all revolves around one goal: collect as many eggs as possible.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Roblox The Hatch Event - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each painted collectible isn’t found in The Hatch itself, though. Instead, players use the official Roblox hub world to transport themselves to other user-created Roblox experiences via portals placed around the map. Each portal features around 40 games that range from Squid Game obstacle courses to anime-inspired fighting simulators. These are where the eggs can be found, and while they’re often not particularly well hidden, The Hatch and Easter Egg hunts in general have proven to be enticing events that get Roblox players engaged with experiences they know and some they don’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hundreds of Roblox games are included in The Hatch, cementing the event as a crucial limited-time mode with official backing from Roblox Corporation. <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/98209635344835/The-Hatch#!/about" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Hatch’s page</u></a> had more than 46 million visits at the time of this piece’s publication. It also describes an experience that is “suitable for everyone.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Roblox Players Take Action Against a Controversial Creator</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox <a href="https://x.com/Roblox/status/1932838162411540657" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pulled back the curtain</u></a> on The Hatch June 12, marking a return to beloved Easter Egg hunting festivities with more to do and more polish than ever. It was an exciting moment marred by controversy when players caught wind that infamous (and verified) Roblox developer TheOfficiaITeddy had been invited to include his creations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox is a free-to-play platform that is no doubt used by countless children every day, yet, nearly 20 years into its lifespan, Roblox Corporation still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-makes-big-changes-to-parental-controls-amid-pedophile-hellscape-report">finds itself facing accusations that it’s cultivated a dangerous environment for younger players</a>. TheOfficiaITeddy is one developer at the center of the conversation surrounding these topics thanks to his involvement in what many call “condo” games. These social experiences allow players to mingle with one another, but it’s the allegations that Teddy’s condo experiences have featured romantic, dating, and even sex-themed content that have the community ready to take action.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This person has gained HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of visits on games that can only be described as s*x games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“This person has gained HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of visits on games that can only be described as s*x games,” one popular post from X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/RoCatchers/status/1934826140046074014" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>@RoCatchers</u></a> said. “These games feature inappropriate animations disguised as innocent stuff, and people within the games use it for lewd acts. These games also feature private ‘motel rooms’ that you can lock allowing people to be 1 on 1. These games are often a target for predators.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The creator, whose seemingly harmless light-blue teddy bear avatar has filled social media feeds, is responsible for publishing popular titles like Boys and Girls Club Hangout Roleplay and CNP and Slender Hangout, both of which have since been removed from Roblox’s list of publicly available experiences. Suggestive content is believed to be the cause behind previous bans and content takedowns from Roblox Corporation, but despite <a href="https://x.com/greenlegocats/status/1930331026708148521" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>numerous reports of action taken against TheOfficiaITeddy in the past</u></a>, players found that the creator has managed to find his way back to the Roblox spotlight on more than one occasion.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">but for whatever reason, he was UNBANNED, and he directly claimed that he received an invite to RDC. Then, Roblox bans him again, and very very recently Roblox UNBANNED him- <a href="https://t.co/OLbxDae3Xx" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/OLbxDae3Xx</a></p>— RoCatchers (@RoCatchers) <a href="https://twitter.com/RoCatchers/status/1934826146182647855?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">While most Roblox developers invited to participate in The Hatch include names behind popular obstacle courses and action-focused experiences, TheOfficiaITeddy stood out to many as a concerning outlier who has been repeatedly accused of harming the safety of users on the platform. <a href="https://x.com/Roblox/status/1935815895622074644" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Roblox’s confirmation</u></a> that Teddy was, along with many others, invited to be officially involved in The Hatch only added fuel to the fire, with his official backing now sitting at the forefront of the issues the #BoycottTheHatch movement seeks to resolve.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is #BoycottTheHatch?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The #BoycottTheHatch movement’s sails first caught wind with posts from X users like <a href="https://x.com/RoCatchers/status/1934826134476087759" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>@RoCatchers</u></a> and <a href="https://x.com/greenlegocats/status/1934813018392809869" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>@greenlegocats</u></a> in mid-June. The goal was clear: spread awareness. Posts covering the topic quickly gained thousands of likes on X alone as users called not only for Teddy’s invitation to be rescinded but for the controversial creator to be banned altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What was a simmer quickly evolved into a full-on boil as Roblox developers involved in The Hatch began to pull out from the event. Popular creations like <a href="https://x.com/DoorsRoblox/status/1935149565574795323" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DOORS</u></a>, <a href="https://x.com/UrbanshadeRblx/status/1935126720992133536" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Pressure</u></a>, <a href="https://x.com/DaRealMiniToon/status/1935128882451202152" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Piggy</u></a>, untitled tag game, <a href="https://x.com/Rawblocky/status/1935136493376516285" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>LOCOfficial</u></a>, and many more stepped away not only due to the issues surrounding TheOfficiaITeddy but because of issues regarding how The Hatch has been handled thus far. These include general quality concerns as well as other points of contention such as fears some The Hatch promotional images were generated by artificial intelligence and a concern regarding how developers were selected for participation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A few days removed from the boycott’s emergence (and weeks before The Hatch would kick off), <a href="https://x.com/Roblox/status/1935815895622074644" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Roblox addressed the Teddy situation</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The safety and well-being of the Roblox community is our top priority,” Roblox said. “On top of our community standards, we have additional guidelines to qualify to participate in platform events. TheOfficiaITeddy should not have been invited; we have rescinded their invitation to The Hatch and have taken appropriate action in accordance with our policies. Our team is thoroughly re-examining the invitation list against our community standards and are re-evaluating these processes to ensure an additional level of vetting for our invitees going forward.”</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We appreciate their removal from the event, but I please ask that the moderation team reviews their account accordingly. If their game doesn't follow your guidelines, surely their account doesn't either. I want this platform to be a safer place, I know you guys can do better</p>— MiniToon (@DaRealMiniToon) <a href="https://twitter.com/DaRealMiniToon/status/1935821652417237418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Piggy developer MiniToon was one of the <a href="https://x.com/DaRealMiniToon/status/1935821652417237418" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>first to respond</u></a> to Roblox Corporation’s message, explaining that while the sentiment was appreciated, it remained worried that the moderation team would not thoroughly address the situation. It added in a post: “I don't want to have to make these tweets, but it feels like we are just being seen and not heard, witnessed and not understood.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the #BoycottTheHatch hashtag continued to fill feeds in the weeks that followed, Roblox finally returned with <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/06/update-on-the-investigation-of-theofficialteddy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a lengthy statement</u></a> June 30, two days before The Hatch would begin. The company explained that, during its absence, it conducted an investigation into Teddy that involved an attempt to alter experiences that complied with its <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Standards" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Community Standards</u></a>. Although these standards were eventually met, Roblox said it was able to confirm “a separate outstanding policy violation that cannot be rectified.” Teddy and all of his creations have since been removed from the platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At Roblox, safety is foundational to everything we do — that’s why we take reports of harmful content or behavior seriously, and we investigate them thoroughly,” Roblox said. “It can take time to investigate properly, and we’re always working to make this process more efficient while maintaining our high standards for fairness.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Teddy may be banned but we still have a lot of work to do in the fight against online dating, degeneracy, and pedatory behavior on Roblox. This has been a big victory in an even bigger battle. Continue fighting the good fight to make Roblox a safer space for all.</p>— Lord CowCow (@greenlegocats) <a href="https://twitter.com/greenlegocats/status/1939908057926107494?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">There’s been no word regarding how the #BoycottTheHatch movement may pivott to address other common complains, but Teddy’s removal stands as a major moment for the movement. For now, the event is scheduled to run for another nine days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox The Hatch launched July 2 and, at the time of this piece’s publication, sports more than 40K likes and more than 97K dislikes. As players continue to shape their experiences in the coming days, you can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robloxs-grow-a-garden-towers-above-even-the-biggest-steam-games-but-you-probably-have-no-idea-what-it-is"><u>read up on Grow a Garden</u></a>, which has catapulted itself past multiple concurrent player records in its journey to become one of the most popular games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
