Players were combining this with ability-stacking and the Stendahl skill, which deals extreme single target Void damage, to dish out billions of damage, enough to kill the final boss in just one hit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was underwhelming for most of development, so in our final pre-release balance pass, we gave it a big damage boost — and clearly overdid it. It ended up overshadowing most other options,” Sandfall said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We still want you to be able to break the game — and you absolutely still can — but Stendhal was making it a bit too easy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The nerf is included in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s first full hotfix set. While Stendhal is still a strong single-hit skill with great synergy potential, it’s now more in-line with everything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the patch fixes what sounds like a bug that was making Medalum third Lumina doubling all damage in Virtuose Stance, instead of doubling only Burn damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the relevant points from today's patch notes:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed Medalum third Lumina doubling all damage in Virtuose Stance instead of doubling only Burn damage.</li><li>Stendhal: Reduced damage by 40%.</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Maelle Outfits and Haircuts - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur is a breakout hit for Sandfall, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-2-million-copies-sold-after-12-days-on-sale">and has already sold over 2 million copies</a>. It’s worth remembering that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was, alongside Bethesda’s Oblivion Remastered, a day-one Game Pass title. That makes this sales milestone all the more impressive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Bethesda shadow-dropped <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered"><u>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</u></a> amid the launch of fellow role-playing game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, most thought there could be only one winner. However, it turned out that there was plenty of room for both games to succeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has done so well that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/french-president-macron-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-for-creating-one-of-the-best-rated-games-in-history"><u>French President Macron has praised the development team</u></a>.
