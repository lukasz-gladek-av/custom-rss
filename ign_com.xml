The grind for experience points (XP) and ‘prestige’ (resetting progress and leveling up all over again after hitting 55) is part of the Call of Duty experience, and for many is the driving motivation to play for months, sometimes years on end. But a player already hitting the maximum possible level, with Black Ops 6 little over a month old, was thought impossible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's because of the astronomical amount of XP required to hit level 1,000 (approx 50 million XP). Once you Prestige 10 times you can graduate to become a Prestige Master, which unlocks an extra 1,000 levels to grind. Hitting level 1,000 Prestige Master is the end point of the entire Black Ops 6 grind, and brings with it a set of exclusive rewards that were unknown to the community, until now.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">1000 Unlocked <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cod?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#cod</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nukesquad?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#nukesquad</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mogged?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#mogged</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CallofDuty?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#CallofDuty</a> <a href="https://t.co/JPIAXDbU3O" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/JPIAXDbU3O</a></p>— Beamishh (@Beamishhhhhhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/Beamishhhhhhh/status/1863315265523499422?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The player in question created an X / Twitter account to discuss what they had achieved, and even published a <a href="https://streamable.com/dxwbjk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> showing off the rewards. The X / Twitter user, called ‘Beamishh,’ subsequently admitted to using “Zombies glitches,” to hit level 1,000 already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since Black Ops 6’s release players have used the PvE Zombies mode to farm XP because it's much quicker than playing Multiplayer or Warzone (XP progress is shared across all three experiences). And within Zombies mode, various away from keyboard (AFK) glitches and exploits have been discovered that let players leave their console or PC running as their character obtains XP from infinite waves of zombie enemies. And that’s exactly what Aldredd / Beamishh did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why is this a problem? Some Black Ops 6 players were racing to become the first to hit Prestige Master level 1,000 and thus reveal the rewards themselves. Indeed, entire groups of players were working together to reveal the rewards first through legitimate play. One such group, called Nuke Squad, is made up of Call of Duty streamers who are sharing their accounts in order to hit the coveted milestone, but are now complaining about Beamishh getting there first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One member of Nuke Squad, called Santana, <a href="https://x.com/TheBoiSantana/status/1863332192019157224" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to say they were “robbed.” “So saddening to see zombie exploiters ruin the level 1,000 rewards,” they said. “Nuke Squad has streamed every single game since the game released and for it to be robbed and posted all over social media is so disheartening. It’s also sad that the company didn’t really do anything about these exploiters even though we all knew what was going on in the background. GGs.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Santana’s tweet has itself fueled the row, with some in the community pointing out that while Beamishh used Zombies glitches to hit level 1,000, Nuke Squad were trying to hit the same milestone by account sharing, which violates Call of Duty’s terms of service.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Santana <a href="https://x.com/TheBoiSantana/status/1863356600284742088" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replied</a> to this suggestion by claiming that Call of Duty publisher Activision had told Nuke Squad that its members were allowed to account share for the race, but were restricted to no more than six people, and no more than eight hours for each person playing. This itself has caused some to wonder why an exception was made for Call of Duty streamers and content creators, leaving regular players with a disadvantage or facing a potential ban for employing the same tactic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The row shows no sign of stopping either, with both Beamishh and Santana continuing to have their say online. Beamishh <a href="https://x.com/Beamishhhhhhh/status/1863377291515936833" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">denied</a> cheating (“I’m just doing zombies glitches mate idk why you’re so tilted”) but <a href="https://x.com/Beamishhhhhhh/status/1863344500426330397" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted</a> “there’s nothing impressive about my 1,000.” Santana has <a href="https://x.com/TheBoiSantana/status/1862530908609552688" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested</a> Zombies AFK exploiters could get banned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Prestige Master Level 1,000 spoilers follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the rewards, some are saying they tease the next Call of Duty game, which is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-reportedly-a-black-ops-2-sequel-set-around-2030">reportedly a Black Ops 2 sequel set around 2030</a>. They include a skin for Operator Eric Samuels, a Secret Service agent from Black Ops 2. The skin is called 'New Orders' and looks like it includes future tech. The weapon blueprint is called Enigma Tech, and includes the following description: "Get a glimpse of the day after tomorrow with the Enigma Tech Weapon Blueprint."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1863358638577889766?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The speculation now is that Activision and Black Ops developer Treyarch had hoped it would take at least half a year for players to hit Prestige Master Level 1,000, around about the time it planned to pull back the curtain on next year’s Call of Duty. Samuels, it seems, will play a role in that game. All this will make sense in time, but for Activision, perhaps, this particular breadcrumb was discovered sooner than expected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking on Zombies mode?

Especially when it comes to first-party Nintendo titles like Zelda and Mario, you often see games sticking with an above $40 price tag years and years after their release. That's why this deals season, the number one thing I had my eye on was price drops on Switch games, and for the first time (maybe ever), Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals have exceeded my expectations. While the Nintendo eShop has its own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-black-friday-digital-video-game-sale-live">digital game sale</a> underway, some of the best Switch games have their lowest prices ever at select retailers like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-black-friday-sales-2024">Best Buy</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamestop-black-friday-sale-2024">GameStop</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-target-black-friday-sales">Target</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-walmart-black-friday-deals-2024">Walmart</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With major price cuts to games that typically cost upwards of $50 (looking at you, Zelda), these <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cyber-monday-deals-2024">Cyber Monday deals</a> aren't getting any better.
