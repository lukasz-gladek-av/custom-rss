It was very close, very close. But I'm still here," Johnson said. "I'm still here because my wife decided to call the hotel where I was staying, doing announcing for the Alzheimer's Association, and had my son call security, and find out I was nearly dead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They took me to the hospital, put me in a coma. I was in there for five days before I found out that my wonderful friends Bill Glasser and Shari Elliker and Kim had put together this GoFundMe, where I found out there's a lot of love in this world that I didn't know was out there and I'm grateful to each and every one of you."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Johnson thanked the National Alzheimer's Association for flying his family down to see him and putting them in hotels, thanked the chairman of the Washington Capitals parent company Ted Leonsis for donating $25,000, and he thanked Glasser and Elliker.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Johnson also thanked Bethesda, who posted on social media to show support after news broke of his illness. "You say that I'm your friend. I am," he said. "Always will be. Love you guys." He then thanked fans, both those who've donated and those who've showed support otherwise. "I love you all. I'm not going anywhere," Johnson said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's going to be a while as I work my way back but I'm coming back. I look forward to seeing and having you all hear me then.
