IGN's Game Help team has put together a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight"><strong>Hollow Knight wiki</strong></a>, including a walkthrough, boss guides, collectible locations, and more, so you're one step ahead on your adventure through the Hallownest.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Essential Hollow Knight Guides</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you're playing Hollow Knight for the first time or looking to brush up on your Metroidvania skills <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight/Should_You_Play_Hollow_Knight_Before_Silksong%3F"><strong>before Hollow Knight: Silksong releases</strong></a> on September 4, 2025, we have plenty of guides to assist you as you explore the game's deep, dark depths.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Full Hollow Knight Walkthrough</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/25/hollow-knight-false-knight-1756134825211.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're unsure where to go next, our Hollow Knight walkthrough is here to help you out. While you can technically visit any location in any order, we recommend using our progression guide if you prefer a structured approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our walkthrough points out collectibles as they appear, so there's no need to go back to an area to do cleanup. It also features checkmarks so you can check off your progress as you go and keep track of where you're at with collectibles, optional bosses, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can find <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight/walkthrough"><strong>our Hollow Knight Walkthrough here</strong></a>.

Arguably the most important is Mask Shards, which increase The Knight's health pool, allowing you to take more hits. There are 16 Mask Shards, the locations of which you can track in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight/All_Mask_Shards_in_Hollow_Knight_-_Locations_Guide"><strong>our All Mask Shards in Hollow Knight - Locations Guide</strong></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vessel Fragments are equally as valuable, increasing your available Soul and therefore allowing you to cast more Spells and heal more before your Soul Meter runs out. There are nine Vessel Fragments to find - use <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight/Vessel_Fragments"><strong>our Vessel Fragments guide</strong></a> to track them down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Charms are used to add additional effects to The Knight, giving you an advantage against Hollow Knight's many tough foes. They can be tricky to hunt down if you don't know where to look. Visit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight/Charms"><strong>our Charms guide,</strong></a> which includes the exact location of all 45 Charms, and use our handy checklists to track your progress toward collecting them all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Charms, you'll need to collect Grubs to get two of them. Grubs are scattered throughout the depths, held captive in glass jars. As you find and release them, the Grubfather will reward you with a large handful of useful items, including a Mask Shard, Pale Ore, and as mentioned, Charms. Head to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight/All_46_Grub_Locations"><strong>our All 46 Grub Locations guide</strong></a> for help rescuing them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight/Collectibles"><strong>our Collectibles page</strong></a> for the full list of our Hollow Knight Collectibles guides.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hollow Knight Items, Equipment, and Upgrades</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/25/hollow-knight-upgrades-1756135091849.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As you make your way through the Hallownest, you'll unlock various upgrades, including Abilities, Spells, and improved Nails. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight/Items,_Equipment,_and_Upgrades"><strong>Our Items, Equipment, and Upgrades guide</strong></a> tracks them all in one place so you know exactly where to go to unlock The Knight's next upgrade. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also lists Quest Items, many of which are used to progress side quests, so if you're someone who likes to stray off the main path and complete optional content, this will be of help to you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Meg Koepp is a Guides Editor on the IGN Guides team, with a focus on trends.
