There will even be a new variant as an Anzellan (like Babu Frik!) named Otto will sometimes appear on a BDX that needs a little tune up.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/08/thnd-027165-1741465237775.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Disney</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and if that wasn't enough BDX goodness for you, the team shared these droids will be making an appearance in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Here's a Sneak Peak at the Load Area and Lift Off of the New Monsters, Inc. Attraction at Disney World</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monsters-inc-land-is-coming-to-disney-hollywood-studios-d23-2024">Monsters, Inc. Land is coming soon to Disney World's Hollywood Studios</a> and it will include an exciting new themed roller coaster that will be Disney Park's first-ever suspended coaster and <a href="https://disneyparksblog.com/wdw/sxsw-2025-monsters-coaster-hollywood-studios/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its first with a vertical lift.</a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new attraction aims to give guests the dream-come-true moment of soaring through Monsters, Inc.'s door vault and Disney shared a first look at the load area and how it should set the tone very well of what's to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We still have much to learn about this new attraction and the land it will live in, but this is an exciting tease nonetheless.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pixar and Imagineering Reveal a New Type of Ride Vehicle Had to Be Made for Magic Kingdom's Upcoming Cars Attraction</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Pixar Chief Creative Officer Pete Docter and Imagineer Michael Hundgen shared <a href="https://disneyparksblog.com/wdw/sxsw-2025-cars-ride-vehicles-disney-world/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new details about the upcoming Cars attraction</a> that will be part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cars-is-getting-two-new-attractions-at-disney-worlds-magic-kingdom-that-arent-in-radiator-springs-d23-2024">the new Cars-themed land</a> that is currently in development at Magic Kingdom. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our primary goal is creating an emotional experience for our guests,” Hundgen said. “For this <em>Cars</em> attraction, we need to invent a new type of ride vehicle. No one builds these in a factory because it has to do so much more than just carrying you from one place to another. We have to create a car that conveys a feeling when you ride in it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team needed some real-world data to help in their research so they went to the Arizona desert to ride in an off-road vehicle and take off over rocky terrain. This new ride doesn't take place in Radiator Springs, but instead it will be a thrilling rally race through the mountains, so they want it to feel just right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From there, they worked with a motocross company to build a dirt track of their own to race around and used that to develop what will eventually be the ride vehicle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’re using a customized production vehicle,” Hundgen continued. “It has sensors all over it, and we’re taking it for test drives on our dirt track to gather data on how the vehicle responds to different terrain. This is where we turn that feeling we want into real-world engineering."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These vehicles will also get some Disney and Pixar magic thrown in as each car will have its own personality, name, and number.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/08/cars-1741464991876.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Disney</figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Robert Downey Jr. Stops by Disney's SXSW Panel to Help Share More About the New Avengers Campus Attractions</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/08/rdj-20241219-071-v3-2048x1365-1741465033594.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Disney</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Disneyland's Avengers Campus is getting two new attractions, including one called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disneylands-avengers-attraction-is-officially-called-avengers-infinity-defense-d23-2024">Avengers Infinity Defense</a> where guests will team up with members of the Avengers to take on King Thanos across multiple worlds. However, the second one was the star of Disney's SXSW panel as <a href="https://disneyparksblog.com/dlr/sxsw-2025-robert-downey-jr-tony-stark-avengers-campus/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Downey Jr. himself stopped by to share new details about it.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been previously revealed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robert-downey-jr-to-become-tony-stark-again-for-a-new-disneyland-attraction-in-avengers-campus-d23-2024">Downey Jr. would be returning as Tony Stark for Avengers Campus' Stark Flight Lab,</a> an attraction that will take guests into Tony's workshop and allow them to experience some of the new tech he's been working on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Downey Jr. said these new experiences are "the living embodiment of the Stark Enterprises mission statement."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The curiosity, the passion, the inventiveness, the occasional flair for the dramatic, most of all a drive to put something good out into the world to make life better, at the minimum more fun by a mile, ” Downey continued. “It’s the privilege of a lifetime to be invited to participate.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the ride itself, guests will sit in "gyro-kinetic pods" and will eventually be grabbed by a giant robot arm who will help them make "several high-speed maneuvers inspired by Iron Man and some other Avengers."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Transferring from a track to a robot arm and then back again – nothing like this has ever been done before in a theme park, and we’re so excited about it,” Chief Creative Officer for Walt Disney Imagineering Bruce Vaughn explained. “Usually, we hide all the tech behind the scenes so you can focus on the story. Here, the tech IS the story, so we’re putting it front and center.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of they ways Imagineering is making the tech the star of this attraction is the focus on that robotic arm, which actually takes heavy inspiration from Tony Stark's little robotic friend, DUM-E. The team enlisted the help of dancers and motion capture to help make these robots feel as real as possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from the world of Disney, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cinderella-at-75-the-princess-and-glass-slippers-that-saved-disney">our 75th Anniversary Retrospective for Cinderella,</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disneyland-70th-anniversary-celebrations-announced-for-2025-and-beyond-celebrate-happy">how Disneyland will be celebrating its 70th anniversary,</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-announced-at-the-disney-experiences-showcase-d23-2024">everything else announced at D23's big Disney Experiences Showcase.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Have a tip for us?
