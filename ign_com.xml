Games boss David Haddad is set to leave the company, according to a new report.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> said Haddad will leave his role as president of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment after 12 years of leading Warner Bros. Games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company has had a troubled 12 months, first with the catastrophic release of Rocksteady’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, then the disappointing release of Smash Bros.-style brawler <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. Discovery has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s failure contributed to a $200 million hit to its business</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business">MultiVersus added another $100 million on top</a>. Warner Bros. Games' only new game release during the third quarter of 2024 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions"><u>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</u></a>, which failed to make an impression.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking in a financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav said: "We recognise [the games business] is substantially underperforming its potential right now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League post-launch content has come to an end with the delivery of its year one roadmap. Warner Bros. has yet to announce Rocksteady’s next game, but it is reportedly helping out on a director’s cut of Hogwarts Legacy. The legendary British studio has suffered a number of layoffs in recent months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also question marks over Mortal Kombat 1’s financial performance, although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-chief-ed-boon-teases-t-1000-fatality-and-future-dlc">NetherRealm chief Ed Boon recently announced over five million sales and teased future DLC following the release of the T-1000 Terminator guest character</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Zaslav said Warner Bros. was doubling down on four games: Hogwarts Legacy (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-2-coordinating-big-picture-storytelling-with-harry-potter-tv-show-storylines"><u>a sequel is already in the works</u></a>), Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC, "in particular Batman." Warner Bros. recently published VR game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/batman-arkham-shadow"><u>Batman: Arkham Shadow</u></a> exclusively on the Meta Quest 3, and has a Wonder Woman game in the works at Monolith Productions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are focusing our development efforts on those core franchises, with proven studios to improve our success ratio," Zaslav added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Variety, Haddad will stay on with Warner Bros. discovery for the next three months as the company looks for his replacement during an apparent quieter release schedule.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
