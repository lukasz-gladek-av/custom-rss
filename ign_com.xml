It's called Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD, and it's coming to the console at launch on June 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Bravely series of RPGs was begun as a spin-off of sorts of Final Fantasy back in the 3DS era, with Bravely Default: Flying Fairy being the first in the series. The games feature a unique battle mechanic where players can either opt to "Default" or defend, and store energy to then "Brave" and make multiple moves in a single turn.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bravely Default making a return is a big deal, as both Bravely Default and Bravely Second, its direct sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bravely-default-3ds-games-shutting-down-online-features-soon">had their online city-building features shut down</a> in 2023. This version appears to bring back the online features in some fashion, alongside "upgraded features and enhancements" and a number of new minigames. The exact nature of these upgrades is still up in the air, so we'll have to wait to find out exactly how much is different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch already has one Bravely game, Bravely Default 2 (not to be confused with the aforementioned Bravely Second), which came out in 2022 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bravely-default-2-review">which we gave an 8/10</a>, calling it "a long, familiar JRPG journey with excellent customizable combat and beautiful backdrops that pass the time as you work through its extended stretches of grinding."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at the Nintendo Direct today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It’s far from a release date and could absolutely be pushed, but for now, it’s the most promising update for Hollow Knight: Silksong we’ve gotten in years.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally confirmed for just Nintendo Switch and PC, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-trailer"><u>Xbox (and Game Pass)</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-ps4-and-ps5"><u>PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5</u></a> versions being added later, Team Cherry has been slowly ramping up the conversation around Silksong after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-hollow-knight-silksong-news-at-e3-2021"><u>going quiet for a long time</u></a>. It was announced a whopping six years ago almost to the day, and outside of the occasional pop-up, it has laid dormant since. The studio behind the Hollow Knight follow-up did promise that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-release-window-next-12-months"><u>launch would soon arrive back in 2022</u></a>, but as the months came and went, hope began to dwindle that Hollow Knight: Silksong would ever arrive - until recently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Cherry kicked off 2025 with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake">a mysterious tease related to a chocolate cake recipe</a>, leading desperate fans to hope that a re-reveal would arrive in April. Of course, we now know that, somehow, the riddle-solving Hollow Knight fans were right to expect a reveal alongside the Switch 2 Direct. Although today’s 2025 release window promise offered little in terms of actually showing what the game has to offer, it’s at least something to mark on your calendars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Time will tell if Team Cherry will finally be able to nail down a Hollow Knight: Silksong release date before the year is out. In the meantime, you can see everything else announced during today’s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

Over on the official Nintendo store, the company is implementing some pre-order measures to ensure bona fide Switch players are getting their pre-orders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My Nintendo Store</a>, those with a Nintendo Account can register their interest in pre-ordering a Nintendo Switch 2 system and "select accessories" from the Nintendo Store. Those who express interest will then get an invitation email once their turn in line comes up, valid for 72 hours. The catch? You'll need to have put in some time on your old Switch, and been a Switch Online member.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Invitation emails will be prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis to registrants who have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership with a minimum of 12 months of paid membership and a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours, as of April 2, 2025," according to the fine print on the site.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo also notes that invitations are "non-transferable" and will be sent to email addresses associated with the Nintendo Account that registers interest. For the system and each accessory, there will also be a one-per-account limit during the invitation period. Currently on the site, you can express interest in either a base Nintendo Switch 2 system, or the one bundled with Mario Kart World.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Orders will be shipped after purchase, and the approximate shipping date will be provided when ordering. Nintendo also specifies: "Please note that release-day delivery is not guaranteed due to processing and shipment times."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While not said outright by Nintendo, all of these measures seem dedicated towards ensuring that someone buying a Switch 2 through this process is someone who wants to purchase and play a Switch 2 for themselves, rather than flip it online.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 Console Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Scalping has been a frequent problem for new releases of sought-after products. Notably, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bots-scalpers-ruining-chances-of-getting-ps5-xbox-series-x-nintendo-switch-oled">scalpers pursuing the new hardware</a>, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-destined-rivals-launch-ran-into-the-same-old-issues-with-scalpers-shortages-and-outages">been dealing with ongoing scalping and shortages</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve found some success in its queue system for the Steam Deck, utilizing a method that tied Steam accounts to purchases alongside checks for whether an account was made before, or after, a certain window. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/opinion-steam-deck-queue-system-fight-scalpers">It worked</a>, and it's not surprising now to see Nintendo taking similar measures with the My Nintendo Store process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, there will be other ways to pick up a Switch 2. But hopefully options like this can help some long-time Switch 1 owners avoid the potential chaos of locking down a launch day Switch 2 pre-order.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Surprisingly, though, it's not a pack-in piece of software, but a separate, paid digital game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shown during today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, the Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour is a "virtual exhibition" of the new hardware. Per Nintendo, "through tech demos, minigames and other interactions, players will get to know the new system inside and out in ways they may never have known about otherwise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's Direct showed footage of a small player avatar exploring a super-sized Switch 2, reading about the different features and facts about the Nintendo Switch 2. It seems to act like a virtual museum of sorts, but also have some min-games like Speed Golf, Dodge the Spiked Balls, and a Maracas Physics Demo.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On stream and in a press release, Nintendo also confirmed the Switch 2 Welcome Tour will be available to buy from the Nintendo eShop on Switch 2's launch day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's a neat tool, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3llti45h2s22a" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans were quick to wonder why</a> this was a paid digital-only game and not a console pack-in for the Nintendo Switch 2. No price has been listed as of this writing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For comparison, the Switch 2 is also launching with games like Mario Kart World, Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster, and Deltarune Chapters 1 through 4.

It's vampire-themed, but somehow it's not Bloodborne 2. It's called The Duskbloods, and it's coming in 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 - The Dusk Bloods</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer opens with a man slumped on a chair, asleep or perhaps dead. A woman's hand reaches up to his dangling one from the floor, while a woman's voiceover says, "I give you my blood. I give you my life. Turn a wheel, and transport him to a night of moonlight, to humanity's very dusk." As she withdraws her hand, she leaves a symbol carved on the back of his.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the trailer showcases a dark, gothic world: chapels, railroads, towering buildings, dim lighting, cemetaries, bats, enormous statues, and a host of very FromSoftware enemies. At one point, a character flies around with a jetpack. There's a big, creepy moon. We see melodramatic swords, guns, and other weapons used as well as magic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your character, the guy in the opening, appears to be a vampire, as there's a moment where he bites into the neck of an enemy and absolutely menaces it. It also looks like you'll be able to play in co-op in some form, as we see another person summoned alongside the player and seemingly about to fight with them. FromSoftware itself took to social media to announce that Duskbloods is a "PvPvE-focused multiplayer action title."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We are pleased to announce "The Duskbloods" - a PvPvEfocused multiplayer action title for the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2. Release is currently planned for 2026. We hope you look forward to it. <a href="https://t.co/aAVXeuDrVI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/aAVXeuDrVI</a></p>— FROMSOFTWARE (@fromsoftware_pr) <a href="https://twitter.com/fromsoftware_pr/status/1907442980665143744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Essentially, this looks like the Bloodborne sequel everyone's been asking for, but it's not named Bloodborne. That's likely because Bloodborne is owned by Sony, which hasn't seemed interested in doing any kind of follow-up to the game despite high fan demand. The Duskbloods appears to be FromSoftware's answer to that fan demand, and Nintendo Switch 2 players get the benefit of it. And it looks like FromSoftware is going all-in on Switch 2 support, as it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nintendo-switc-2">also bringing Elden Ring to the platform</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave Bloodborne itself <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review">a 9.1/10 at launch</a>, saying it "delivers an exhausting and exhilerating journey into the depths of madness."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at the Nintendo Direct today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

During today's Nintendo Direct, we learned that Koei Tecmo is making a new Hyrule Warriors game: a Tears of the Kingdom prequel called Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment. And it's coming out this winter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is another Hyrule Warriors game, but this time starring the cast of characters present in the ancient history portions of Tears of the Kingdom. That means Zelda, of course, as well as Rauru, Sonia, and the other holders of the Secret Stones. It tells the story of what Zelda was doing during the events of Tears of the Kingdom after she traveled back in time, in which she joined forces with the last remaining Zonai, Rauru, his sister Mineru, and his wife Sonia, to fight against Ganondorf and his forces.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 - Hyrule Warriors Age of Imprisonment</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer gave us a look at some of the abilities of all these champions, including Mineru in her mech, Zelda's magic, Rauru with a cool sword-spear thing, and a quick glimpse of the other Sacred Stone wielders as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This will be the third Hyrule Warriors game, following the original Hyrule Warriors and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, which similarly told a prequel story to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Age of Calamity was especially interesting, as if you knew the story of Breath of the Wild, Age of Calamity told its part in a sliiiightly unexpected way, so it will be interesting to see if Age of Imprisonment similarly goes off the rails. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review">gave Age of Calamity a 9/10</a>, calling it "a joy to play and discover" and "a blast from start to finish."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at the Nintendo Direct today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
