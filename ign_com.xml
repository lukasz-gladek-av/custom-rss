            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Girls’ Frontline 2: Exilium is celebrating its first anniversary, introducing a major update with brand-new Crew Deck gameplay. Now there are more ways than ever to interact with your T-Dolls, with exclusive animations and story content for nearly 40 characters. Each Doll has unique behaviors that come out as you spend more time with them, and there are interaction scenes between certain Dolls when they show up together.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>New Features Land in Crew Deck Upgrade </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Crew Deck open, Commanders will find fully realized 3D versions of the collectible cabinet and armory in addition to the new interactive story moments. Commanders should have received mail with an item that lets them unlock the interactive story scene for the hard-eyed but soft-hearted sniper, Makiatto. The story scene "Time Capsule - Pulse-Racing Night" will be available for free. If you already have Makiatto's Outfit ("Embroidered Bamboo, Blooming Shadows"), you'll be able to experience Makiatto's scene after unlocking the relevant area. You'll also be able to get 35 Outfit Access Permissions at no charge through upgrade rewards, mail rewards, and other limited-time events.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An interactive story scene is available for the elite Doll Klukai alongside the release of her new "Cerulean Breaker" outfit, which gives you the unlock item "Time Capsule - Body Maintenance Technician." For a limited time, you will also be able to make exchanges for more Outfit Access Permissions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Klukai, she's the highlight of the Crew Deck's new Holography Function. You can collect 3D trinkets, customize your living space, cook, play minigames in the Crimson Arcade, and lots more. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Anniversary Rewards Overflowing</strong> </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">'Tis all about giving during the Starry Season, and developer Mica Team has tons of limited-time event rewards to put on GFL2’s plate for its first-year anniversary celebration. By joining in, players can earn more than 130 pulls and more than 13,000 Collapse Pieces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Crew Deck Date Reward includes 10 Access Permissions, an Elmo Model ornament, 300 Collapse Pieces, and more growth materials. The season also delivers two free outfits: Dragon Chef for Qiuhua from the Glory Store and Enjoy the Fragrance for Springfield are unlocked for free once your collectibles reach the required level. Additional Access Permissions can be earned from daily activities, furniture exchanges, gift packs, mail rewards, and the seasonal Battle Pass event. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Check out the Video of 404 Squad, with More to Come</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Commanders can look forward to meeting two new Dolls, Leva and Lenna. These additions from the original 404 Squad use electricity to attack and debuff their foes, and they're sure to give Electric teams a boost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check in with <a href="https://gf2exilium.sunborngame.com/main" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">GFL2's main site</a> and social media (Including <a href="https://x.com/GFL2EXILIUM_EN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GFL2EXILIUM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">YouTube</a>) for more information about the timing of prize drops, stay up-to-date on upcoming collabs with other games and franchises, and to see a new trailer that reunites the 404 Squad when Lenna, Leva, Klukai, and Mechty are reunited under the Commander to carry out a dangerous mission. There are intense battles with gatling guns, helicopters, humvees, and other heavy machinery. Commanders and their Dolls should expect to stay busy for quite a while, but don't forget to relax on the Crew Deck from time to time. That's what it's for.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/girls-frontline-2-exilium-unveils-the-overhauled-crew-deck-and-anniversary-rewards]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios are preparing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> players for Season 1: Winter Offensive with a community letter with a list of changes set to be introduced with the upcoming 1.1.3.0 update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The message, which aims to roll out the welcome mat for what will be yet another feedback-driven update, was <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-incoming-winter-offensive" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted on the official Battlefield 6 website</u></a> today. It comes with a breakdown for some of the community talking points BF Studios has attempted to address so far, while giving fans a closer look at what’s to come when Winter Offensive launches December 9.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-anticheat-update-season-1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anticheat</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-quickly-fixes-defibrillators-after-support-players-report-strict-revive-requirements">challenge/progression</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-surprise-update-addresses-escalation-feedback-with-increased-objective-capture-time">Escalation</a> updates topping the list of recent highlights, BF Studios is turning its attention to a number of key issues across combat, REDSEC, and the overall Battlefield 6 experience. One especially troublesome issue for the community that the team is seeking to fix with update 1.1.3.0 are audio issues that have existed since launch. Players should notice, for example, that footsteps have been tweaked to “improve clarity, distance definition, and positional awareness across the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have also continued to work on performance and memory issues that could cause sounds,” BF Studios says, “such as vehicles or footsteps, to sometimes not play as intended, which has been particularly noticeable on larger Battle Royale maps.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following last month’s multiplayer mode tweaks is a set of additional adjustments for Rush and Breakthrough. The studio explains the new changes as another step in the balancing act that has seen it attempting to keep matches fair, with the new update ideally improving the experience for attacking players.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capture volumes and vehicle availability in Breakthrough will also be updated when 1.1.3.0 launches next week, with BF Studios explaining that Siege of Cairo, for example, will feature an additional attacker tank for Sectors 1 and 3 and a reworked capture area for objective B. Rush fans will notice M-COM locations for Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak have been adjusted to further refine attacker gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These updates are intended to reduce bottlenecks, remove frustration points, and create more consistent and engaging fights around objectives,” BF Studios says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Beyond these highlights, we have also made a range of quality-of-life improvements across UI clarity, minimap behavior, controller aiming responsiveness, and more, which you will see detailed in the full notes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another topic plaguing the Battlefield 6 fanbase since launch involves potential hit registration and netcode issues. It’s an area BF Studios has taken aim at before, with update 1.1.3.0 set to, hopefully, buff out even more scratches related to inconsistent gameplay across multiplayer and REDSEC. Also included in the new changes is the promise that Battlefield 6 will be easier on the eyes thanks to changes to close-range soldier visibility, lighting, prone animations, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While players across the experience will likely pick up on “wide-ranging” changes to weapon handling, attachments, and recoil patterns, REDSEC fans can look forward to armor and tank availability changes. Armor changes for the battle royale experience will be detailed in its own dedicated post in the near future, with tank changes also subject to change as fans get their hands on update 1.1.3.0.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are actively exploring several areas aimed at improving clarity, responsiveness, and fairness in combat, BF Studios adds. “This includes further work on edge cases related to hit registration, investigating rare desync scenarios with destructible objects, and gathering deeper data on situations where players feel they were eliminated after reaching cover. These areas remain key priorities, and the findings from our ongoing investigations will inform updates planned for the new year.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This latest communication from the Battlefield team stops short of providing full Battlefield 6 update 1.1.3.0 patch notes. Players are told to expect a more detailed list of all of the new weapon, map, and mode changes in “the next few days.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 Season 1 will deliver its third and final chapter when Winter Offensive launches December 9 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S. While the two previous chapters have introduced additional weapons, modes, and two maps – Blackwell Fields and Eastwood – next week’s content update focuses on its Ice Lock event changes. Expect snowy limited-time goodies for Gauntlet and Empire State, as well as an ice climbing axe melee weapon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched for PC and consoles October 10. As BF Studios <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-1120-patch-notes-include-aim-assist-tweaks-and-bloom-adjustments-as-season-1-continues"><u>continues to refine its gameplay</u></a>, players have found themselves divided over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-is-brilliant-battlefield-6-players-flock-to-giant-fan-made-conquest-maps-as-map-size-debate-rages-on"><u>map sizes</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rascals-battlefield-6-players-torn-as-323-pack-puts-a-high-price-on-grounded-skins"><u>goofy skins</u></a> while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-just-had-the-best-month-of-sales-in-the-us-of-any-game-in-the-last-three-years"><u>EA boasts record-breaking launch sales</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.
