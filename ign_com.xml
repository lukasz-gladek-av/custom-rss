With availability at major retailers like Best Buy, now’s the time to snag one before they sell out. There's also the Xbox Sky Cipher controller, down to just $49.99 at Amazon today as well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Xbox Expansion Card SSD Deals</h2><div catalogid="3b564ab7-613c-44c9-8d1b-734908cb3e7e" id="188326"><div id="188326" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>WD C50 1TB Expansion Card For Xbox Series XS</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Is Call of Duty eating up your internal SSD space?

Typically, these expansion cards hover around $125 during sales, with occasional steep discounts at Woot that sell out quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Black Friday, the WD BLACK C50 1TB Storage Expansion Card is $50 off its list price, making it the best Xbox storage deal you’ll likely find. Amazon hasn’t matched the price yet, but it’s worth keeping an eye on them in case Best Buy sells out before you grab one.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">"No Xbox Required" Streaming Bundle Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is currently offering a <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bDOw?object_uuid=1d1ca499-1fa5-40f7-9e75-cb85e8ecbe47&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">‘No Console Required’ Xbox Bundle</a> as part of its Black Friday sale. For just $79.99, you’ll snag a 4K Max Fire TV Stick, an Xbox Wireless Controller in any color of your choosing (we've gone for the new Sky Cipher variant) and 1 month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Separately, the items in the 4K Max bundle would set you back about $142, so you're saving $62. That’s a phenomenal deal to access Xbox’s Game Pass library without even needing a console. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't need the controller or Game Pass, a Fire TV Stick 4K is also now at its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-fire-tv-sticks-black-friday-2024">lowest-ever price of $21.99</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/october-2024-sales-charts-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sparks-xbox-game-pass-subscription-surge<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">82% of full-game Black Ops 6 sales were on PlayStation.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">October was a massive month for new releases, with eight of the top 10 games sold in the U.S. fresh launches. But as usual, none could quite touch the success of Call of Duty, and Black Ops 6 gave the franchise another debut at No.1 even with its inclusion in Xbox Game Pass. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This information comes from Circana's monthly report on U.S. video game spending by dollar sales, which saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> drive overall video game spending up 10% year-over-year to $4.7 billion, per an analysis by Circana's Mat Piscatella. It was the best-selling game of the month and is already the third best-selling game of the year to-date. In its first two weeks, Black Ops 6 sales were 23% higher than last year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023">Modern Warfare 3</a> sales over the same period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, a whopping 82% of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 full dollar sales were on PlayStation 5. But that shouldn't come as a surprise - this number counts full game purchases, and with Black Ops 6 appearing on Game Pass, it's likely most Xbox users took that route instead. But Circana also reports that non-mobile video game subscription spending industry-wide was up 16% year-over-year in October, and this was largely due to Black Ops 6 driving new Game Pass subscriptions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following Black Ops 6 on the sales charts was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a>, which is now the fourth best-selling game of the year so far, the best-selling Dragon Ball game in the U.S., and the third best-selling Bandai Namco game in history. Only <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> have done better from Bandai's portfolio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Third was the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, which is also officially the second best-selling Silent Hill game ever. It's beaten by, funnily enough, the original Silent Hill 2. BioWare's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> debuted at No.6 after launching on the last day of the month, but was beaten out by both Plaion's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/undisputed">Undisputed</a> at No.4 and fellow RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> at No.5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A few other interesting titles popped into the U.S. charts this month. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-i-vi-collection">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection</a> climbed from 90 last month to 19 this month perhaps due to a recent sale on the Nintendo Switch that dropped the price from a whopping $75 to nearly $55 (it's still going on!). Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a> soared from No.502 last month to No.9 on the Xbox top monthly active users chart, thanks to its recent addition to Xbox Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for hardware sales, it was an unsurprisingly less stellar month. Hardware spending was down 23% year-over-year, with Switch sales down 38%, PS5 down 20%, and Xbox Series down 18%. PS5 remains the best-selling hardware in both unit and dollar sales, and Xbox followed in second as the Switch nears the end of its lifecycle. Over in accessories, the PlayStation Portal was the best-selling item, and accessories spending was up 15%. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024">Black Friday sales</a> are also now live, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals-black-friday-2024">Xbox leading with plenty of deals</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Here are the top 20 best-selling games in the U.S. for the month of October, based on dollar sales:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Dragon Ball: Sparking!

The Heart of Chornobyl emanates stronger with each of us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thank You, stalkers!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl hit the one million sold milestone less than 48 hours after launching across PC and Xbox Series X and S. On Steam, it has a peak concurrent player count of 117,928, putting it among the most-played games on Valve’s platform. Microsoft does not make Xbox player numbers public.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clearly, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is already a success for GSC even before its first weekend on sale. However, the launch is not without problems, with players reporting a variety of bugs (check out IGN's S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 review in progress to find out more). <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-launches-big-on-steam-as-dev-promises-fixes-for-rough-edges">GSC has promised to sort out what it called S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2’s "rough edges"</a> with a steady stream of patches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Free in-game content is also coming to the game. Expect more on that when GSC Game World shares its roadmap later in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help you survive in the Zone, we've got a list of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Essential Stalker 2 Tips and Tricks</u></a>, plus a guide on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Things_to_Do_First_in_Stalker_2"><u>Things to Do First in Stalker 2</u></a> to help you through the early game, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Things_Stalker_2_Doesn%27t_Tell_You"><u>Things Stalker 2 Doesn't Tell You</u></a> - everything we wish we knew before we started playing. Save time scouring the wasteland with our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Artifacts_List_and_Locations"><u>Artifacts checklist and locations guide</u></a>, and every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Stash_Locations_and_Rewards"><u>Stash location</u></a> we've found so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 suffered a number of understandable delays, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-delayed-again-this-time-by-2-months-so-the-dev-can-fix-more-unexpected-anomalies"><u>most recently in July</u></a> when the game was due out in September. GSC said at the time that the extra two months would give the developers the chance to fix "unexpected anomalies," aka bugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GSC has also been vocal about the challenges the studio faced getting S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 up to scratch after a mixed reaction to its debut public showing last year. At gamescom 2023, GSC addressed what some had called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-devs-discuss-imperfect-gamescom-2023-demo-address-downgrade-debate"><u>a “downgrade” sparked by S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2’s then latest gameplay trailer</u></a>. At the time, GSC told IGN it was still targeting a visual quality and level of polish suggested by S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2’s eye-catching 2021 trailer despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-stalker-2-developers-say-the-war-in-ukraine-russian-hackers-and-death-threats-wont-break-them"><u>the horrendous conditions suffered by the staff amid the war with Russia</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
