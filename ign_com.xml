This is the third patch to arrive since last weekend’s release and adds a host of tweaks and fixes for glitches big and small. Although the update largely focuses on Multiplayer and Zombies, it also includes a trio of universal touch-ups, including the removal of that pesky black screen glitch that has bothered players when trying to load into a match.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/codblops6-1725926226920.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 update brings fixes for Multiplayer and Zombies.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6 Multiplayer adjustments include the removal of Lowtown from the Infected map pool while adding the same mode to Private Match’s list of available modes. Players will now find that the Shotgun Slug attachment deals the correct amount of damage, too. Stability improvements have also arrived to address hiccups revolving around the UAV Scorestreak, Infected medals, and the Vigilance Perk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s typical for some players to take advantage of map exploits shortly after launch, and it’s also typical for the team at Activision to move quickly when squashing these exploits. Today’s update is no different, as it comes with a few patched exploits in the Zombies mode. Specifically, enjoyers of the round-based game mode will no longer be able to re-activate timed GobbleGums for extra use. Additionally, the Tactical Raft can no longer be used to block zombie paths on Terminus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6 launched last Friday and has already positioned itself as one of the most successful Call of Duty games of all time. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the release was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record"><u>the series’ biggest launch ever</u></a> earlier this week. Call of Duty GM Matt Cox added, “Black Ops 6 is an amazing game, and the response from the Call of Duty community has been incredible. This is only the beginning.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the launch of the updated Nuketown map today, players can expect to dive into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-gets-nuketown-this-week-as-activision-reveals-season-1-plans"><u>Black Ops 6 Season 1 when it launches November 14</u></a>.

As for the entry’s single-player offering, we gave it a 9/10, saying, “An excellent string of missions that offer variety and flexibility come together to make Black Ops 6 the best Call of Duty campaign in many, many years.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see the full patch notes from today’s update below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 November 1, 2024 Patch Notes</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">GLOBAL</h3>Stability <ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed an issue where some players may encounter a black screen when loading into a public or private match for both Multiplayer and Zombies. </li></ul>Settings <ul data-cy="list"><li>Resolved an issue when trying to select DLSS or DLAA in the upscaling options. </li></ul>UI <ul data-cy="list"><li>Resolved an issue with the unlock notification for Diamond Mastery Badges.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">MULTIPLAYER</h3>Maps<ul data-cy="list"><li>Removed Lowtown from Infected map pool.</li></ul>Modes <ul data-cy="list"><li>Added Infected to Private Match mode select. </li><li>Resolved an issue in Free-For-All where scoring was based on total score rather than the number of elimination points.  </li><li>Resolved an issue in Search and Destroy where players could slide too far while defusing or planting the bomb. </li></ul>Weapons <ul data-cy="list"><li>Resolved an issue with the Slug attachment on Shotguns dealing incorrect damage. </li></ul>Progression <ul data-cy="list"><li>Resolved an issue where challenges requiring Dive Kills were not awarded properly.</li></ul>Stability <ul data-cy="list"><li>Resolved an issue with stability when using the UAV. </li><li>Resolved an issue with stability in Infected when earning medals. </li><li>Resolved an issue with stability when using the Vigilance perk.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">ZOMBIES</h3>Gameplay <ul data-cy="list"><li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to re-activate timed GobbleGums. </li></ul>Enemies <ul data-cy="list"><li>Specials and Elites killed by scorestreaks will no longer drop items. </li></ul>Terminus <ul data-cy="list"><li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to block zombie pathing with the Tactical Raft. </li></ul>Liberty Falls <ul data-cy="list"><li>Resolved an issue that prevented Scorestreaks from being used after completing the Main Quest. </li><li>Resolved an issue that would leave the player in spectator mode when dying after completing the Main Quest. </li></ul>Stability <ul data-cy="list"><li>Resolved an issue with stability when changing field upgrades. </li><li>Added various server-side stability fixes. </li></ul>UI <ul data-cy="list"><li>Adjusted round UI limit to 999 from 256. </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
