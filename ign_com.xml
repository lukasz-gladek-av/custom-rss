Addressing the situation, The Pok√©mon Company said it "deeply apologize[d] for any inconvenience" and was now conducting a review of all other cards, to ensure no other designs were at fault.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"To our community, thank you for your continued support and passion for Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket," The Pok√©mon Company <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/notice-regarding-new-illustrations" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>. "We want to share an important update regarding the upcoming expansion, Wisdom of Sea and Sky. It has come to our attention that there was a production issue regarding the illustration of Ho-Oh featured in the immersive card artwork for Ho-Oh EX (3-Star) and Lugia EX (3-Star).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After internal review, we discovered that the card production team provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards. As a result, both cards have been replaced with a temporary placeholder that the team is actively working to replace with new artwork as soon as it's ready.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are also conducting a broader investigation to ensure no similar issues exist elsewhere in the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, obtaining the card shows an empty card design with awkward-looking "New Art Coming Soon"  text ‚Äî and then a black screen in place of the card's immersive artwork. It doesn't look great.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Holy cow guys I can‚Äôt believe I opened this in Pokemon TCG pocket ü§Ø <a href="https://t.co/3st3ILATSW" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3st3ILATSW</a></p>‚Äî Poli (@ProfPoliwag) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfPoliwag/status/1950448109042962439?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday's controversy, which came after the Wisdom of Sea and Sky's card designs were datamined and examined online, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-claims-pokmon-tcg-pocket-features-a-design-traced-from-fan-art-creators-point-out-that-pokmons-legal-terms-likely-allow-the-company-to-monetise-any-fan-made-content-it-wants">sparked a wider discussion over the Pok√©mon's legal terms for fanart</a> ‚Äî which appear to suggest the company could, if it wanted, do whatever it liked with fan-made designs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's action strongly suggests that while The Pok√©mon Company may legally be able to argue it can use fan designs, it in practice does not want to typically do so, or leave fans thinking it now sees fanart as fair game for its commercial use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To all our players who have been looking forward to this expansion, and to the talented illustrators who bring the Pok√©mon world to life, we deeply apologize for any inconvenience this has caused," The Pok√©mon Company continued. "We take this matter very seriously and are committed to strengthening our quality control processes to prevent this from happening again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Thank you for your understanding, patience, and continued support of Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket. We remain dedicated to delivering an experience that you can enjoy."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/29/untitled-1-1753793405424.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Left: Ho-Oh's now-pulled Pok√©mon TCG Pocket card. Right: Ianjiujiu's original design.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN yesterday, video game industry legal expert Richard Hoeg, host of the Virtual Legality podcast, said The Pok√©mon Company's legal terms on fan art act as an acknowledgement that fans will create their own Pok√©mon art ‚Äî but that ultimately, from a legal standpoint, any publicly-shared designs fall under the ownership of The Pok√©mon Company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It effectively says 'Look, we (TPC/Nintendo) are legally still the only ones allowed to make derivative works (fan art included), but we all know you're going to do it," Hoeg said of the terms, "so if you do, on the off-chance it's special, we can use it without otherwise paying you (since it was ours to begin with)'."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's statement, however, suggests Pok√©mon TCG Pocket will not be featuring any more fan art anytime soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

In Japan, 1.9 million people have been told to evacuate and a tsunami wave of 1.3 meters (4.2 feet) has reached the northern Iwate prefecture, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c3r4x9yrrg4t" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the BBC reported</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/30/gettyimages-2226987668-1753863636100.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A woman watches a broadcast of a tsunami warning for coastal Japan outside a gaming shop in Tokyo.

IGN will remain on top of the story as it develops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As it stands, Japan's Meteorological Agency has said tsunami waves have reached parts of the country‚Äôs coast. The affected areas include the Fukushima, Miyagi, and Iwate prefectures, with waves potentially reaching as high as 3 meters (9 feet). Thousands of people have been told to evacuate for their safety, while the public broadcaster NHK has said there are no reports of major damage so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by RICHARD BROOKS/AFP via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
