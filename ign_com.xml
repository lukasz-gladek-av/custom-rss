            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">House of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian Studios’ multi-award-winning fantasy RPG, Baldur’s Gate 3, is set for its own TV series on HBO, and will be helmed by The Last of Us co-creator Craig Mazin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Deadline</u></a>, a television adaptation of the acclaimed game set in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe is in development at the network, and interestingly, will be a continuation of the story from the Baldur's Gate 3 game. The television show will reportedly take place after the events of Larian's RPG and follow the characters players grew to love over time as they grapple with the aftermath of its world-changing ending.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The series will be helmed by Craig Mazin, no stranger to adapting video games to live action, following his work co-creating HBO's The Last of Us with Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann. A huge fan of Baldur's Gate 3, Mazin told Deadline that "After putting nearly 1000 hours into the incredible world of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, it is a dream come true to be able to continue the story that Larian and Wizards of The Coast created". </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I am a devoted fan of D&amp;D and the brilliant way that Swen Vincke and his gifted team adapted it", he continued. "I can’t wait to help bring <em>Baldur’s Gate</em> and all of its incredible characters to life with as much respect and love as we can, and I’m deeply grateful to Gabe Marano and his team at Hasbro for entrusting me with this incredibly important property."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By taking on this project that has no ties to any other Baldur's Gate game in the pipeline, Mazin will have free rein over what story he wishes to tell, but we do know that it will include both existing and brand new members of the BG3 cast. Shadowheart? Karlach? Astarion? Who are you most looking forward to seeing on your television screen? Mazin reportedly plans to reach out to the cast of the games to sound out how best to approach their roles in the TV show, and if they'd want to be involved, something The Last of Us did with Merle Dandridge reprising her role as Marlene, for example.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the ending of Larian's multiple game of the year award-winning RPG can vary massively depending on how you chose to play the game, so it will be highly intriguing to see how Mazin and co. go about choosing which ending is canon for them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may well be a while yet before we see Baldur's Gate arrive on the small screen, with Mazin still attached to complete production on The Last of Us, which is gearing up for its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-certainly-seems-that-way-hbo-boss-gives-clearest-indication-yet-that-the-last-of-us-will-end-with-season-3">third, and maybe final</a>, season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.
