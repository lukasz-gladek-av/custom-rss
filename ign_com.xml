            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Time to reopen the Bureau.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Pokémon Presents, we saw a ton of new footage of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, including a brand new Mega Evolution. But for lore nerds, what was far more interesting was the official, confirmed appearance of a very popular character from our adventure in Pokémon X and Y. And yes, I'm going to spoil it for you below this video, so don't keep scrolling if you don't want to know.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you watched today's trailer, you'll know this isn't much of a spoiler: Emma, from Pokémon X and Y, is officially confirmed for Pokémon Legends: Z-A. Emma <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fans-are-frantically-trying-to-work-out-how-pokemon-legends-z-a-connects-to-other-pokemon-games">has been a part of fan speculation</a> ever since the game was announced, and theories about her presence in Z-A have only multiplied over time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some context, Emma is a young girl in X and Y who is adopted and trained by Looker, a detective in Lumiose City who's become a fan-favorite character after multiple game appearances. At the end of X and Y, Looker effectively hands over the keys to his Looker Bureau to Emma. We've already seen that the Bureau appears in this futuristic Lumiose, so it makes sense that Emma would be running it. What's more, her design suggests she's still running around the city as the crime-fighting Essentia, based on the outfit under her jacket.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— 【公式】ポケモン情報局 (@poke_times) <a href="https://twitter.com/poke_times/status/1947648245611536839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That said, Emma's presence does beg some questions. When exactly is Pokémon Legends: Z-A set? We don't know! Emma is definitely older in her Z-A appearance, but probably not so much older that there would have had time to essentially rebuild Lumiose from the ground up, from its X and Y aesthetic to the futuristic city appearing in Z-A. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Have there been time-traveling shenanigans? Is this Emma's daughter, also named Emma? Probably not that second one. Maybe the denizens of the Kalos region are just really, really fast at building cities.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="de" dir="ltr">Serebii Update: Official artwork for Emma &amp; Mable in Pokémon Legends Z-A <a href="https://t.co/NWlAdn57aQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/NWlAdn57aQ</a> <a href="https://t.co/zsdP9u36Dw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zsdP9u36Dw</a></p>— Serebii.net (@SerebiiNet) <a href="https://twitter.com/SerebiiNet/status/1947648427816308992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's also worth pointing out here that another familiar face from X and Y appeared during today's trailer, albeit one that's maybe a little less instantly recognizable. If you spotted Mable, the new director of the Pokémon Research Lab, you might have recognized that she's a former member of Team Flare. She's uh, not exactly the most moral of people in X and Y, so it will be interesting to see if she's reformed since then or if there's something unsavory going on at the research lab.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were other reveals during today's trailer, including brand new characters like Naveen, Lida, and either Urbain or Taunie. We also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-mega-pokmon-species-revealed-for-pokmon-legends-z-a">saw a brand new Mega Evolution, Mega Dragonite</a>. Pokémon Legends: Z-A is coming to Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on October 16, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything shown <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-presents-july-2025-everything-announced">during today's Pokemon Presents right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Arc System Works' next fighter will be playable at Evo 2025 in Las Vegas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The build being shown off at Evo 2025 will let players build their four-person team from a lineup of six Marvel favorites: Captain America, Iron Man, Storm, Star Lord, Ms. Marvel, and Doctor Doom. Players can get a feel for how Arc System Works' take on Marvel fighting feels, and walk away with a collectible pin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking place August 1 through 3, the Las Vegas Evo event is one of the largest fighting game tournaments of the year. Featuring main stage events around games like Street Fighter 6 and Tekken 8, as well as side tournaments and open competition around beloved niche games, it should be a good time to get Arc System Works' superhero game in the hands of some fighting game aficionados.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For those at home or in-person, a Developer Combat Panel will be held with members of both Arc System Works and the Marvel Games Development teams. The panel will air on Friday, August 1 at 8pm PT on the showcase stage and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EvoEvents" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streaming live on Evo's streaming channels</a>. Currently, the team is just teasing that it will shed some "new light on the core gameplay mechanics."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/22/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-debuts-at-evo-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, director Kazuto "Pachi" Sekine shared a brief message about the game:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is Sekine, Director of Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls," Sekine wrote. "I’d like to express our thanks on behalf of the entire development team for the incredible response to the State of Play trailer. The game is still under development, but we’re really looking forward to sharing more in our Evo panel, and especially for fans to try it out for themselves with the very first trial version at the event. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"My hope is to 'Assemble' with all of the players and create an amazing game together. We’re trying out many new things to offer a fresh experience. I can’t wait to hear your feedback and thoughts.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc System Works is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-is-a-4v4-fighting-game-from-the-developer-of-guilty-gear">well-known for its work</a> in the fighting game space on Guilty Gear, BlazBlue, and Dragon Ball FighterZ, so it's not an understatement to say many are curious to see what the developer will do with Marvel. Tōkon: Fighting Souls is definitely playing into some nostalgia for the universe's tag-fighting legacy, but with a style—and fighter count—all its own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls is currently aiming for a 2026 window on PS5 and PC. Meanwhile, if you want to tune into all the fighting game action at Evo 2025, the tournaments start on August 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-tkon-fighting-souls-will-be-playable-with-six-characters-at-evo-2025]]></content:encoded>

It's called Pokémon Friends, and it's a daily brain teaser game featuring lots of Pokémon-themed puzzles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the trailer, we got a look at a number of examples of the sorts of puzzles we'll encounter in Pokémon Friends. The first one showed a design of tiles with light bulbs on them, asking players to draw a line from one tile that touched every single other tile only once. Another had a player sliding lined tiles around to connect a path so that water could flow from one side to the other. Still others involved connecting train tracks, predicting which balloons wouldn't be popped by a flying arrow, sliding around an ice maze, and more. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All the games are themed around Pokémon such as Pikachu, Piplup, Mudkip, Sableye, and more. Completing puzzles gets the player in-game Pokemon plush items that they can use to decorate a virtual room.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Friends is out right now on iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch. It costs $9.99 on Nintendo Switch, and is "free to start" on mobile but eventually will block the player from progressing without paying.

Mega Dragonite actually takes inspiration from Dragonair with the wings on its head and pearl on its tail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Evolutions will factor into the story as well, as there will be Rogue Mega Evolution Pokémon who can't contain their own strength for some reason and need to be stopped.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Saber Interactive, the video game company behind Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, has announced a brand new Hellraiser game alongside a trailer that’s not for the faint of heart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival is a story-driven, single-player survival horror action game set in the Hellraiser universe. It's developed by Boss Team Games, creator of the recently delisted Evil Dead: The Game, and is due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hellraiser, for the uninitiated, is a cult classic horror franchise made up of 11 films and various comic books, all based on The Hellbound Heart novella by English author Clive Barker. The star of the show is Pinhead, a ‘Cenobite’ who harvests human souls to torture in sadistic experiments. And you can see that in action in the trailer, which — <strong>content warning!</strong> — contains as much sex as it does body horror.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer is certainly in keeping with the look and feel of Barker's original Hellraiser movie, which began life in the late 80s. We see one character use the franchise's infamous puzzle box, the Lament Configuration, to open a gateway to hell, and the Cenobites made famous by the movies walk through to do their thing. In a move sure to delight fans, actor Doug Bradley returns to the role of Pinhead for the first time in nearly two decades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barker is also involved in this new Hellraiser video game, helping out with the story. "Working on the first true Hellraiser game has been a venture deep into the recesses of my darkest imaginings,” he commented.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The dedication that Saber and Boss Team Games have shown is nothing short of remarkable. They’ve immersed themselves in the Hellraiser universe, capturing its essence — the seductive pull of suffering, the beauty within the grotesque — and forged a narrative that invites players to step beyond the threshold. I’m eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the Hellraiser mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Discover the tale of Aidan, who must unlock the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration, a mysterious puzzle box, to help his girlfriend from a hellish abyss. As Aidan, you’ll harness the box’s infernal abilities to survive your pact with the sinister Pinhead and battle against the twisted cult that worships him and the Cenobites. Fail, and your suffering will be legendary, even in Hell.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s talk of harnessing the abilities of the Genesis Configuration in combination with “earthly” weapons to “inflict bone-breaking, flesh-searing pain (or pleasure?) upon your enemies.” You fight hell's wretches, deviants, cultists, and priests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hellraiser was thrust back into the public consciousness in 2022 with a franchise reboot film. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hellraiser-review-2022-hulu">Hellraiser review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Hellraiser is a reinvigorated reboot that gets the blood pumping, starting with Jamie Clayton’s worthy Pinhead performance that sets a fresh tone with immense reverence paid to Clive Barker's works.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
