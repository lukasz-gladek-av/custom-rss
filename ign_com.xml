Kyle Katarn, the hero of the video game, is getting a Star Wars The Black Series action figure. It costs $27.99 and will be available on April 1. You can <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEJK0X?object_uuid=9870cfc4-de61-445b-9333-a279f52790ca&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder it now at Amazon</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder the Kyle Katarn Star Wars The Black Series Action Figure</h2><div catalogid="3f937f4b-037c-411e-aec2-713725ba325b" id="229948"><div id="229948" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kyle Katarn - Star Wars The Black Series Action Figure</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Kyle Katarn figure is six inches tall, with a good amount of articulation. It comes with a blaster and a blue-bladed Lightsaber, with a standard blade and one that mimics the blurred swinging effect. It’s a figure that looks good enough for adults to enjoy as a collectible, but it works equally well for play, with a suggest age range of 4+. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-dark-forces">Star Wars: Dark Forces hit PC in 1995</a>, with a port to PS1 the following year. It’s one of the early “Doom clones,” but it had strong enough story and gameplay elements to stand up on its own. Gameplay-wise, it included novel ideas like the ability to jump and duck, as well as to look up and down, all of which Doom and Doom 2 lacked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Forces is set in the (no-longer-canon) extended universe, around the time of the first Star Wars movie. It follows Kyle Katarn, a mercenary working for the Rebel Alliance, as he uncovers the Dark Troopers Project and goes about trying to stop it. This mission brings him all over the galaxy to locations like Jabba’s yacht, the Imperial mines on Gromas, inside a Star Destroyer, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars: Dark Forces got the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-dark-forces-remaster">remaster treatment</a> last year, making it accessible on modern platforms and tweaking its graphics and adding various quality-of-life improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Free-to-play hybrid action RPG Duet Night Abyss is out now worldwide on PC, mobile devices, and Epic Games Store featuring a dual narrative with two protagonists, no stamina limits for movement or commissions, and no character or weapon gacha systems. Let’s get into the details of what this game has to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Duet Night Abyss takes place in the world of Atlasia, where tree-like crystals called Heaventrees were viewed as gifts from the gods and gave rise to a central religion called the Elysian Church. Originally, practically everyone followed this religion, but over time, groups broke off and formed their own factions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play through the story from the perspectives of two protagonists with very different backgrounds, and you can freely choose and deploy each of them across different chapters. You’ll meet people from several of Atlasia’s different factions, and you can unlock many of them as playable characters by using character shards, which can be obtained either by buying the exact number you need for a specific character or by collecting them through gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters are not sorted into tiers or star ratings, all of them are just as viable in combat as the others. There are also no character gacha banners where you have to spend resources and just hope you eventually get what you want. You can identify the character you want, gather the required crystals, and be 100% guaranteed to unlock that character.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/image-4-1761248741433.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As the developers said when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/duet-night-abyss-dev-team-discusses-the-games-narrative-combat-and-latest-updates"><u>we interviewed them in August</u></a>, this was in response to player feedback and was with the goal of making the game more accessible to free-to-play (F2P) players. And as part of the game’s global launch rewards, players can complete events to unlock seven characters for free, giving you the opportunity to build the team you want right from the start. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter what characters you want to use in battle, you can equip them with both melee and ranged weapons and swap between them on the fly. Every character has access to every weapon type, so you can freely equip them however you want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Melee weapon options include standard choices like swords, polearms, and greatswords, as well as more unique ones like the whipsword. There are also a variety of ranged options, from a bow and arrow to dual pistols, grenade launchers, and shotguns. And like characters, weapons aren’t locked behind banners and aren’t sorted into different tiers or star ratings. So you can use whichever combination of weapons you want with no optimization lost.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/melee-and-ranged-weapons-1761248804318.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat will pit you against waves of enemies in hack-and-slash action, where you’ll mow down hordes of foes in seconds. The flow of combat stays quick thanks to the fact there are several mobility options with no stamina requirements, so no need to keep your eye on a gauge to see what moves you can use. At any time, you can sprint, use a grappling hook, dodge, jump, double jump, wall jump, or Helix Leap, which in one button press allows you to cover very long distances very quickly.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/image-6-1761248842756.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can tackle commissions with up to three players in co-op mode, or go solo with two AI companions. There are no stamina restrictions for commissions either, so you’re not limited to only a certain amount of time you can play freely. And you can further customize your fighting style with Demon Wedges, which are versatile add-ons that you can obtain during commissions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Demon Wedges come in three varieties: character, melee weapon, and ranged weapon. They can provide boosts to your health, crit rate, attack speed, and other attributes. These boosts are guaranteed at a set level when you acquire and upgrade them, so you don’t have to keep grinding for the same thing and hoping to get a better version. There’s no randomization involved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of stat boosts, Demon Wedges can also change the mechanics of your characters’ attacks and skills, and you can combine these with certain weapon traits to customize your attack pattern. And once you’ve acquired a Demon Wedge, you can use it across as many characters or weapons as you want. So again, no need to farm for additional versions to equip multiple of them.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/image-7-1761248877455.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters, weapons, and Demon Wedges can all be obtained through normal gameplay. The game’s monetization model is currently focused only on cosmetics, with a range of character skins, accessories, patterns, dye colors, and weapon skins. Both outfits and weapons can be dyed, allowing for an additional level of customization.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/24/character-skins-1761338540276.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers recently unveiled new skins for the characters Psyche, Rebecca, and the duo Truffle and Filbert. They also revealed Christmas-themed skins and a new sword skin called Tough Love. And as part of the game’s global launch rewards, players can get up to 107 Pristine Hourglass and Prismatic Hourglass just for logging in. These items can be used to draw new skins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Duet Night Abyss is available to download now on PC, iOS, and Android.
