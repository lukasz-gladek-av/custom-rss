This latest installment of the long-running franchise brings you back to World War II and has you blast Nazis from afar (or close up, depending on how you choose to complete the missions). It’s coming out in two editions and both are now available to preorder. Read on for the details.</p><p id="standard-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Standard Edition">Sniper Elite: Resistance - Standard Edition</h2></p><p id="deluxe-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Deluxe Edition">Sniper Elite: Resistance Deluxe Edition</h2></p><p id="also-on-xbox-game-pass"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Also on Xbox Game Pass">Sniper Elite: Resistance Will Be on Xbox Game Pass</h2></p><div catalogid="c2144f25-673f-4eef-99a0-d341bcc285b1" id="214204"><div id="214204" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate – 3 Month Membership</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want a cheaper way to play the game, you’ll also be able to play Sniper Elite: Resistance on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass on January 30.</p></div><p id="preorder-bonus"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Preorder Bonus">Sniper Elite: Resistance Preorder Bonus</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/15/sniper-elite-resistance-preorder-1736970278515.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Preorder any version of Sniper Elite: Resistance, and you’ll receive the following preorder bonuses:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Standard Edition</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Target Führer - Lights, Camera, Achtung campaign mission</li><li>1x weapon skin</li><li>Karabiner 98 rifle</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Deluxe Edition</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Target Führer - Lights, Camera, Achtung campaign mission</li><li>1x weapon skin</li><li>Karabiner 98 rifle</li><li>M1911 pistol</li></ul><p id="what-is-sniper-elite-resistance"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What Is Sniper Elite: Resistance?">What Is Sniper Elite: Resistance?</h2></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sniper Elite: Resistance is a first-person shooter set in the European theater during WWII.

When you score a kill, you’ll still be treated to a slow-mo X-ray shot of the bullet wreaking havoc on the internal organs of your enemies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New to the series this time around are Propaganda Missions, which give you a limited amount of time to sneak in and complete tasks. And returning from previous installments is Axis Invasion mode, which lets you invade another player’s campaign as an enemy to take them down.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-gets-suit-from-playstations-spider-man-2-later-this-month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> players are being treated to an unlikely crossover that brings the Advanced Suit 2.0 from Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 into the game as a new skin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation announced the news itself in <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1879574341538435297" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post on X/Twitter</u></a>, revealing a first look at how NetEase Games is reimagining the classic video game outfit for its new hero shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This sleek Spider-Man suit made its debut as an original design for Insomniac Games’ Marvel’s Spider-Man, going on to make appearances in all three entries in that series. The main element setting this suit apart from the rest is its now-iconic white spider symbol, with its appearance in Marvel Rivals cementing it as a surprise collaboration with Sony and its console-exclusive superhero game. Expect Spider-Man’s Advanced Suit 2.0 to swing into the in-game store on January 30, the same day <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-pc-officially-announced-with-january-release-date"><u>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 comes to PC</u></a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/15/sm-1736966875475.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Marvel Rivals has a surprise collaboration with Sony's Spider-Man game.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals launched in December and already offers a smorgasbord of unlockable suits, but this new Spidey suit arrives as an especially unique addition. Along with its ties to the massively popular PlayStation series, the Advanced Suit 2.0 will once again be worn by a Spider-Man who is voiced by Yuri Lowenthal. The actor has played Peter Parker in all three of Insomniac’s Spider-Man games and also happens to have provided his talents for Marvel Rivals’ take on the character. In other words, those who pick up the costume come January 30 should feel right at home as they thwip their way to victory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase's decision to bring Spider-Man’s Advanced Suit 2.0 into the fold gives players another piece of content to look forward to among <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-details-the-fantastic-four-new-maps-and-mode-coming-in-season-1"><u>everything that dropped with Season 1: Eternal Night Falls</u></a> last week.
