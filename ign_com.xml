The developer said it believed the "large number of gameplay videos" now floating around the internet — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-faces-uphill-battle-to-stop-resident-evil-requiem-leaks-as-ending-spoilers-and-videos-appear-online"><u>some of which contain huge spoilers and clips of the game's finale</u></a>, which IGN verified as legitimate — originated from copies obtained "through illegal means."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in a <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/2025040184614728119" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>message</u></a> posted to Twitter/X and translated by machine (which means there may be some inaccuracies or missing nuance), Kamiya reflected on how spoilers also impacted the release of Resident Evil 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm sure the final developments of [Resident Evil 2] were also exposed in a weekly photo magazine…" he wrote. "For your own selfish satisfaction, you trample on the feelings of the users who were looking forward to the game, as well as the feelings of the creators who put all their effort into making it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a despicable act that destroys the happiness of everyone, and deserves a thousand deaths... May you be cursed to never be able to play games again..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom stressed the posting of these videos constitutes copyright infringement, as well as generally being "an act that offends other customers." However, the publisher seems somewhat limited in what it can actually do in response, suggesting it will simply delete the videos or issue "warnings."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, we don't have long to wait now, as Resident Evil Requiem's February 27 release date is but a few short days away. "After getting hands-on with a total of about four hours of Resident Evil 9 Requiem at this point, and sharing that experience with colleagues, I’m more excited for the series than I have been in recent memory," IGN wrote after going <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-second-take-preview"><u>hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem</u></a> recently. "It’s the old mixed with the new, but all in a modern package with two protagonists I already like a lot."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
