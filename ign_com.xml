While the 40+ level matchmaking option, Solo vs. Squads, was positioned by developer Embark Studios to be its big selling point, some players are more concerned with the return of an item duplication exploit and how it has affected the in-game (duck) economy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qqb1oq/evidence_of_a_bp_duplication_glitch_in_matches_we/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no doubt</a> using the dupe glitch to amass piles of rare items like blueprints, it seems a few fans are manipulating the system to make some serious coin – and maybe even a quick joke. The duck has slowly become a bit of a running gag for fans on its own, as the squeaky bath toy is one of a few lightweight trinkets that can be found topside and then sold in Speranza for a decent chunk of Raider Coins. It also happens to be the sillier items in Arc Raiders, so when a recently patched dupe glitched returned in a new form, those looking to exploit the system knew just what to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who are discovering topside players with hundreds of ducks, however, are just confused.</p><p>Did we come across the duck Santa Clause or something?<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Did we come across the duck Santa Clause or something?” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qmdxju/what_the_duck_is_this_we_found_two_dead_raiders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user said</u></a> a few days before the launch of Headwinds. “Dupe hacking gone wild? At first we thought it was some joke because the stash was just full of ducks but then we realized they were stacks of 15 ducks each.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Okay so I actually came across a guy in blue gate in a random house just spamming ducks on the ground,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qmdxju/comment/o1lccl2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>. “I assumed he was duping. The floor was littered with them, probably like 100 of them. He wouldn't respond and kinda just stared at me til I walked away.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders’ mallard problem has only gotten bigger in the aftermath of Headwinds, as the January content update also introduced a handful of more valuable (and more vibrant) ducks to collect as part of the new Bird City map condition. It’s resulted in an abundance of ducks across Buried City…and some very awkward moments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A raider caught on fire in Buried City Metro, went down without saying a word, and left behind a mountain of Familiar Ducks,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qqv3yd/a_raider_caught_on_fire_in_buried_city_metro_went/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user shared</u></a>. “I extracted with $2.8M. Still confused.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Was doing the pharmacist quest for Lance, heard the tell tale duck noise...came upon this silent raider,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qpvg2q/random_encounter/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>person said</u></a>, sharing a picture of a solo Raider standing alone in a dark attic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Referencing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-and-the-finals-hit-by-extensive-coordinated-ddos-attacks-dev-says"><u>a recent cyber-attack</u></a> against Embark and Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qpvg2q/comment/o2cofp8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>someone replied</u></a>, “This must be what brought down the servers. DDOS (Duck Duplication on Server).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a game that constantly sees players backstabbing each other for a small chance to net worthwhile resources, it’s hard to deny the comedy in PvP players only finding stacks upon stacks of little rubber duckies. Still, it’s definitely the kind of thing Embark <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters">promised to clean up earlier this month</a>. Players have complained of cheaters and exploiters in Arc Raiders for weeks, so as goofy as these issues are, they are still causing some players to worry that others have an unfair advantage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's especially concerning for those who have kept up with Arc Raiders updates since launch. Embark <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-12-0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued update 1.12.0</a> January 20 and fixed a handful of exploits, including an item duplication glitch. It took less than a week for players to begin reporting what appears to be a new version of the exploit, and it's unclear how long it will take for the developers to publish a new patch or how many other glitches will be discovered in the meantime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Arc Raiders cheater crackdown has seen <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-update-targets-infamous-stella-montis-glitch-but-some-say-rats-are-still-in-the-walls">holes plugged in Stella Montis</a> to try and ward off wall explolits, while some players, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/streamer-tfue-hit-with-30-day-arc-raiders-ban-amid-cheater-purge-then-immediately-unbanned">like streamer Tfue</a>, have found themselves banned (and then unbanned) without notice. As Embark tries to bring cheats to a halt, players are still finding the fun both in and outside of the game. Some have even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/please-try-to-be-friendly-to-other-guests-arc-raiders-players-bombard-real-life-stella-montis-hotel-with-5-star-reviews">looked to the real-world Stella Montis hotel to leave positive reviews</a>.
