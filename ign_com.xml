            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The story behind the Metal Gear Solid Board Game is nearly as wild as the plot of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-games-in-order">Metal Gear game</a>, featuring a mix of delays and licensing issues, with odds stacked against it ever seeing the light of day before being rescued (much like Solid Snake rescuing Gray Fox) by CMON Games. But at long last, this cardboard adaptation of the Hideo Kojima masterpiece has finally reached the masses. From sneaking around in cardboard boxes to dynamic and exciting boss fights, the game’s tactical stealth gameplay has successfully made the jump from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">video games to board games</a>. However, the whole package isn’t without its faults, leaving me feeling both satisfied and let down at the same time.</p><div catalogid="f71f0ecf-f449-4d70-ad81-bc7b3b9d5ab7" id="217981"><div id="217981" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Metal Gear Solid The Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid: The Board Game is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign-style board game</a> that retells the story of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid">first Metal Gear Solid game</a>, originally released on the PlayStation in 1998. Designed for one to four players (at least according to the box; more on that below), the game has players move plastic miniature versions of series favorites like Meryl, Otacon, Cyborg Ninja Gray Fox, and Solid Snake himself through 14 scenarios featuring iconic moments from the game, such as the confrontation with Ocelot, changing the PAL Keycard, and, of course, taking out REX.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, there is one significant omission that didn’t make the cut: the final confrontations between Solid and Liquid are not recreated as playable scenarios. It’s a bummer that neither the barehanded fight on top of REX nor the Jeep escape is included. Perhaps the developers couldn’t find a way to balance or explain a 4v1 battle on REX or figure out how the escape would work with all present characters. Instead, they've opted to end on the high note of a dramatic and memorable team-up against Metal Gear REX. But in the meantime, the fan community around this game has you covered. Over on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/296527/fan-made-scenario-stage-15-liquid-vs-solid" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>BoardGameGeek, user @Geoff907</u></a> and their wife devised and published their own unique Stage 15 for this game for you to try out, if you just absolutely need to get some of that shirtless fist-fight action into your game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you opt for the more expensive “Integral Edition,” the rest of the story bits that aren't told through gameplay are instead presented in a striking 109-page graphic novel with art by comic artist Kenneth Loh. It's reminiscent of the scenes in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker or the Digital Graphic Novels on PSP. But MGS wouldn’t be MGS without its CODEC calls. These little burst transmissions between Snake and his support team have been faithfully adapted to this new format, with prompts directing players to specific calls in the included Codec Book, as well as pre and post-scenario briefings. I particularly appreciate the care the developers have taken to make them just as campy yet informative as those in the video game. For example, Snake refers to how many actions he can take or offers tips on beating Psycho Mantis involving “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/metal-gear-solid/How_to_Beat_Psycho_Mantis">Player 2</a>”-like trickery. Even as a game made of cardboard and dice, this still feels distinctly Metal Gear.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Players unlock new equipment, from Snake’s favorite sidearm, the Socom, to the iconic cardboard box.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Regarding gameplay, players take up to four actions per turn, chosen from those listed on their character’s unique player boards. As scenarios progress, players unlock new equipment, from Snake’s favorite sidearm, the Socom, to the iconic cardboard box, which can be used in future scenarios. This equipment expands each character’s skill pool, effectively replicating the video game’s “procure on-site” philosophy. Once players take their actions, it’s time for the enemies to act. Both generic guards and bosses have action cards that dictate their movements and behaviors, which can change depending on whether they’ve spotted the player. Guards also have a separate reaction deck used in various situations, such as spotting a knocked-out guard or investigating a noise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boss encounters pose their own unique challenges, forcing you out of your comfort cardboard box and requiring you to think on your feet. Each boss fight feels distinct, from Revolver Ocelot darting around while bouncing bullets off walls to the Hind D having multiple target areas to damage. Thanks to the game’s tile-based nature, each boss fight takes place on a unique, large board with special elements affecting the encounter. For example, in Ocelot’s arena, the injured Kenneth Baker can be hit and killed, adding a new way to trigger a game over. These special tweaks only enhance the excitement and tension of the encounters, as they are rarely designed to favor the players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This element of randomness kept me on my toes, never knowing exactly how far guards would move or which way they’d turn. The added dice rolls for checking if my actions made noise or if enemy shots would hit me resulted in an experience that balanced strategy with luck. There were multiple moments where I held my breath as I pulled a guard movement card, waiting to see if I’d be spotted. I never felt the game was unfair, but I also never expected it to be kind. Metal Gear does a superb job balancing strategy and luck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the box suggests the game can be played with up to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four players</a>, at least for the campaign mode, I wouldn’t recommend going beyond two players. Personally, I found playing it as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a> offered the best experience. Each scenario specifies which of the four playable characters can be used, with the first two scenarios playable only by Snake. Only five scenarios in the entire campaign allow for four players (with no missions designed for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-three-player-board-games">three players</a>), and the first four-player mission doesn’t appear until the ninth scenario.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From a narrative standpoint, this makes sense. It wouldn’t be logical for Snake to infiltrate Shadow Moses with Gray Fox at his side or for Otacon to tackle Vulcan Raven alone. But from a board game perspective, this limitation significantly impacts the experience, making it hard to convince my MGS-loving friends to play when only one of them could participate in most of the game, while the others had to wait for the last few missions. I would have loved to see optional modifiers allowing additional characters in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player</a> scenarios or “What if?” scenarios offering alternate viewpoints and player counts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To the game’s credit, the developers addressed this issue by allowing up to four players in the “VR Missions” mode. This additional mode, which includes its own set of special unlockable equipment cards, </p><p data-cy="paragraph">has its own caveat: a lack of content. The included VR Missions book features six mission types – Recon, Escape, and Sabotage, among others – but each type has only one associated map layout. While some tokens and traps may change between sessions, and you can swap in a boss model for extra challenge, the guard layouts and objectives remain the same. With the map never changing, once you know what to do, the mode quickly loses its luster. I hope that CMON or the community releases creative and fun new maps and missions to keep things fresh.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9YOmrx?object_uuid=2a3bae9b-fd59-40a6-8568-380ae799f55d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">More Board Games Based on Video Games</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also check out our recent reviews of board games based on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-cells-the-rogue-lite-board-game-review">Dead Cells</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-the-board-game-review">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-the-board-game-review">Elden Ring</a>. </p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 1, 2025 6:00 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Metal Gear Solid: The Board Game successfully distills much of the tactical espionage action from the video game into an engaging and challenging board game adaptation. The gameplay and miniatures are the stars of the show, striking a great balance between creativity and strategy. However, restrictions on character selection and player count for most of the campaign make it difficult to play with a full group of friends. When paired with the limited stage options in VR Missions, what could have been a sturdy and impressive cardboard box ends up feeling like one that’s been tossed onto too many FedEx trucks on its way to delivery—functional but slightly battered.
If you’re a fan of solo play or want to experience the game with one other person, you’ll find plenty to love. But if you’re looking for a game to play with a group of three or more, you may want to think twice before diving in.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Among them, he says it might be time for Sony to reconsider its adherence to cutting-edge graphics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001814.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AVWatch</a> (translated via <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1906929110980653479" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genki_JPN</a>), Yoshida said it's time for PlayStation to reconsider its focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Up until now, PlayStation's DNA has been driven by values such as 'cutting-edge graphics' that have continued since [Ken Kutaragi]'s time," Yoshida said. "Users have also expected that from PlayStation games. However, it's about time we have to reconsider that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, I think it's necessary to provide the very best (in terms of graphics quality) to those who want it," Yoshida continued. "But, in order to continue to be popular with users in a broad sense, we naturally have to change our way of thinking."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's little doubt that games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us Part 2</a>, or other major Sony exclusives have put a lot of focus into graphical fidelity. Yet Yoshida's comments indicate it might be time to reconsider approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether that's a focus on relatively smaller experiences like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, or a complete pivot to lo-fi or stylized graphics, it's not suggested. But with the price of making a big, AAA game like those in Sony's stable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/major-publishers-report-aaa-franchises-can-cost-over-a-billion-to-make">seemingly only going up</a>, fresh approaches might be welcome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the only insight Yoshida has shared in his interview rounds. The former PlayStation exec <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-nier-automata-revived-the-japanese-games-industry-convinced-it-to-stop-chasing-overseas-trend">also discussed NieR: Automata's impact on the games industry</a>, especially in Japan. Whether that's the blueprint for a renewed approach to games or not, I certainly wouldn't complain about more games like NieR: Automata going around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/den-of-wolves-hands-on-preview-payday-meets-inception-in-this-mind-bending-co-op-heist-simulator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The Usual Suspects are back up to their old tricks.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It honestly shocks me that there aren’t more heist games, because I can think of few experiences more awesome than carrying out my boyhood lawbreaking fantasies with the lads. Thankfully, after more than a decade away from the glamor and gunpowder of criminal activity, a group of familiar faces behind Payday: The Heist and Payday 2 have taken a break from making the insanely difficult co-op shooter GTFO to go back to what they do best. And that is, make games where you and your friends work together to break the law by pulling off a series of elaborate and high-risk burglaries for no other reason than to satisfy your wanton greed. But where the Payday series was and continues to be a fairly standard game about robbing banks, the upcoming Den of Wolves adds a compelling sci-fi world with a gritty, cyberpunk flair, multi-phase planning and execution of break-ins where you can decide exactly how you want to pull it off, and most importantly: the ability to dive into the minds of others to steal the valuable secrets hidden within their brains. If that doesn’t get your blood pumping, I don’t know what will!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Den of Wolves takes place in the extremely dark near future where the world’s technology ecosystem imploded due to hackers, and corporations were given free rein to do whatever they pleased to combat the crisis, including but not limited to human experimentation, and building dangerous and unpredictable technologies (y’know, your basic cyberpunk hellscape stuff) so long as they kept their activities contained to the newly minted libertarian dystopia and Andrew Ryan’s wet dream: Midway City. Naturally this leads to corporations storing their data straight inside totally unhackable human brains, transforming the host to all that delicious data into a wonderful little flesh battery, from the looks of it. But we’re hardened criminals, guys. Are we really gonna let a super creepy meat computer locked away in a bank vault get in the way of us pulling off heists? I think not!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Den of Wolves GDC 2025 Preview Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, Den of Wolves has you and three friends planning and carrying out a series of felonies in Midway City, where you’ll overcome those pesky brain-based security systems by mind-melding with victims to rip off their secrets and make off with the loot. My demo focused on a single operation where my crew and I planned and executed a high-stakes assault on a bank currently under new management by a very aggressive street gang with power and tech enough to rival world governments – pretty nasty stuff. In this particular case, our plan of attack was to use a swarm of drones acquired from a previous robbery to ambush a number of these gang members to gain entrance into the reinforced stronghold, then go loud as possible, shooting up the place with reckless abandon until we found what we were looking for. In this instance, the big prize was the data inside someone’s head who was locked safely away inside a vault and scarcely resembled a human anymore; truly just straight nightmare fuel, if I’m being honest.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You'll mind-meld with victims to rip off their brain's secrets and make off with the loot.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of this caper went off in a way any Payday fan will immediately recognize: we used a variety of automatic weapons to smash and grab everything in sight while holding off waves of folks who were quite mad about being ripped off, deploying and repairing drills that break every couple seconds even in a sci-fi future, apparently. Naturally, cooperation was critical to our success, as we laid down cover fire for one another, revived downed teammates who got caught in a bad spot, and called out to one another as we heaved bags full of loot across the ruined fortress. There really wasn’t a whole lot new about the foundation of this heist game, aside from maybe the consumable equipment abilities that let my squad do things like throw down a temporary barrier that provided some limited cover in the middle of a fight.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But all that changed when the bank vault doors slid open, revealing the prize we were chasing after: a caterpillar-like human lump locked away to contain valuable secrets. After a little bit of hacking, we lept from the physical plane and into the mind of this person to hack open their brain and make off with their secrets. Now, I don’t know what exactly is going on in the mind of this clearly and understandably disturbed individual, but what we found waiting for us inside his dome was an unsettling and surreal series of landscapes that we had to leap between to gain access to their thoughts. And since we were on a timer, we couldn’t afford to take our time or slip up, lest we get booted back out to the real world and have to continue to hold out against enemies before getting another crack at it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was the only brain I dove into in my limited time with Den of Wolves, but I was told that every mind would present unique challenges to play against, not just the high-stakes platforming of our current mission. And while it remains to be seen just how interesting or how much variety these will have, this section completely shook up an otherwise familiar formula in a seriously cool way. I love shooting at rival criminal gangs and robo cops as much as the next convicted felon, but it was really neat to jump back and forth between reality-based FPS combat and completely bizarre cooperative platforming in a geometrically impossible world of imagination. That really helps to set this one apart from what I worried might just be a Payday sequel with a cyberpunk skin plastered over it. Instead, it seems Den of Wolves plans on taking some real risks and trying stuff that makes it weird and interesting, and I’m absolutely down for that.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In between trips into our poor, troubled victim’s mind, we were yanked right back out to where we left off, only milliseconds apparently having elapsed in meat space while we went parading around in someone’s noggin. After jumping back into his skull for a few additional servings of deeply uncomfortable jumping puzzles, we got what we came for and made our exit by blowing up some windows with high explosives and diving out to what I can only hope was some Assassin's Creed-style hay piles waiting conveniently placed just below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Den of Wolves borrows quite a bit from Payday and other crime games, the setting, elaborate planning mechanics, and especially its surreal mind-hacking mechanics all made me feel pretty confident that developer 10 chambers’ return to the wonderful world of heisting has a good chance of being another stunning success. Here’s hoping they can pull off the score of a lifetime when this thing eventually makes its way into early access on PC.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
