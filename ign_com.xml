            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f"><u>Silent Hill f</u></a> fans pore over the slew of previews that went live recently (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-we-played-it-for-5-hours"><u>you can read ours right here</u></a>), two questions are consistently popping up on social media and fan communities: is the latest mainline Silent Hill <em>really</em> a 'Soulslike' game? And if it is, what does the term 'Soulslike' even mean anyway?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we described in IGN's Silent Hill f hands-on preview, combat itself has a similar feel to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake"><u>Silent Hill 2 Remake</u></a>’s close-range combat. You can dodge enemy attacks with the DualSense’s circle button and activate a light and heavy attack with R1 and R2, respectively. Your limited reach and lengthy attack motions give a realistic, weighty feel to combat. Heavy attacks, especially, feel slow and need to be timed well, "contributing to the feeling that Hinako is just a teenager with limited strength."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, however, Silent Hill f’s combat also features timed dodges and counterattacks, with the latter particularly important in combat sequences. Enemies briefly show a sign when a counterattack can be utilized, but we suggested that "unless you have trained your reflex skills by playing games like of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice"><u>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</u></a>, you will likely have a hard time reacting." That’s where the Focus mode comes in, which can be triggered by holding L2. It allows counterattacks to last longer, while also charging up a power attack that staggers an enemy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While series producer Motoi Okamoto hasn't specifically mentioned the Soulslike genre, and by our estimation, Silent Hill f is "by no means a Soulslike," talk of parries and counterattacks come as quite the surprise to Silent Hill fans. The franchise has never been famous for its clunky combat — story and atmosphere have almost always come first — but Okatomo's suggestion that f's combat sequences had been ratcheted up because "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-is-combat-heavy-because-challenging-action-games-are-gaining-popularity-among-younger-players-nowadays"><u>challenging action games are gaining popularity among younger players nowadays</u></a>" has pretty much split the fandom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The legacy of FromSoftware’s Souls series isn’t just defined by the amazing games in its back-catalog, but also the subgenre that’s been given life thanks to its very existence: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-soulslike-games">The Soulslike</a>. While defining one is kinda tricky, there are core elements that tend to apply to Souls games, such as punishing consequences for death, Souls — or a similar currency — gained by defeating enemies that is integral to character progression and can be lost upon death, methodical combat, typically tied to a stamina meter, and checkpoints that reset the world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some, however, Soulslike can simply mean tough melee combat that involves learning to predict an enemy's attack pattern.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a thread entitled, "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mhvpsr/silent_hill_f_is_not_soulslike_and_no_one_here/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Silent Hill f is not 'souls-like' and no one here seems to know what that means</u></a>," a Redditor said: "Genuinely baffling. This is link [sic] second graders being told to name an object and call a toaster a blender. Like, I don't think you even know what a Soulslike is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Having a dodge roll and hard bosses applies to like 90% of third-person games that exist lol. Like you people cannot be serious. Souls games have heavy and light attack, tight-nit dodge intensive combat. You have frame-perfect dodges [...] huge emphasis on stamina management, with shields, break meters, and focus on killing enemies to get c[urrency].</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Silent hill f has like 1.5 of those. This blatant lie needs to stop. Anyone with eyes who isn't full of sh*t can see this is nothing like a Soulslike."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the broader confusion between what and what is not indicative of a "Soulslike" game that's frustrating players, though. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To be fair, nobody knows what a Soulslike is," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mhvpsr/comment/n6zgeh4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>admitted</u></a> a respondent. "This is clearly demonstrated on the Soulslike sub by daily arguments about whether or not a game is a Soulslike."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've sunk hundreds of hours into FromSoftware's games and Soulslikes like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nioh"><u>Nioh</u></a>," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mhvpsr/comment/n6z9t9x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a> someone else. "Nothing about Silent Hill f looks like a Soulslike other than there's a target lock-on system and a stamina meter. Which is in, you know: a million other games that are not goddamn Soulslikes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Confusingly, others who have also played Souls-inspired games don't concur, however, leading to considerable disagreement to what does, and does not, make a Soulslike game. Is it the melee combat? The need to parry? Or does any game that requires players to learn an enemy's attack pattern count? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I’m still excited for the game, but the comparisons to Souls combat are really clear guys, like come on…" posited <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mhvpsr/comment/n70id3x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one</u></a>. "Invincible dodge, lock on system, light and heavy attacks, multiple attempt boss fights testing your combat prowess… Even the combat UI is clearly inspired by action games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"People complain about the combat becoming melee-focused like they don't remember <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/09/23/silent-hill-4-the-room"><u>Silent Hill 4</u></a>. Breakable weapons are essential without the firearms if we still want the game to stay a survival horror," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mi55z5/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_see_anything_wrong/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>explained</u></a> another fan. "This whole situation feels like Silent Hill 2 Remake all over again with almost the same talking points."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-combat-has-a-heavier-focus-on-melee-and-is-more-action-oriented-than-silent-hill-2-remakes-producer-says"><u>Okamoto said that tougher combat</u></a>, with the visuals and music's "juxtaposition between beauty and terror," along with the "terrible beauty of the game’s monster design," makes for a terrifying adventure. Even the puzzles are apparently "grounded in psychological anguish and suffering." Quite how players react to all that when Silent Hill f finally releases next month, of course, remains to be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f takes us to 1960s Japan, where we'll follow Hinako Shimizu, a teenager struggling under the pressure of expectations from her friends, family, and society. As displayed at the beginning of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/silent-hill-f-official-japanese-trailer"><u>Japanese-language reveal trailer</u></a> back in March, it is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-the-first-in-konamis-horror-series-to-get-an-18-rating-in-japan"><u>the first Silent Hill game to get an 18+ rating certification in Japan</u></a>. It's out for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series on September 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you're wondering, no, Silent Hill f is not a sequel to any of the existing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/silent-hill"><u>Silent Hill games</u></a>, so you can play it even if you've never jumped into a Silent Hill game before. Instead, it will offer a standalone story "independent from the series." That came from publisher Konami itself, which finally confirmed on X/Twitter that the latest instalment of the horror series — which is usually, if not always, set in a sleepy resort town on east-coast America — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-a-completely-new-title-that-people-who-have-never-played-the-series-can-enjoy-konami-says"><u>will be "a completely new title" that "people who have never played the Silent Hill series can enjoy</u></a>."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> contains another card design that looks similar to unofficial artwork, just days after the game was forced to scrub the illustrations from several cards within its new expansion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-suddenly-pulls-card-design-embroiled-in-plagiarism-controversy-as-company-admits-production-issue-and-launches-wider-investigation">The Pokémon Company confessed it had used fan art as a close reference for Pokémon TCG Pocket's new Ho-Oh EX card</a>, found in the hit smartphone game's new Wisdom of Sea and Sky expansion. The matter came to light after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-claims-pokmon-tcg-pocket-features-a-design-traced-from-fan-art-creators-point-out-that-pokmons-legal-terms-likely-allow-the-company-to-monetise-any-fan-made-content-it-wants">fans alleged that the Ho-Oh card's design had been traced from unofficial artwork</a> previously published online. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, fans have pointed to yet another card that may have been closely inspired by fan art: Buzzwole EX's Immersive Rare card, which sees the insectoid Ultra Beast flying through space with one arm raised aloft, in a Superman-esque pose. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While not an identical copy, the concept, framing and pose is very similar in appearance to a piece of fan art published online back in 2017, some fans have now said. But others aren't so sure, and pointed out that Buzzwole holding its arm up, flexing its swole muscles, is at least something the creature is often seen doing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was scrolling through my old camera roll when I thought I saw the immersive Buzzwole but then upon further inspection, it was fanart I saved of him from 2017," Ricky_chimmerton wrote on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTGCP/comments/1metn1y/found_very_old_buzzwole_fanart_from_2017_that" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>. "I know it ain’t an exact copy but this image was definitely referenced for the card we have."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Similar pose, but not the same. It could have been an inspiration, but it was clearly not traced," countered fellow fan Aestrasz. "The issue is not them taking inspiration from a fan art, and doing a similar pose. The problem was tracing the fan art."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Similar is an understatement but yeah at least in this case you can see it wasn’t just a complete copy," wrote Plane_pea5434.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, The Pokémon Company said it would now begin an audit of all Pokémon TCG Pocket cards to ensure it had not provided fan artwork as a reference for any other previous cards. By highlighting the similar design of Buzzwole now, fans hope that The Pokémon Company will take note sooner — and either replace the artwork or credit the original creator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After internal review, we discovered that the card production team provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards," The Pokémon Company wrote in a statement. "As a result, both cards have been replaced with a temporary placeholder that the team is actively working to replace with new artwork as soon as it's ready."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, the game's immersive Ho-Oh EX card and its sister Lugia EX card (which also features the Ho-Oh design in its animation) simply feature no artwork, and instead include awkward-looking "New Art Coming Soon" placeholder text. It will be interesting to see if Buzzwole EX ends up getting similar treatment, or if The Pokémon Company decides its design can be considered different enough. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Subsequently, The Pokémon Company doubled down on its explanation that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pokmon-company-calls-on-fans-to-stop-attacking-or-slandering-illustrator-embroiled-in-tcg-pocket-plagiarism-scandal">its own processes had been fault, rather than the named illustrator on the card</a>, who had been simply following the reference material provided. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It has come to our attention that there is criticism towards the cards' illustrator circulating online," the company stated. "The illustration errors were caused by the production teams of The Pokémon Company and Creatures Inc, who provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator, and we intend to take full responsibility for it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
