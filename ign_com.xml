            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re one of the Nintendo fans who worried the company lost its creative spark after playing it fairly safe with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a>, let me introduce you to Drag x Drive: a wheelchair basketball-inspired sports game that’s controlled almost entirely with the Joy-Con 2’s mouse mode. True, it’s surprisingly drab in personality considering it comes from the company that’s brought us some of the most iconic characters and worlds in gaming, but even after 20 years of playing every bizarre motion-controlled game from the Wii on down, I can safely say this is something I’ve never seen before. Perhaps more surprising to hear, I actually really like how Drag x Drive plays. I respect the ambition to try something entirely new, even though I recognize the result is definitely not going to be for everyone. But despite its surprisingly good gameplay, Drag x Drive is pretty disappointing in terms of the content outside of its three-on-three online matches, with a lack of variety and enticing unlockables you’d expect from a game like this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the look of it, the main reason this game exists is to showcase the Joy-Con 2’s combination of built-in mouse and motion controls. The separated left and right controllers direct your baller’s left and right arm, respectively; you can slide the controller on a flat surface to have your arm push your wheels forward and backward, lift and flick your wrist after you line yourself up with the hoop to shoot the ball, and wave to a teammate to signal that you’re open for a pass. Drag x Drive plays like a more hardcore version of a game in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/14/wii-sports-review">Wii Sports</a> series: it’s less pick-up-and-play, with more advanced techniques to master and the added demand of constantly sliding your controllers around. If you hate Wii-era motion controls or any game that leaves your arms and wrists a little bit tired after extended play sessions, you should probably stay far away from this one.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Drag X Drive Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For the first hour or so, it didn’t feel natural. It demands a lot of actions a game has never asked of me before: usually games like Wii Sports rely on simple controls paired with automatic movement, but Drag x Drive puts you in complete control of your character, and I just wasn’t used to it. And when things weren’t going well, like when my opponent kept scoring and I hadn’t yet learned how to stop it, the physicality of it all made for a steeper, more frustrating learning curve than just remembering which buttons to press on a traditional controller (an option that is entirely absent here).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But as I practiced further, I started to really enjoy the way Drag x Drive plays. Once I absorbed the idea, I started comfortably gliding around the lone arena that combines a traditional basketball court with skate park elements, stealing the ball from opponents and then dunking it after doing a flip off a halfpipe. Drag x Drive’s skill ceiling feels surprisingly high, and I can see a hardcore group really latching onto its systems. The mid-match action is very polished as well, with rock-solid performance and cool haptic feedback where you can feel the click of your wheels in the controllers.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s generally very responsive, if<em> </em>you have a proper surface to play on.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s generally very responsive, too, <em>if </em>you have a proper surface to play on. That’s a big “if” – never before have I had to undergo so many wardrobe changes to figure out which pants were ideal to wear when playing a video game. Nintendo says you can use your legs for the mouse controls, but the results really varied depending on if I was wearing jeans, pajama bottoms, cotton sweatpants, or athletic shorts, which ended up working the best. Any texture, wrinkles, or folds impacted motion accuracy, and if I wasn’t sitting with my legs perfectly flat like a tabletop, it sometimes wouldn’t register that I was trying to move at all. It takes some work to achieve the best position to play, but once I found it, the controls did work significantly better than I expected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you have the option, though, don’t use your lap. Drag x Drive easily worked the best when playing in my office on my desktop PC monitor, which is where I settled after finding that leaning over a living room coffee table wasn’t comfortable enough either. I simply moved my keyboard aside and had the entire flat surface of my desk to slam the Joy-Con 2 on over and over (I will say, the idea of being this rough with controllers that keep going up in price made me feel a little uneasy).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you manage to get past those initial road blocks, you can start learning some neat tricks to score bonus points. You can pull off a bunny hop as you shoot the ball to score an extra tenth of a point – which is a leap you perform by grabbing your wheels and lifting both controllers up in quick succession. A flashy 540-degree turn that leads into a two-handed slam dunk is worth .4 extra points, and it’s really satisfying trying to get an opening to pull off these risky, advanced techniques – and I had multiple games come down to a fraction of a point difference. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Defense is pretty fun, too: you need to slam into a ball-handling opponent head-on to knock it loose, literally put your hands in the air to try and block a shot, or quickly snag a rebound to regain possession. I learned how important it is to hit the brakes to stop directly in front of an opponent and get up in their face. It accurately replicates the intensity and excitement of a close pickup game, with great moments like grabbing a rebound and driving all the way down the court for an open three, or throwing up a last-second buzzer beater, complete with a dramatic slow motion effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You <em>can</em> play offline with bots that are decently smart and always pass you the ball if you signal that you’re open, but the action excels when you take it online with five friends or strangers. It’s fun to coordinate with teammates over GameChat to set them up for an open shot or decide who to guard on defense – and like most competitive multiplayer games of this nature, there’s really no reason to play offline.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, outside of the arena, Drag x Drive doesn’t have much going on. The whole affair takes place in what’s called the Park, which has about as much personality as its one-word name implies. It has the same color palette and atmosphere you’d expect from a mall parking lot, with gray concrete everywhere, faint, forgettable music off in the distance, and nobody around (unless you’re playing online, where up to 12 people can join a Park together). Scattered around are a small handful of fun time-based challenges, like racing through obstacle courses, jumping rope 100 times in a row, or scoring as many points as possible, but after reaching the target time for most of them in just a couple of hours, I was left wishing there were more challenges to complete. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan Ranks Every First-Party Switch 2 Game</h3><p>Follow this list for my ranking of every Nintendo-published Switch 2 game from the very start of the generation.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One neat idea is that if you’re playing in an online lobby and roaming around the Park trying out challenges at your own pace, a giant video board displays live updates of who has the highest scores in each one. Some challenges award gold rings to the record-holder so everyone wheeling around the park can see who’s the champ. Both features encourage friendly competition if you all buy into it, and I can see this being a decently fun place to hang out with a group of friends as everyone tries to set new high scores in between matches. There are also group minigames to break things up, though those amount to a 30-second race or a sprint to see who can grab the ball first. They’re both pretty skippable, and fortunately, you can easily opt out of participating and just wait for the real game to begin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big issue holding Drag x Drive back is that there’s just not that much reason to do anything. Earning trophies by winning games and completing challenges unlocks new helmet designs for your character, but that’s pretty much the only unlockable, and the customization options honestly aren’t that exciting when it’s all just helmets with one or two minor differences, like bunny ears or a spiky hairdo. There’s no leveling up, no meaningful achievements, and nothing to work toward that makes me want to boot up Drag x Drive when I could be playing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splatoon-3-multiplayer-review">Splatoon</a>, or another competitive multiplayer game. I don’t necessarily think a game <em>needs</em> this stuff to be fun, but after 10 hours, I’m skeptical I’ll have much reason to come back outside of friend hangouts. And that’s only if my friends put in the time to click with the gameplay like I have.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s a shame that gameplay I genuinely like is wrapped in such a boring, one-note package.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even things like a varied soundtrack, multiple court designs, or original characters with personalities (like in Arms and Splatoon) would go a long way here, but instead it all just feels like the bare minimum. It’s incredibly generic, and it’s a shame that gameplay I genuinely like is wrapped in such a boring, one-note package. That’s not usually Nintendo’s style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also has to be said that it’s ironic how, in a game that’s clearly based on wheelchair basketball, there’s no option to play with anything but these physically demanding motion controls, and the settings to adjust how they work are extremely limited. It’s not exactly a poster child for accessibility in video games.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Drag x Drive controls like nothing else I’ve ever played, and it asks a lot of you in order to get used to its complicated mouse and motion mechanics. Obviously, if you don't like (or literally can’t use) forced motion controls like this, then you should steer clear. But once I put in the time to "get good," I really enjoyed the surprisingly deep fundamentals of Nintendo's unique take on wheelchair basketball. Its online three-on-three matches are a lot of fun, and it has some good ideas for provoking friendly competition between rounds that I wish were fleshed out a little bit more. That lack of substance is the most disappointing part about Drag x Drive, with little in the way of unlockables, customization, personality, and variety. I imagine a hardcore group of fans could rally around it, because its movement is very cool and there is a ton of potential to discover in its exciting trick system – but with a high initial barrier to entry and not enough reasons to stick around for the long haul once you’ve cleared it, it’s hard to see Drag x Drive establishing itself among an already crowded field of online multiplayer options.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/drag-x-drive-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We are not retconning what we have done in the past."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> development team has answered fan questions on the future of the franchise's modern day storyline, as well as various lingering plot threads left unanswered in the series' recent blockbuster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows is designed as something of a soft reboot for the series, with no playable modern day section and a strong focus on the real-life historical elements found in its version of feudal Japan. Little mention is made of events from previous games — something that ensures new players don't feel like they need to head to Wikipedia and catch up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's story reintroduces the Assassins and Templars slowly, and makes no mention of Basim — a major character seen within Assassin's Creed Valhalla and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> whose fate is left open-ended. The Isu, Assassin's Creed's mysterious precursor race, meanwhile do not play a part at all — following a string of games where the hunt for one of their artefacts acted as the main macguffin. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, during a fan Q&amp;A on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1mo3rmj/hi_were_simon_andr%C3%A9_and_luc_developers_on/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, the game's development team has answered questions regarding whether the series will deliver more modern day storyline in the future, whether we'll see Basim again, and which of the game's current crossovers are canon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With AC Shadows we are putting in place the first stone of new means to deliver the modern day storyline with the Animus Hub," wrote level design director Luc Plante. "That is not the end of it, and we are listening to your feedback."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, fans can unlock snippets of text logs that tell a fresh story featuring various Assassin and Templar units in what seems to be the near future. So, technically, rather than the "modern day", this storytelling time period now appears to be a number of decades ahead (and something that conveniently means ongoing plot threads like the character of Basim can be moved past).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But will fans get more of Basim's story? Valhalla's ending left the character's future wide open, with many fans expecting him to appear again in a prominent role. Mirage, which tells the story of his origins, meanwhile once featured a bizarre post-credits scene hinting at more from the game set to come. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have complex new characters that were introduced in Shadows that we didn't feel there would have been enough spotlight for Basim as well," Plante continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Basim's story be picked up in Shadows? It seems unlikely. The character feels too far removed from the game's Japanese storyline, and it's easy to see why Ubisoft did not have a place for him in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, it's worth remembering that Ubisoft declined to comment earlier this year on a report in a French newspaper that stated the company was now working on new content for Mirage, following an injection of funding from Saudi Arabia's controversial Public Investment Fund. Perhaps this, if and when it arrives, will be used to wrap up Basim's narrative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The AC lore is very complex and keep expending as we are creating new games," Plante said, when asked why events in the franchise's expanded universe of games and comics were not mentioned specifically within Shadows. "We are not retconning what we have done in the past, but we do not necessarily mention everything in every game if it doesn't directly support the narrative we are building. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has taken a similar approach to the Isu, who remained off-screen within the game. Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Valhalla leant heavily into their settings' mythological elements. Shadows, however, treated (almost) everything without the need for a supernatural or sci-fi explanation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Similar to this, the fact that there is no Isu artifact in the main game of Shadows doesn't mean that it doesn't exist in the world of Shadows," Plante said, "it just wasn't a story device that we needed for the story we wanted to tell." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of supernatural elements, Plante confirmed Shadows' unlockable Dead by Daylight content was "not canon to the story of Shadows." That said, the recent Critical Role crossover with the new character of Rufino <em>is</em> canon, and tied into the game's main themes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-expansion-claws-of-awaji-release-date-revealed">Assassin's Creed Shadows is the game's big Claws of Awaji expansion</a>, due on September 16. Alongside a fresh region to explore, the add-on will expand on Shadows' current ending with new story for Naoe and Yasuke. Maybe the Isu are lurking somewhere within it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

This is due to longer than expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voiceovers, console certification, and other launch preparations. We sincerely apologize for not being able to meet the originally promised fourth quarter launch schedule. Please kindly understand that this is a strategic decision aimed at insuring success on a meaningful scale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The release date has been internally confirmed for Q1 2026," the statement concluded. "However, given the change in launch timing, we will announce the date at a more appropriate time based on business considerations, rather than making an announcement at Gamescom next week.
