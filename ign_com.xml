If you're a <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5bV5d?object_uuid=859e3d11-fa8f-48f6-a799-694898694ee9&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart+</a> member, there's a 5-hour early access that starts <strong>12 PM ET on Monday, November 25. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If it doesn't sell out within that time, it'll be live at 5 PM ET for everyone else.

We'll endeavor to update you when the deal is live, and if retailers like Best Buy and Target price match the offer as well.</p><div catalogid="d43fd930-1c94-4160-a6ed-07908b619be2" id="211474"><div id="211474" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Should You Sign Up for Walmart+ Before Nov. 25?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While one of the standout deals in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-walmart-early-black-friday-deals-2024">Walmart’s first wave of Black Friday offers</a> is a 50% discount on a 12-month Walmart+ membership, it's still probably not worth signing up just to snag a single deal. You’d likely be better off purchasing the game at Target for $40. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, consider whether early access to Walmart’s upcoming deals or the other benefits of a 12-month membership makes sense for you. Take some time to weigh the value of the subscription against your shopping habits to decide if it’s the right choice.</p></div><div catalogid="ffb2807f-13c0-4d38-a85c-dc765656ace1" id="210375"><div id="210375" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Walmart+ 12-Month Membership</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Can't Wait? Tears of the Kingdom is $39.99 at Target Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like we said, if you can't wait, or as a backup, Tears of the Kingdom is $39.99 at Target for Black Friday from today onwards. It's is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-games-2">best games on Nintendo Switch</a>, and the sequel to Breath of the Wild brings new areas to explore in the clouds and depths below the surface, offering what feels like a brand-new take on Hyrule. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It begins one year after Breath of the Wild. One day, while exploring under Hyrule Castle, Princess Zelda and Link discover a mummy that comes alive, shattering the Master Sword and wounding Link. When he awakens, Link finds himself on the Great Sky Island, one of the many floating islands in the sky. Here, the many mysteries of the ancient Zonai tribe are revealed.</p></div><div catalogid="ddb149a2-d46b-4935-838f-af1cd363d65f" id="211385"><div id="211385" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">What We Said in Our Review</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">our 10/10 review</a>, we said Tears of the Kingdom "is an unfathomable follow-up to one of the greatest games ever made, somehow improving upon it in nearly every way – be that with simple quality-of-life improvements, a genuinely exciting story, or wildly creative new building mechanics that make you rethink what is possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It both revamps old ground and introduces vast new areas so immense it somehow makes me wonder if Breath of the Wild was actually all that big, with an almost alarming number of tasks to complete, mysteries to discover, and delightful distractions to keep you from ever reaching that place you naively thought you were headed. Nintendo has followed up a triumph with a triumph, expanding and evolving a world that already felt full beyond expectation and raising the bar ever higher into the clouds."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Black Friday Game Deals We've Found So Far</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual date of<strong> </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024"><strong>Black Friday</strong></a><strong> in 2024 falls on November 29</strong>, but the holiday deals season starts a lot earlier than that.

It’s like they took FromSoftware’s signature challenge and sprinkled in some explosive mech mayhem, because why not?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game’s story sends you to Rubicon 3, a contaminated wasteland where corporations and resistance groups are locked in a brutal battle to control a mysterious, catastrophic energy source. As a mercenary caught in the middle, it’s up to you to outfit your mech with the perfect loadout and dive into missions that require brains, brawn, and a little button-mashing finesse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Armored Core VI, it’s not just about blowing things up (though there’s plenty of that). The customization options let you create a mech that reflects your playstyle, whether precision strikes from afar or close-quarters carnage. Add a visually stunning world and epic boss battles, and you’ve got a recipe for hours of adrenaline-fueled fun. Let's not forget Armoured Core being pretty much a Soulsborne franchise but with mechs, so get good!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve been itching to join the mech party, now’s your chance. At $19.99 you’re not just saving $40, you’re scoring a ticket to one of the most exciting games in the genre. Don’t wait too long, though.
