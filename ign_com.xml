            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-call-for-change-to-going-first-mechanic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"One advantage, however, is that you can concede faster."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> adapts the beloved card game into a speedier experience more fit for mobile, but players can't get their heads around one rule change regarding going first and are calling on developer Creatures Inc. to change it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At its simplest, the Pokémon TCG works by players attaching energy to their Pokémon to do attacks, with more energy resulting in bigger damage dealt. Pokémon are eventually knocked out and, once a certain number are defeated, someone wins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Card games commonly apply nerfs to the player who goes first so they don't gain an unfair advantage over what's essentially a coin toss, and the Pokémon TCG is no different. The player going first draws a card and can attach a single energy to a Pokémon, as normal, though isn't allowed to attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This balances things out a touch as, while player two is the first to attack and therefore do damage, player one can swing back the following turn with two energy and a bigger attack. But Pokémon TCG changes this mechanic by only allowing a card draw on the first turn, making the entire thing, some players believe, completely redundant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As we seem to all acknowledge going first in this game feels awful, and don't get me started about the one energy evolutions which benefit off going first," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gm5u0x/going_1st_sucks/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> user Seedler420 said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Can't we trade the possibility of attacking turn one, which in terms of gameplay doesn't make any sense, with the possibility of attaching energy turn one? This way the player going first would have energy advantage while the player going second would have the first attack."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The way Pokémon TCG Pocket works essentially gives the advantage to the player going second, as they have both the energy advantage and the first damage advantage. "It would feel a little better if we at least got to put energy on a card first turn," said one player in the comments. "It definitely feels bad," said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. did ask for feedback when it announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-passes-30-million-downloads-in-9-days">more than 30 million players had downloaded the game in just nine days</a>, so perhaps if enough people complain a change will come about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived October 30 as a streamlined and has players opening packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collecting cards</a>, building decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battling others;</a> a simple formula that immediately proved popular given it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">$12 million in four days</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. is keeping busy since launch as it has already added three events to the game: one focused on collecting, one focused on solo battles, and one focused on player versus player battles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first offers players a free Wonder Pick with the chance of pulling either a Meowth or Chansey alongside event tickets and Wonder Hourglasses, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-adds-new-rewards-and-missions-to-wonder-pick-event">its second part also released today</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, the solo battle event <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">let players take on a handful of water themed decks</a> for the chance of winning new promo cards including Lapras ex. And a PVP event was later added too, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gets-first-pvp-event-today">putting badges on the line in true Pokémon fashion</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you'd expect, players are looking to take the best decks into these events, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Mewtwo and Charizard are naturally dominating so far</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-it-should-have-done-user-testing-and-internal-evaluation-earlier-on-concord<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has reflected on the disastrous launch of PlayStation 5 game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, saying it’s still learning when it comes to live service games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord, a live service hero shooter from Sony-owned Firewalk Studios, has gone down as one of the biggest flops in PlayStation history. Amid disastrously low player numbers, Sony hauled Concord offline just two weeks after launch. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown"><u>It eventually shuttered Firewalk and confirmed Concord wouldn’t return</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has proved a costly failure for Sony. Concord's initial development deal was around $200 million according to a report by <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kotaku</u></a>, which cited two sources familiar with the agreement. They said the $200 million was not enough to fund Concord's entire development, nor did it include the purchase of the Concord IP rights or Firewalk Studios itself. Kotaku's number aligns with an <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/sony-acquires-video-game-studio/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>earlier report</u></a> saying that ProbablyMonsters — Firewalk's original parent company — raised $200 million in 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all points to Concord being seen as an ambitious project that was expected to attract a large audience. Instead it launched to tepid reviews and low interest, prompting PlayStation to pull the plug within days of release. One estimate suggested it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"><u>only sold around 25,000 copies</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Midia Research analyst Rhys Elliott told IGN shortly before Concord was shut down: “Pivoting to live services is high-risk, high-reward venture, and the risk is heightening to levels that might not be worth it for many AAA console/PC publishers that aren’t already active in the space."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Concord Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent financial call, Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki said the company has learned lessons from both the record-breaking launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> earlier this year and Concord’s failure. On Concord specifically, Totoki said Sony should have run its development gates such as user testing or internal evaluation “much earlier than we did.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Currently we are still in the process of learning,” Totoki said. “Basically, with regards to new IP, of course you don’t know the result until you actually try it. So for our reflection, probably we need to have a lot of gates, including user testing or internal evaluation, and the timing of such gates, we need to bring them forward. We should have done those gates much earlier than we did.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The suggestion here from Totoki is that Sony should have noticed and reacted to Concord’s issues earlier in the development process, presumably so that it could have improved the game before launch.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/gettyimages-2153633660-1731080199508.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki. Soichiro Koriyama/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Totoki then went on to point fingers at Sony’s “siloed organization” and Concord’s release window, which may have caused cannibalisation. Concord launched in August, not long after smash hit Black Myth: Wukong hit PS5 and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have a siloed organization, so going beyond the boundaries of those organizations in terms of development and also sales, I think that could have been much smoother,” Totoki said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then going forward, in our own titles and in third-party titles, we do have many different windows. And we want to be able to select the right and optimal window so that we can deploy them on our own platform without cannibalisation, so that we can maximize our performance in terms of title launches. That’s all I have.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Concord launched into the ultra competitive live service hero shooter market following the failure of Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which contributed to a $200 million hit to publisher Warner Bros.’ revenue.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Helldivers 2 was a huge hit, while Concord ended up being shut down. We gained a lot of experience and learned a lot from both.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Sony senior vice president for finance and IR Sadahiko Hayakawa compared the launches of Helldivers 2 and Concord, saying lessons learned would be shared throughout the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We launched two live-service games this year,” he said. “Helldivers 2 was a huge hit, while Concord ended up being shut down. We gained a lot of experience and learned a lot from both.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We intend to share the lessons learned from our successes and failures across our studios, including in the areas of title development management as well as the process of continually adding expanded content and scaling the service after its release so as to strengthen our development management system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We intend to build on an optimum title portfolio during the current mid-range plan period that combines single-player games — which are our strengths and which have a higher predictability of becoming hits due to our proven IP — with live-service games that pursue upside while taking on a certain amount of risk upon release.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s live service push has seen mixed results so far. Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with an incredible 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, but other live service games have fallen by the wayside. In December last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward">Naughty Dog canceled a live service The Last of Us multiplayer game</a> and announced plans to focus on single-player games. Sony-owned developer Bungie, meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio">has suffered significant layoffs as a result of Destiny 2’s struggles</a>. The failure of Concord and the closure of Firewalk is yet another troubling development for PlayStation live service.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to the future, a number of PlayStation live service games remain in the works, including Bungie’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, Guerrilla’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">Horizon Online</a>, and Haven Studio’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgame$</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-what-we-create-is-more-important-than-the-amount-spent-on-development<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"The more you polish something that has never existed before, the more value it brings."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent Q&amp;A</a> with investors, Nintendo executive and storied designer Shigeru Miyamoto answered a question about the trend of rising development costs, saying that what Nintendo creates is far more important than what it spends on development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question related to rising development costs, asking if Nintendo's own expenses would increase in the future and if the company could mitigate those increases. Miyamoto stepped in to respond first, saying that while cost increases are inevitable, and Nintendo is focused on creating good and unique experiences first, it's also quite possible to make great games without spending massive piles of money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's his response, in full:</p><blockquote>Our research and development expenses have been increasing each year. Since our scale of development has grown, a corresponding increase in costs is, in some respects, inevitable.</blockquote><blockquote>However, our belief is that what we create is more important than the amount spent on development. We continue refining our products until we are confident that we have created something that our consumers will be satisfied with. With that in mind, what is important is to find ideas that are worth honing, and this has not changed since the era of Nintendo Entertainment System. Everyone has different interests, so we cannot make sweeping statements about what ideas are worth pursuing. However, one thing we are sure about is that it should be something which has not existed in the past. The more you polish something that has never existed before, the more value it brings. We believe that it is important to nurture developers who take this unique concept to heart, allocate funds to development if necessary, and release games only after we are confident in the product – and repeat this process over and over again.</blockquote><blockquote>On the other hand, in the entertainment business it is possible to create appealing products based on intriguing ideas, without incurring significant costs. Children’s toys are a prime example of this. We believe that not all products require large costs. Even in the case of video games, with the current technology it is possible to create fun games with a small number of developers in a short period of time. We believe it is important not to lose sight of this perspective.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/gettyimages-2173872596-1731077735788.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto.

Takahashi reiterated the importance of "unique titles that are small in scale" that can be expanded, rather than spending huge amounts of money. He added that the Switch has evolved in such a way that it includes different methods to limit cost increases. And Shiota added that the company is working hard to ensure developers can work efficiently, and that "bigger budgets do not necessarily equate to better ideas." Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa threw in at the end that investment in development is a necessity - otherwise Nintendo won't have great hardware and software at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same Q&amp;A, Miyamoto <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendos-shigeru-miyamoto-creator-of-mario-zelda-donkey-kong-and-more-denies-being-a-genius">dismissed a question</a> referring to him as a "genius", saying new Nintendo employees had referred to the Mario, Zelda, and Pikmin creator as "surprisingly normal" after meeting him.
