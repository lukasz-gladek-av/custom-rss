            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A surprise continuation for the Rebel Moon universe is here.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zack-snyders-rebel-moon-is-apparently-getting-a-ridiculous-scale-video-game-adaptation">Blood Line</a>, a video game spinoff for Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon, finally launched today as the Netflix movie series it’s based on remains with an uncertain future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Subscribers may have been surprised to see Blood Line: A Rebel Moon Game show up as a playable game on their mobile devices today. Developed by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate studio Super Evil Mega Corp, this spinoff of the sci-fi universe that Snyder kicked off in 2023 allows players to drop into the Rebel Moon universe with isometric, twin-stick shooter gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Take on intense combat missions in this multiplayer action game,” an official description for Blood Line says. “Build a rebellion against the Motherworld and fight for your planet’s freedom.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With friends or alone, Blood Line tells a standalone story completely separate from the tale spun in Rebel Moon parts 1 and 2. What’s more is that Netflix Games and Super Evil Mega Corp <a href="https://www.rebelmoongame.com/features/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>promise</u></a> their video game spinoff will “expand and evolve across regular post-launch updates.” With more challenges and rewards yet to be revealed, Blood Line’s future seems much more secure than the film series it originates from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rebel Moon: Part 1 – A Child of Fire set the stage for a new world from Snyder when it premiered in late 2023. After propping it up as a big-budget sci-fi epic with lots of moving parts, Rebel Moon Part 1 failed to impress, scoring a 22% from critics and 56% from fans on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rebel_moon_part_1_a_child_of_fire" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rotten Tomatoes</u></a> (we gave it a 4/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-part-one-review-netflix-zack-snyder"><u>our review</u></a>). Rebel Moon: Part 2 – The Scargiver attempted to get the new universe back on track upon its release in April 2024 but faced a similar landing with a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rebel_moon_part_two_the_scargiver" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>16% from critics and 47% from fans</u></a> (we also gave it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-part-two-the-scargiver-review-netflix-zack-snyder"><u>a 4/10</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Snyder Cut versions of both Rebel Moon films eventually made their way to Netflix in August 2024 and received <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rebel_moon_part_one_directors_cut" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>more positive reviews from audiences</u></a>, but Netflix has been quiet about how the story may continue. Snyder spoke about his work with Netflix during a recent interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/rebel-moon-video-game-zack-snyder-film-franchise-superman-1236453663/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Variety</u></a>. While Rebel Moon and its characters remain on the Man of Steel director’s mind, it sounds like he’s got other projects he’ll be tackling first.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I got sidetracked into this — not sidetracked, it’s all uptown problems, as they say — for Netflix, I’m working on an LAPD SWAT movie,” Snyder said. “So I was like, OK, well, I’m gonna just sort of let that Rebel Moon world boil for a minute, and I’m gonna go do this. And frankly, it was a very exhausting, long process doing the two movies together. So it was nice to have a bit of a break from it. I love it like crazy, but it’s nice to have a bit of a break. So yeah, we’ll see after I finish this, when I come back, where we are with everything.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Snyder adds that there are “tons of stories” to tell from the Rebel Moon, but he still needs to determine how the universe could expand, “if at all.” While we wait to see how Blood Line might continue to build on Snyder's world, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-star-says-negative-reviews-zack-snyder-movie-really-affected-her">how the negative reviews affected Rebel Moon star Sofia Boutella</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">From the creators of Rick &amp; Morty, with added talking guns </h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever your sense of humor I'd wager a giant pickle that you can't make it through an hour of playing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/high-on-life">High On Life</a> without at least a childish snigger. The Squanch Games shooter is back on Xbox Game Pass today, so there's really no excuse not to test out that theory. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Conceived in the brain of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/rick-morty">Rick &amp; Morty</a> creator Justin Roiland, it's a time honored tale of an alien invasion, bounty hunting missions, sentient weaponry, and a wannabe drummer called Globo who has a butt for a face. Roiland lends his vocal chords to your main gun, Kenny, who chats to you as you explore different planets and take on different enemies. It's essentially "what if Morty spat bullets and had something to say about every little move I made?" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave High On Life game an 8 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/high-on-life-review">our review</a>, and called it "an irreverent, absurd shooter that manages to shine with its outrageous humor, silly setting and story, and some really goofy, foul-mouthed guns that pull the whole thing together for the vast majority of the time. " When it was first on Xbox Game Pass originally in 2022, it became the biggest Xbox Game Pass release of that year.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">High on Life: Meet the Talking Guns</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are what Kenny describes as "classic, text book, puzzle situations," or "simple platforming… like in Mario Land" parts, but the true joy comes from the inane dialogue and jokes that are hitting you from everywhere. The storyline takes weird tangents, henchmen hanging around in the background and chat, and your selection of talking weapons never shut up. One of them - my favorite, whose ammunition is the bodies of his newborn children - is even voiced by comedian Tim Robinson from I Think You Should Leave and A24's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/friendship">Friendship</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He'll say  typical line from Knifey might be "I'm in heaven right now, I'm ripping through his tendons like they're butter," or a dying Carebear type creature with its intestines hanging out will beg you to stay until it dies, then fake you out until Kenny begs you to shoot him. NPCs chat about killing their wives and kids so they won't miss them, or who  on the team might be into sexual torture. There's a section in an Applebees, a gun called Lezduit who talks like Sylvester Stallone, a kid who taunts you to kill him - "I look so shootable" while Kenny begs you not to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, just try it. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/high-on-life-2">High on Life 2</a> was just announced this summer and is supposed to be out by this winter, so you'll want to catch up with the story before then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial.
