Let's get straight into todays deals:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Sign Up for Walmart+ For MSRP Pokémon TCG</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Want to make sure you get one of these on the day? Well the max buy limit is 5, and Walmart+ is half price until 2nd December, so it's the perfect time to get signed up and make sure you're ready for tommorow, 13th November at  4 pm PT / 7 pm ET (or five hours before for Walmart+ members). One things for sure, 8 booster packs for $24.99 is a great deal in this climate.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Xbox Early Black Friday Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">These deals are Black Friday level bargains. $60 off an Elite Series 2 Core controller? Bargain. A cheeky 512GB of extra storage for $10 and change off? Believe it. Even if you don't have an Xbox, the Xbox Controller, Fire Stick and Game Pass Ultimate bundles are heavily discounted too.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">PlayStation 5 Early Black Friday Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can actually buy a PS5 Pro for around the same price as a standard Xbox Series X right now, let that sink in. Already got a PlayStation 5? Some of the best games on the console are marked down right now. Even newer releases such as Rise of the Ronin is down to $44.70. Don't miss out on these early Black Friday deals.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Electric Scooter Deals Starting at $109</h2><div catalogid="36a3b9f5-2ced-42c2-8fd0-f4fa3b4e7cdd" id="228099"><div id="228099" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LADPED LP60 350W Folding Electric Scooter </h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Scooters have some major advantages over bikes. They're lighter, more compact, and usually less expensive. Electric assisted scooters give you more range and speed for less effort, and the brushless motor is pretty quiet. You'd think upgrading to one would cost you a lot of money, but that doesn't have to be the case. AliExpress is offering a couple of well-regarded electric scooters at prices you probably didn't expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can pick up a <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxqBp?object_uuid=eeaeeb8c-4c25-4e72-993c-aba4f092166f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LADPED LP80</a> 350W electric scooter for just $127 with coupon code "<strong>AEUS26</strong>".

Both scooters ship free from a local US warehouse; since they've already been shipped from overseas, any tariffs have already been paid for and you don't need to worry about them. AliExpress marketplace vendor AOVOPRO is an authorized reseller of these scooters and has plenty of reviews and sales to back up its reputation.</p></div><p id="60-off-samsung-s90d-65"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="60% off Samsung S90D 65" and="">60% off Samsung S90D 65" and 77"</h2></p><div><div id="230277" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>65" Samsung S90D 4K OLED Smart TV</h3></p></div><div id="230278" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>77" Samsung S90D 4K OLED Smart TV</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">144hz refresh rate screams gaming TV to me, especially when it's on a quantum dot OLED screen. That 144hz refresh rate is supported on all four of its HDMI 2.1 ports, which is insane. There's no worries about getting the best performance from your Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and even gaming PCs.</p><p id="msi-vector-hx-16"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MSI Vector HX 16" amd="" ryzen="">MSI Vector HX 16" AMD Ryzen 9 8940HX RTX 5070 Ti Gaming Laptop</h2></p><div catalogid="217899fe-95e3-424b-9754-79344b27a39a" id="230279"><div id="230279" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MSI Vector HX 16" AMD Ryzen 9 8940HX RTX 5070 Ti Gaming Laptop</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With a processor that's built for performance and outperforms Intel Core i9-1400HX, we're off to a good start with this RTX 5070Ti gaming laptop. 32GB DDR5 Ram is higher end too, clocked at 6400MHz and has a tidy 1TB M.2 SSD, both of which can be upgraded at anytime. Topping this build with a 240Hz QHD screen and you're laughing at this price point.</p></div><p id="samsung-p9-512gb-microsd-express-car"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Samsung P9 512GB MicroSD Express Car">Samsung P9 512GB MicroSD Express Card</h2></p><div catalogid="217899fe-95e3-424b-9754-79344b27a39a" id="230280"><div id="230280" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Compatible</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Samsung P9 512GB MicroSD Express Card</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst this is one of the cheaper options for a Switch 2 Micro SD Express card, there's cheaper. The problem is with cheaper cards is the lower transfer speeds, which add up on more demanding games. Getting a Samsung P9 ensures 800MB/s, with Samsung having a great reputation for storage products in general.</p></div><p id="asrock-steel-legend-radeon-rx-9070-x"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="ASRock Steel Legend Radeon RX 9070 X">ASRock Steel Legend Radeon RX 9070 XT</h2></p><div catalogid="217899fe-95e3-424b-9754-79344b27a39a" id="230281"><div id="230281" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>16GB GDDR6 PCI Express 5.0 x16</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>ASRock Steel Legend Radeon RX 9070 XT</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Want something that performs around the same as a RTX 5070Ti without the price tag to go with it? AMD is slowly clawing back its GPU market share by targeting mid-range gamers, but the RX 9070 XT is a brilliant graphics card. Whilst I can run something like Oblivion Remastered at 4K 60FPS all day long on it, I get a lot more joy from it playing at 1440P and getting twice the frame rate instead. This is well worth the money if you're in the market for a new GPU.</p></div><p id="ibuypower-y40-pro-rtx-5080-gaming-pc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="iBuypower Y40 Pro RTX 5080 Gaming PC">iBuypower Y40 Pro RTX 5080 Gaming PC</h2></p><div catalogid="217899fe-95e3-424b-9754-79344b27a39a" id="230282"><div id="230282" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>AMD Ryzen 9 7900X, 32GB DDR5 RAM, 2TB M.2 SSD</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>iBuypower Y40 Pro RTX 5080 Gaming PC</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">RTX 5080 has claimed it place as the sweet spot on the Nvidia 5000 series GPU lineup. It'll play anything in 4K with dedicated ray tracing support, and has DLSS4 technology to insert AI frames and resolution upgrades to fall back on. Ryzen 9 7900X is also a solid processor to back up the 5080, with a max turbo of 5.6GHz and rocking 12 cores, 24 threads and 64mb of L2 cache. Long story short?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> is set to receive what could be its biggest update yet, including reverted aim assist and additional weapon bloom tweaks, as soon as November 18, as work on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-roadmap-revealed-heres-what-to-expect"><u>Season 1</u></a> continues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios outlined the past, present, and future of its Battlefield 6 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-redsec">REDSEC</a> post-launch plans in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/updates-ahead-of-california-resistance" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an update posted online</u></a> today. It comes with a list of headlines for ongoing issues players can expect to see addressed when Season 1’s next chapter, California Resistance, launches November 18, as well as some of the content set to arrive with Winter Offensive come December 9.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For our teams across Battlefield Studios, this is just the start,” a message from the team says. “We’ve been watching, reading, listening, and we’re hard at work on how we will evolve the experiences for you all. We’re focused, fired up, and getting it done because Battlefield has always been at its best when we build it together, as we have done on our journey through Battlefield Labs, our Open Beta, launch and the current Season 1.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios has teased that the Battlefield 6 California Offensive update will bring a new map, called Eastwood, alongside new weapons and a new mode. We now know the mid-season update will also tackle five key elements across the experience: Weapon dispersion/bloom, lighting adjustments, challenge clarity, Fort Lyndon in Portal, and aim assist.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Weapon dispersion and weapon bloom remain one of the hottest topics among Battlefield 6 players online, as they affect each weapon’s accuracy depending on a variety of in-game factors. BF Studios says it’s made a “small tuning pass that reduces how quickly dispersion and recoil build up during sustained fire.” These tweaks apply to all weapons, with most also benefiting from recoil refinements, with the developers hoping players’ weapons “feel smoother and more consistent, especially at longer ranges” going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lighting and visibility changes target soldier visibility, while challenge requirements, something BF Studios <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-major-overhaul-of-challenges-and-assignments-with-significant-reductions-to-challenge-requirements-available-now">already began tackling in a recent update</a>, should be clearer starting with the November 18 update for Battlefield 6. Portal players can also expect to take advantage of more from Fort Lyndon as they continue building out their ideal Battlefield 6 maps and modes. As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-to-revert-aim-assist-settings-as-pc-players-edit-files-to-turn-off-crossplay">promised</a>, aim assist settings will also be reverted to fall more in line with what players experienced during the open beta tests a few months back.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve adjusted Aim Assist to make aiming feel smoother and more predictable, helping players build stronger muscle memory,” a message from the team says. “Tuning is now similar to the Open Beta experience. As a result, Infantry Aim Assist and Infantry Aim Assist Slowdown have been reset to match the new values, so try the update before making changes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 is set to receive major changes when California Resistance launches November 18, but the December 9 update could also deliver some game-changing adjustments. Vehicle balance tweaks are one thing BF Studios has planned for next month, with fixes for some Breakthrough and Rush maps also on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, while no concrete plans are in the pipeline yet, BF Studios has outlined a number of community talking points that it is looking into for Battlefield 6 and REDSEC. These include additional challenge adjustments, UI and menu improvements, player stats, social play, hit registration/netcode, the overall vehicle experience, and, yes, even map sizes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have seen your comments about map size and pacing. Battlefield is at its best when maps offer different ways to play and constant action around every corner. Striking that balance is always a priority, and we are committed to a variety of map types across future Seasons. With Eastwood arriving in the California Resistance Update, we will continue monitoring existing maps and modes for targeted adjustments (like what’s planned in <em>Winter Offensive</em>) while also learning from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-is-brilliant-battlefield-6-players-flock-to-giant-fan-made-conquest-maps-as-map-size-debate-rages-on">community creations in Portal</a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Portal players have famously used the community tools it offers to build not only wacky creations but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-map-debate-reaches-new-level-as-players-meticulously-measure-70-maps-from-bf3-bf2042-and-more">some of the bigger maps players are looking for</a>, too. IGN recently spoke with creative director Thomas Andersson about the future of Portal, and we learned that BF Studios has more in store when it comes to fleshing out that mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There’s always been the plan to add features and add new content as we go to Portal and make that available for people to create new, impressive experiences,” Andersson said. “The stuff they’ve created so far is just mind-blowing, some of it. It’s like, ‘Oh, how do you guys think of this?’ It’s crazy. It’s been a joy to watch, and I think it will keep getting better and better as they get more comfortable with the tools, as we give them even more things to play with.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A number of topical REDSEC elements are also under review, including audio performance, a casual battle royale mode, armor plating, and tank availability. Another option BF Studios is looking into revolves around a solo battle royale experience and how such an option could work for Battlefield 6 and its battle royale offshoot.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’re just getting started, and there’s more to come," BF Studios' message signs off. "Following the <em>California Resistance Update</em> on November 18, <em>Winter Offensive</em> arrives December 9, with <em>Season 2</em> launching in early 2026. Thank you for continuing to shape the future of Battlefield with us."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Battlefield 6 and what’s to come with Season 1, you can read more from our interview, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/keep-your-ear-to-the-ground-battlefield-6-devs-hear-the-cries-for-battle-royale-solo-queue-in-redsec">more insight into what solos could look like</a>, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-respond-to-redsec-review-bombing-this-is-just-the-beginning-of-the-experience">the team’s response to the recent REDSEC review-bombing campaign</a>.
