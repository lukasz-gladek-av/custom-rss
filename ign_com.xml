Thankfully, Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/27/a-great-new-price-for-playstation-vr2/?sf276497679=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced just yesterday</a> that the company would be dropping the recommended retail price of the headset down to $399.99. This price cut brings it more in line with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3 line</a>, which is currently $499 for the Quest 3 and $299 for the Quest 3S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're hoping to pick up the PlayStation VR2 headset for yourself at this new price, now you can! Retailers have already started adopting the price cut and you can purchase the PSVR2 Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle for just $399.99 at Target.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/beyond-game-club-revisiting-batman-arkham-asylum<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Welcome to Beyond! Game Club, a new segment for podcast Beyond! where each month we will be picking games to play as a group and talking about our experiences as we progress through them. The games will range from various classics to quintessential PlayStation games we consider must plays, and even revisiting some recent favorites to prepare for upcoming sequels (looking at you Ghost of Tsushima and Yotei)! However, for March we decided it would be a great time to revisit one of our favorite superhero games of all time: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/09/11/batman-arkham-asylum-review">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been at least 10 years since many of us dove into 2009's Batman: Arkham Asylum and now feels like the perfect time to revisit the game that almost singlehandedly revitalized the superhero genre. Whether it was the excellent freeform combat of snapping back and forth between enemies with precision, to unleashing devastating kicks or takedowns, or the way it trained our detective skills to solve the numerous riddles by the Riddler – Arkham Asylum gave us the best depiction (for its time) of Batman and what it would be like to wear the cowl.  
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Beyond! team is eager to dive back into this amazing game, and over the month of March we will be talking about it weekly on each episode of the podcast as well as updating this column with our thoughts and hope that you will all do the same in the comments below.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/streamer-secures-full-combo-for-the-most-infamous-guitar-hero-song-at-200-speed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Clone Hero streamer and content creator CarnyJared has completed a full combo (FC) for DragonForce’s infamous <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/guitar-hero-iii-legends-of-rock"><u>Guitar Hero 3</u></a> song Through the Fire and Flames — at 200% speed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The streamer's description of the event says it all: “IT. IS. OVER.” Posted yesterday, February 27, is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhV9b0CiAtU&amp;t=5s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recorded evidence</a> of the unbelievable feat and world record CarnyJared managed to pull off while streaming. As he launches into his final, successful attempt at hitting all 3,722 notes without missing a beat, on-screen text reminds viewers that this grand finale is the result of nine months of practicing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I am rightfully thankful for everybody that has supported me throughout this ridiculous grind. I have the best supporters on the entire platform of Twitch and YouTube,” CarnyJared explains in the video’s description.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We all spent an unfathomable amount of time staring at the same 3,722 notes, figuring out any possible way to hit them more efficiently. Somehow it worked out, and somehow I am able to sit in front of this computer which you have all cumulatively provided to me, and make a living playing Clone Hero.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— CarnyJared (@CarnyJared) <a href="https://twitter.com/CarnyJared/status/1895007995852951808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Through the Fire and Flames running at regular speed can be a lot to process for the untrained eye, so watching CarnyJared blaze through the song at 200% speed feels completely incomprehensible. There’s not much else to say; FCing a seven-and-a-half-minute song in just over three minutes is extremely impressive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Achieving an FC on the open-source Guitar Hero-like known as Clone Hero requires playing a song in its entirety without missing a single note. On-screen stats in the streamer’s video reveal that he’s reached nearly 2,000 FC runs past the song's first bridge, only 662 past its second bridge, and 227 to its solo section. The Through the Fire and Flames 200% FC you see today marks only the fourth time CarnyJared has managed to pass the solo.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is a moment that will live with me forever.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“I am blessed every single day to wake up and have food in the kitchen, and a place to sleep because of you amazing group of people,” CarnyJared adds. “And I also thank my family, who has not only supported me my whole life, but they all specifically watched and supported this entire grind at my lowest and highest points. This is a moment that will live with me forever.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He called the Through the Fire and Flames 200% FC the “hardest thing” he’s ever done in his life, so the celebration that follows his successful run tracks with the effort he’s put into completing it throughout the last nine months. For those interested in seeing how such an inhuman achievement can be accomplished in the world of Guitar Hero and Clone Hero, CarnyJared teased that fans can expect a “1 hour+” documentary in the next few months.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CarnyJared?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#CarnyJared</a> CarnyJared full combos Through The Fire and Flames on 200% speed <a href="https://t.co/bscIumlvhy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/bscIumlvhy</a></p>— Livestream Fails (@LSF_Forwarder) <a href="https://twitter.com/LSF_Forwarder/status/1895045223983591471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">For more on how the Guitar Hero community is keeping the game alive, you can watch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crkd-reveals-its-new-guitar-controller-and-how-it-builds-on-guitar-heros-legacy-ign-fan-fest-2025"><u>music game streamer Acai test out CRKD’s new guitar controller</u></a> in Fortnite Festival as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/fanfest">IGN Fan Fest 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-charges-for-character-edit-vouchers-again-and-players-are-frustrated<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is out and millions of players are making their hunters. It might be worth spending some extra time in the character creator though, as frequent extensive edits can run up a tab.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Character Edit Vouchers make a return in Monster Hunter Wilds (as pointed out by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/monster-hunter-wilds-locks-character-editing-behind-microtransactions/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a>), adding a microtransaction for returning to the creator screen. While smaller edits to your character — say, hair color or voice pitch — won't consume a voucher, more extensive edits <em>will </em>require a voucher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You can edit hair, eyebrow color, facial hair, makeup and clothing from the Appearance Menu in tent without using a voucher," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3289620/Monster_Hunter_Wilds__Character_Edit_Voucher_ThreeVoucher_Pack/?curator_clanid=44795648" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">description on the Steam page states</a>. More extensive edits, anywhere from changing the actual voice to swapping from a male to female hunter, will however eat up one voucher.</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom is handing out one free voucher for players, but anything beyond that will require purchasing a new one. The same rules apply to your Palico, which will also need a voucher for any extensive edits. The vouchers are sold in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">various denominations</a>, including three-packs for character edits at $6.99 and a bundled Character &amp; Palico Edit Voucher three-pack for $9.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that this is not the first time Monster Hunter has had this particular microtransaction. Both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/861870/Monster_Hunter_World__Character_Edit_Voucher_Single_Voucher/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monster Hunter World</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1798007/MONSTER_HUNTER_RISE__One_Character_Edit_Voucher/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monster Hunter Rise</a> had their own Character Edit Vouchers. That's not to say they're a particularly beloved facet of the series, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/s42q17/character_edit_vouchers_are_a_total_scam_and/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monster Hunter subreddit thread from three years ago</a> lamented the Vouchers in Monster Hunter Rise, for example. "Worst part of gen 5 for sure," one user replied at the time. "I hate the introduction of completely unnecessary [microtransactions]."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even in the days leading up to Monster Hunter Wilds' launch, players voiced disdain for this system. As <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1it8xfg/probably_no_one_cares_but_capcom_for_the_love_of/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some in a recent thread noted</a>, other games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> offer character edits for free, and an unlimited amount. With Capcom's current system, there's a hard cap to how many times a player can return to the creator and edit their hunter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"On top of having to pay in MH, there's a hard limit where you can never customise that character again once you've used all the available vouchers. What purpose does this serve?" <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1it8xfg/probably_no_one_cares_but_capcom_for_the_love_of/mdmvmju/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one player asked</a>. "When I return to a game I haven't played for a while I like to change my character's looks to keep it fresh, but I just don't bother in Monster Hunter and whack a helmet on lmao."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The system itself is fairly reminiscent of some MMOs where making a "new character" might require an additional sub or added cost. Yet the Voucher system has been a routine point of frustration, to the point that some PC players have found ways to get around it with mods.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">All Low Rank Armor in Monster Hunter Wilds</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Users also left negative feedback in the Steam reviews for Character Edit Vouchers for both Monster Hunter World and Rise. Even the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3289630/Monster_Hunter_Wilds__Character_Edit_Voucher_Single_Voucher_Free_Trial_Version/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Character Edit Voucher - Free Trial Version</a> for Monster Hunter Wilds has garnered nearly 200 reviews as of the time of writing, sitting at a "Mixed" overall rating. On the negative side, the complaints seem clear: "It's not ideal, but I can live with cosmetics 'DLC', but limiting character edits is a bit much, should be free and unlimited."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the rebuttal, the positive reviews stress how little the Vouchers impact the game itself: "The amount of people that will never actually read, or actually use the in-game feature that allows this shocks me. But then again, it's the internet here we're talking about."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The whole kerfuffle feels reminiscent of Dragon's Dogma 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-breaks-capcom-steam-records-amid-microtransactions-furore">where a legion of microtransactions rolled out at launch and immediately garnered frustration</a>. Those particular exchanges offered in-game goods; ones still acquireable through gameplay means, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragons-dogma-2-mods-undercut-capcoms-controversial-microtransactions-dish-out-infinite-save-slots">players still found ways to work around them anyways</a>. In the case of Monster Hunter Wilds, there's one free Edit Voucher, and everything after has to be bought out-of-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It remains to be seen how the community will react to this, long-term. Monster Hunter Wilds is only just now getting into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-nears-1-million-peak-concurrent-players-on-steam-and-its-only-going-to-get-bigger-from-here">many, many people's hands</a>, and I do think that other concerns like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review">difficulty</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-mixed-steam-user-review-rating-capcom-issues-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-troubleshooting-guide">PC performance</a> will take precedence over microtransactions, especially since these aren't a <em>new</em> problem. Whether they remain a problem, or players learn to live with — or work around — the Voucher limit, we'll see in the coming weeks and months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help get your Monster Hunter Wilds adventure started, take a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Things_Monster_Hunter_Wilds_Doesn%27t_Tell_You_-_Tips">what Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t tell you</a>, and a guide to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Weapons">all 14 weapon types</a> in the game.

We said: “Monster Hunter Wilds continues to smooth off the rougher corners of the series in smart ways, making for some extremely fun fights but also lacking any real challenge.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
