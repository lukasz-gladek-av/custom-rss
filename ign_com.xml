            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Liz Albl, the new BioShock game's narrative lead, has now joined Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher studio CD Projekt Red.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The move follows <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-studio-cloud-chamber-undergoes-layoffs-appoints-rod-fergusson-new-bioshock-head">2K's recent decision to "rework" development of its long-gestating BioShock 4 project</a>, which has been in development now since at least 2018. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Albl joined Cloud Chamber, 2K's secretive studio tasked with building a fresh BioShock chapter, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-writer-joins-bioshock-4-as-narrative-lead">back in 2022</a>. Now, an update on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liz-albl-80772353/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> makes clear that the former narrative boss departed the company back in August — at the time <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-reportedly-getting-a-narrative-overhaul-amid-development-struggles">2K indicated it was unhappy with progress and announced layoffs</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Work on the next BioShock game has been underway for several years," noted an email to Cloud Chamber staff sent at the time by 2K president David Ismailer, and obtained by IGN. "While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> report confirmed that Cloud Chamber Games studio head Kelley Gilmore had been removed, amid other layoffs, while creative director Hogarth de la Plante had been shuffled into a publishing role. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The timing of Albl's departure from the studio in August also makes sense, then, and it was reported at the time that 2K Games had been particularly critical of issues with the game's narrative. BioShock 4's story is now expected to be overhauled, and development will be overseen by former Gears of War head and Diablo franchise lead Rod Fergusson, who 2K has installed as the new overall boss of both Cloud Chamber and the BioShock franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prior to Cloud Chamber, Albl had served two years at Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor studio Monolith Productions working on Warner Bros.' now-cancelled Wonder Woman game. Prior to that, Albl had worked for several years at PlayStation's Sucker Punch studio writing Ghost of Tsushima, and at Ubisoft working on the Far Cry and Watch Dogs franchises.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Little is known about the next BioShock game, though sporadic hints from job descriptions and other possible leaks have suggested it will be set in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-setting-rapture-columbia-job-listings">brand new location</a>, and feature <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-bioshock-game-hiring-writer-for-open-world-setting">open world elements</a>. When IGN last <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question">asked Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick about the game's progress</a>, he reassured that BioShock 4 was "going to come out" for certain, but could not say when.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for BioShock's original creator Ken Levine, there's little new word on his own long-awaited next project — the BioShock-esque Judas. Despite previously being <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-story-games-judas-is-currently-planned-for-release-by-march-2025">expected by March 2025</a>, we've not had a fresh update now in a little while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

With another free gift and more cosmetics in rotation, Battlefield 6 fans hoping to see more grounded skins were happy to find The 323 pack cosmetic pack brings exactly the kind of customization options they were looking for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yes DICE, these are the skins we want!" one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1p07qbh/yes_dice_these_are_the_skins_we_want/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popular Reddit post</a> says. The downside, though, is players will have to cough up some serious cash if they want to wear them.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6 The 323 Skin Pack Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Four American soldiers from different walks of life suddenly find themselves as the only defense when Pax Armata assaults the town of Eastwood,” a description for Battlefield 6’s The 323 skin pack says. “This guerrilla unit makes do with anything on hand, and clears through urban conflict block by block.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For 2,400 Battlefield Coins, or $24 USD, you get the Class skins seen above, as well as access to the 323 unit and a few other cosmetics. There is an in-game bundle option to purchase 2,400 Battlefield Coins for $19.99, but it’s far from enough to stop players from dropping their jaws as they see how much these otherwise well-received skins cost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Obviously the most beautiful (and appropriate) ones are paid for, and on the battle pass they put the colored fluorescent ones that can see you at 100km,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1p0exuj/comment/npia0iw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>popular comment</u></a> says. “Rascals!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s s**t like this that makes me realize I am not the target audience of this game,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1p0exuj/comment/npiditm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another</u></a> adds. “I’m the wrong kind of financially irresponsible to pay for garbage like this lol.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The goofy skin debate has been nearly inescapable since Battlefield 6 launched for PC and consoles on October 10. It’s a movement that has seen vocal fans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-battlefield-6-players-hate-this-season-1-skin-so-much-theyre-threatening-not-to-revive-anyone-who-uses-it">calling out some of the more vibrant infantry skins</a> in the hope of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-battlefield-6s-commitment-to-gritty-realism-activision-makes-shock-call-of-duty-change-for-black-ops-7-we-hear-the-feedback">warding off the controversial outfits seen in other shooters like Call of Duty</a>.

As fears of goofy skins have mounted, so too have comments from select players who declared they would pay for high-quality grounded skins should they ever come to multiplayer. Now that The 323 pack is here with a high price tag and pages are dominated by dissatisfaction, other Battlefield 6 fans have been quick to fire back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That’s what y’all were asking for lol,” one Reddit user said. “Can’t even count the number of post where people said they would be willing to just give money for grounded skins rather than do challenges or if dice added grounded skins in the shop they would give them money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Also tired of people acting like theirs no grounded skin options, legit every launch skin (I guess other than the mastery skins because of the orange lol) are grounded.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another user replied: “Maybe if they were a reasonable price, sure. But a $20+ bundle? In a game we already paid $70+ for?”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Battlefield 6 players continue to work out their disagreements about cosmetics, others are diving into the content introduced in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-1120-patch-notes-include-aim-assist-tweaks-and-bloom-adjustments-as-season-1-continues">today’s 1.1.2.0 update</a>.
