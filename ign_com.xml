            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">New gameplay footage of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> has teased a glimpse at a fresh area in the game filled with classic zombies — and it all looks very Resident Evil 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The snippet comes from a special Resident Evil program that aired recently on Japanese TV, shared online by long-time Capcom leaker DuskGolem. Within the footage, we can see Requiem's lead character Grace Ashcroft approaching a staircase in a dimly-lit mansion, and taking aim at a shuffling zombie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ashcroft's shots miss, and the zombie lunges forward to grab the character. It looks like the undead enemy manages to gnaw her arm, before she eventually fights it off — only to find another zombie waiting for her down the corridor.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">There was some new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay of a new area with Grace fighting a zombie in the Resident Evil special program that aired on Japanese television. <a href="https://t.co/FToPeqi4HW" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/FToPeqi4HW</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1996158141793489389?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's only a short clip, but fans are celebrating the classic Resident Evil vibe it gives off, and the setting for this gameplay segment which looks straight out of the Spencer Mansion. (It's definitely not, but still.) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, another classic element expected to appear in Resident Evil Requiem is a certain fan-favorite Leon S. Kennedy, who has been named in persistent rumors and reports as secretly appearing in the game as a second playable character. Capcom has remained tight-lipped on the matter and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-resident-evil-requiem-interview-why-the-games-monster-got-supersized-why-its-probably-not-lisa-trevor-and-a-tease-for-areas-beyond-raccoon-city-just-dont-talk-about-leon">refused to discuss Leon's involvement specifically</a>, though recently gave its biggest hint yet when it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-producer-teases-characters-involved-in-the-raccoon-city-incident-are-in-the-game">acknowledged that other classic characters connected to the Raccoon City incident would indeed appear</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has specifically pitched Resident Evil Requiem as a return not just to the classic location of Raccoon City, but also to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade-resident-evil-requiem-will-return-to-franchises-original-overarching-narrative-featuring-raccoon-city-and-umbrella">the series' "overarching narrative"</a> begun 30 years ago, after more recent games such as Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil Village focused on events set elsewhere, with fewer connections to past titles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What has Capcom got in store? Time is beginning to run short for Capcom to reveal much more, as Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
