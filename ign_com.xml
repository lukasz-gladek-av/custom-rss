            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">At least Dispatch is really good!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft was, at one point not too long ago, working on a brand new Splinter Cell game. But it morphed over time to become XDefiant, according to a new report.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzE0MzM2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNzQ4MTY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVFBMDdHUEZIUlYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.fNOncm0D1BfbWI9RAgwCB6j8SI8mW9RhRD76EEz1TYo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg story about AdHoc Studio</a>, the developers of workplace superhero comedy game Dispatch, which describes their journey from Telltale Games to Ubisoft to their own independent studio. The leadership of AdHoc began working together at Telltale Games, working on Tales from the Borderlands, before Nick Herma, Dennis Lenart, and Pierre Shorette departed for Ubisoft in 2017. There, the trio worked on a new entry in the Splinter Cell franchise.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it’s been dormant for a while,” Herman told Bloomberg. “And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, they explain that Ubisoft was beginning to push games as a service hard across its portfolio, and Splinter Cell didn't quite fit that mould. Over time, the Splinter Cell project transformed into what would become xDefiant, a free-to-play first-person shooter that launched to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xdefiant-review">middling reviews</a> last year and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">shut down just this past June, taking two entire studios with it</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trio eventually reunited with Michael Choung, another former colleague from Telltale, to start AdHoc Studio in 2018. While working on a version of what would eventually become Dispatch, they also took on a scriptwriting co-dev gig on The Wolf Among Us 2, only to pull out of the project after writing an 800-page script due to frustrations with a lack of creative control. That project, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/telltale-games-has-allegedly-laid-off-most-of-its-workers">last we heard of it</a>, seemed similarly ill-fated.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, though, the group was able to pull together the final version of Dispatch with the support of both a publisher and a number of well-known actors thanks to casting director Linda Lamontagne. A last-minute deal with Critical Role for another game helped get them across the finish line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Splinter Cell, fans remain bereft of a new game, with the last new Splinter Cell title being Blacklist from way, way back in 2013. There's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-very-early-look-at-splinter-cell-remake">allegedly a remake of the original 2002 game in the works</a>, but Ubisoft has been so quiet about it since 2022 that it's hard to say whether or not it will ever fully emerge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dispatch, meanwhile, is excellent. We're <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-review">working on a review in progress</a> as each episode comes out, but you can read our thoughts on the first two episodes here for now, where our reviewer says they're "totally enthralled in this world, and I’m keen to get tangled up in Robert’s fractured personal life."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering is getting yet another big Secret Lair collab with a major video game series, and this time it's Monster Hunter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/bastion-uk/pressreleases/wizards-of-the-coast-and-capcom-r-announce-magic-the-gathering-r-secret-lair-x-monster-hunter-superdrop-3416433" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Announced today</a> in a very odd press release, the Monster Hunter Secret Lair Superdrop will be available from December 1 at 9am PT to December 22 at 11:59pm PT, but only while supplies last, and these things tend to sell out pretty quick.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The collaboration includes four separate drops, each priced at $29.99, with a foil edition for $39.99. All cards involved are reprints of existing cards with Monster Hunter themes, nothing mechanically unique or new. The press release includes some basic information about each of the drops, titled respectively The Hunt, The Hunters, The Monsters, and The Monsters II, but no card images as of yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Hunt</strong> focuses on non-creature spells, themed around "the terrifying attacks that monsters across the Monster Hunter franchise can unleash." There is one spell of each color:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1x Blind Obedience: Malzeno from <em>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</em></li><li>1x Snap: Kushala Daora from <em>Monster Hunter 2</em></li><li>1x Village Rites: Magnamalo and Tobi-Kadachi from <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></li><li>1x Mizzium Mortars: Yian Garuga from <em>Monster Hunter Generations</em> and <em>Monster Hunter 2</em></li><li>1x Tooth and Nail: Azure Rathalos and Seregios from <em>Monster Hunter 4</em></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Hunters</strong> is, as it sounds, about the hunters themselves, with each card depicting a different set of armor and weapons and having the human creature subtype. As before, there's one spell of each color:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1x Grand Abolisher: Tigrex Armor with Bone Scythes from Monster Hunter Generations and Monster Hunter Freedom 2</li><li>1x Archaeomancer: Velkhana Armor with Slinger and Winged Seraphyd Greatsword from Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</li><li>1x Grim Haruspex: Nargacuga Armor with a Hidden Eye Light Bowgun from Monster Hunter P2G/MHFU</li><li>1x Imperial Recruiter: Rathalos Armor with Red Tigrex Claws; Brachydios Armor with Burning Knocker; Gore Malaga Armor and Royal Rose from Monster Hunter 4G</li><li>1x Champion of Lambholt: Astalos Armor with Verdant Lightning Shield from Monster Hunter Generations.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Monsters </strong>and <strong>The Monsters II</strong> are similarly self-explanatory, including the following monsters as legendary creatures. These are two different sets, but the press release is unclear exactly how these nine creatures will be split between them. IGN has reached out to Wizards of the Coast for comment on this and just generally on the confusing nature of this press release:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nezahal, Primal Tide: Lagiacrus from Monster Hunter 3</li><li>Drakuseth, Maw of Flames: Rathalos from Monster Hunter Generations</li><li>Sarulf, Realm Eater: Zinogre from Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate</li><li>Vaevictis Asmadi, the Dire: Nergigante from Monster Hunter World</li><li>Ziatora, the Incinerator: Fatalis from Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</li><li>Razaketh, the Foulblooded: The Gore Malaga from Monster Hunter 4</li><li>Amareth, the Lustrous: Velkhana from Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</li><li>Wasitora, Nekorus Queen: Nargacuga from Monster Hunter Portable 2nd Generation/Monster Hunter Freedom Unite</li><li>Kalamax, the Stormsire: Brachydios from Monster Hunter 3 Generations</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Card in the Avatar: The Last Airbender Beginner Box - Magic: The Gathering</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a busy year for both Secret Lair and third-party Magic collabs in general, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-lair-release-full-release-schedule-2025">some incredible Secret Lair card drops</a> including Sonic, Final Fantasy, Deadpool, SpongeBob, The Office and more. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-full-release-schedule-2025">We're currently eagerly awaiting</a> the release of the Avatar: The Last Airbender Universes Beyond set, following close on the heels of Marvel's Spider-Man. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-full-release-schedule-2026">Next year is looking equally stacked</a>, with planned Universes Beyond sets featuring TMNT, The Hobbit, Marvel, and Star Trek. It's too many cards. Please, slow down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social. Got a story tip?
