However, one thing that Nintendo has been suspiciously quiet about is the technical prowess of its new handheld. While we have clear upgrades like new Joy-Cons, a redesigned kickstand, and a larger form factor, we still have no official word on just how powerful the Switch 2 is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But does the brief glimpse at Mario Kart 9 in the reveal video provide clues? In <a href="https://youtu.be/4I6iydbep2M?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new YouTube video</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/indie-developer-behind-the-last-wii-u-and-3ds-games-says-switch-2-mario-kart-textures-are-extremely-telling-that-this-system-is-significantly-more-powerful-than-the-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesRadar</u></a>), indie developer Jerrel Dulay of Sungrand Studios said that he expects the Switch 2 to be much more powerful than the original console. Dulay is credited as being one of the last developers to work on titles for the Wii U and 3DS, and is intimately familiar with Nintendo hardware.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Kart 9 - First Look</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dulay explained that the new Mario Kart footage in the Switch 2 trailer could give us a glimpse at exactly what the Switch 2 may be capable of. He first noted the presence of “physically-based shaders” on cars and other textures. These shaders can be applied to objects and can be affected by reflections, lighting, or other effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In late 2023, Digital Foundry published an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-inside-nvidias-latest-hardware-for-nintendo-what-is-the-t239-processor" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>extensive report</u></a> on the Switch 2’s new hardware, which allegedly includes the Nvidia T239 ARM mobile chip. The T239 chip reportedly inside the Switch 2 is projected to have 1536 CUDA Cores (these cores can process shaders), 40% fewer than the desktop variant of the RTX 3050 GPU, which is on the same 8nm Nvidia Ampere architecture. This was corroborated by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-df-weekly-what-does-the-switch-2-motherboard-leak-say-about-system-performance" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Switch 2’s motherboard leaks</u></a>, which showed a potential 8nm chip.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Nintendo Switch’s Tegra X1 chip possessed just 256 CUDA cores, marking a 500% increase in pure availability of CUDA core count alone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Every single piece of geometry I see here is using physically-based rendering for the shaders,” Dulay explained. He noted that using complex shaders on the original Nintendo Switch was demanding for the hardware, and using many of them could cause framerates to plummet. Dulay added that the Mario Kart footage also shows off additional material reflections from the ground, his face, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dulay pointed to the high-resolution ground textures used throughout the footage, saying: “ground textures, because they take up so much space, they are something that will have to be high-resolution." He went on to explain how high-resolution textures also demand available RAM.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Nintendo Switch has just 4GB of RAM to run games and its OS, whereas the Nintendo Switch 2 is rumored to have 12GB of RAM. The Switch 2 motherboard leak showed off two SK Hynix LPDDR5 modules, which could offer up to 12GB of RAM, with each chip offering 6GB each.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We currently don’t know the specific speed of the RAM modules, which could offer significant increases in efficiency compared to the original Switch’s 1600MHz while docked. A similar part from RAM manufacturer SK Hynix can run at speeds up to 7500MHz, increasing the amount of available bandwidth for the RAM pool significantly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means that things such as texture loading could be much faster, allowing for the new Mario Kart to use high-resolution textures. “It’s not that they’re just high-resolution, but there’s a high number of unique textures being used," Dulay added. The potential higher memory transfer rate paired with the pure RAM storage increase could lead to significantly prettier Switch 2 titles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dulay further stated that the Mario Kart teaser also includes “true volumetric lighting," which is taxing for any GPU to run. “It takes into account the distance, the height, you can have certain areas be more dense, you can have light rays."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Dulay, the Switch 2’s display of volumetric lighting in the new Mario Kart title is indicative of just how powerful the Switch 2 could be: “it tells me that the Switch 2 is significantly more powerful, because they want these games running at 60 frames a second."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is a massive deal, this is the most important part of the reveal trailer to me,” Dulay further commented, explaining that implementing volumetric lighting was a significant challenge for developers on the original Nintendo Switch. He also noted the presence of shadows at far distances in the trailer. “Shadows are quite expensive to calculate and draw," he said, as developers on the original Switch needed to cull the level of detail distances at which shadows were drawn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, with the compounding of the Switch 2’s power through the use of its CUDA cores, RAM capacity, and speed, it seems like those difficulties have been significantly reduced thanks to the new console’s raw power.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dulay pointed out how the number of textures onscreen, high poly-count characters, in addition to the real-time cloth physics on the flagpoles demonstrate just how much of a leap in power the Switch 2 will be for developers used to making games on Nintendo’s 2017 console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we wait for more details and footage from the Nintendo Switch 2, Dulay’s video offers a unique insight into what you should expect in terms of graphical power from the new Nintendo console.

The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name">announcement of a new Nintendo console</a>. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tiktok-is-back-online-in-the-us-after-being-officially-banned-on-january-18">death and resurrection of TikTok</a>. And now, a new Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2 release date theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This one (believe it or not there are more than a few GTA 6 theories doing the rounds) was sparked into life by <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1879925333790539845" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another seemingly innocuous GTA Online promo tweet by Rockstar Games</a>. “Claim a free Vapid Dominator GT muscle car and more with GTA+,” the tweet reads. “Members also earn bonuses on Priority FIB Files and Terrorbyte Client Missions, save with Arcade Property discounts, and much more.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What information-starved GTA fans were most interested in, however, was the accompanying image, which includes a shot of a metal shipping container with a series of numbers printed on its side. One number is singled out with a slightly enlarged font and a rectangle around it: 2.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/21/gta-main-1737468480158.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The numbers Mason, what do they mean?! Image credit: Rockstar Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s all it took for eagle-eyed obsessives to set off on yet another GTA 6 theory brainstorm. The 2 must be a reference to GTA 6 Trailer 2, right? But what if you add up all the other numbers? Does that mean anything?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">X/Twitter account <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Plus" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@GTA6Plus</a> did the math and came up with the number 30. "They made sure to include the numbers in the post," GTA6Plus insisted. "They have to mean something." January 30, 2025 for the GTA 6 Trailer 2 reveal?</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">They made sure to include the numbers in the post. They have to mean something. <a href="https://t.co/icQSlVp11g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/icQSlVp11g</a></p>— GTA 6+ (@GTA6Plus) <a href="https://twitter.com/GTA6Plus/status/1880056599752188121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">There’s more to this theory. It turns out the release dates for both Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto V were announced on a Thursday. January 30, 2025 is a Thursday. Coincidence?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have also pointed out that Rockstar parent company Take-Two is set to release its next set of financial results on February 6, so a release date announcement as part of a new trailer beforehand might make sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve been here before, of course. Multiple times. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-rockstar-officially-unveils-first-trailer-early-after-leak"><u>Rockstar released GTA 6 Trailer 1 to record-breaking viewership</u></a> in December 2023, but it hasn’t released a single asset in the 13 months since. The year-long wait for more information has fueled increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories about when Rockstar will release GTA 6 Trailer 2. These have included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/on-the-gta-6-trailers-1-year-anniversary-fans-are-debating-youtube-playlist-updates-and-batting-away-misleading-ai-generated-images"><u>counting the holes in Lucia’s cell door net</u></a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/were-now-at-the-bullet-holes-and-braille-stage-of-gta-6-fan-theory"><u>bullet holes in the car from Trailer 1</u></a>, and even analyzing registration plates. But chief among the conspiracy theories is GTA 6’s ongoing moon watch, which was, remarkably, proven to have accurately predicted the date Rockstar announced when it would release GTA 6 Trailer 1 last December, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-community-devastated-by-gta-6-trailer-announcement-no-show-after-moon-theory-proved-incorrect"><u>debunked as a hint at the release date for Trailer 2</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crazy? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-could-easily-announce-the-gta-6-trailer-2-release-date-but-its-staying-quiet-on-purpose-because-its-a-really-good-marketing-tactic-ex-dev-says">One former developer at Rockstar recently expressed his delight at the many wild conspiracy theories surrounding GTA 6</a>, insisting staff at the studio will be enjoying watching the community go off the deep end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It <em>is</em> remarkable that Rockstar has gone a year without following up GTA 6 Trailer 1 with any new information at all. With GTA 6's fall 2025 release window on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S still on the cards, according to Take-Two, you’d expect Rockstar to pipe up sooner rather than later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you wait to find out, IGN has much more on GTA 6 to check out, including an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, the boss of Take-Two's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response"><u>coy response on whether GTA 6 is coming to PC</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
