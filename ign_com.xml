The songbook includes songs from the entirety of the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time's iconic library of music and comes with easy to understand instructions for first-time ocarina players, as well as real sheet music for more experienced musicians. There's also a quick visual guide on how to hold the ocarina properly before playing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is widely agreed to be one of the greatest video games ever made, and its soundtrack from legendary composer Koji Kondo is big reason for that.

Like you probably are right now, I was a bit skeptical about how good the recipes could be from a Pac-Man-themed cookbook, but authors Lisa Kingsley and Jennifer Peterson — wait for it — <em>cooked</em>.<strong> </strong>The 160-page hardcover book features over 60 delicious recipes that are easy to make in the comfort of your own home. This is the perfect companion for when you're hosting a game night or having a video game-themed watch party of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">industry's biggest events</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this latest cookbook may seem a bit strange, there are actually a <em>lot</em> of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-cookbooks">video game cookbooks already out there</a>. It's actually surprising it took this long for Pac-Man to get in on the action.</p><p id="pac-man-the-official-cookbook"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pac-Man: The Official Cookbook">Get the Pac-Man: The Official Cookbook on Amazon</h2></p><div catalogid="967c2dac-ccec-43fc-a71a-3a6ea661802b" id="220793"><div id="220793" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pac-Man: The Official Cookbook</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's filled with a wide variety of recipes, from healthy quick bites to full meals for the family. Each recipe comes complete with easy-to-follow instructions and crisp full-color photographs to show off the finished product. As you'd expect, many of them are fun and creative nods to Pac-Man's long history. You can make a pepperoni pizza in the iconic shape of Pac-Man, turn Blinky into a hearty tomato soup, whip up some sweet cherry pocket pies, and even make eerily accurate Ghost cake pops. Personally, the smash burger recipe has my attention. Pick up Pac-Man: The Official Cookbook now for just $30 to level up your cooking skills and try something new in the kitchen. </p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pac-Man Cookbook Preview</h3></div></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Pac-Man related news, the next entry into the yellow blob's video game library is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/shadow-labyrinth-official-release-date-announcement-trailer-nintendo-direct-2025">Shadow Labyrinth</a>, a bizarre take on both the Metroidvania genre and traditional Pac-Man mechanics, based on the Secret Level episode titled Circle. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-level-review-prime-video-tim-miller">We gave Secret Level a 5 overall</a>, and in our review said "[w]ith a dubious selection of source material and indistinct styles of animation, Secret Level struggles to find satisfying stories for a short-form anthology." </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.
