            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-of-atlan-launches-may-28-and-shakes-up-mmorpg-combat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Crystal of Atlan is an action MMORPG from developer VI-Games that wants to put its own unique spin on the gameplay of the genre. It features a focus on class-based build diversity, fast-paced aerial combat, and chaining together abilities to build up your combo meter. It's available to <a href="https://coau.onelink.me/Kb3c/rqg5e02q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">download for free</a> right now, but if you're looking for more info before you dive in, we've got you. Let’s start with the classes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Diverse Class Paths for Personalized Builds</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are five base classes available at launch, all unlocked for free at the start of the game: the melee damage dealing Swordsman, ranged attacker Musketeer, magical Magister, martial artist Fighter, and summoner Puppeteer. Each class branches into specialized subclasses, with a total of 11 subclass options and more than 20 unique abilities to experiment with and tailor to your preferred style.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-image-1-1747937274930.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, the Swordsman branches into the Magiblade or Berserker. They’re both melee damage dealers, but the Magiblade adds magical abilities (which you could probably guess from the name), and the Berserker can sacrifice health to generate shields and increase power as you get closer to death. Regardless of the subclass you choose, each of the skills you unlock have individual cooldowns. You can mix and match those skills at any time, letting you come up with unique character builds and find skills that chain together well to build combos.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-puppeteer-subclass-1747937366873.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Seamless Ground-to-Air Combat Innovation</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditional MMO combat focuses on ground-based attacks with a fairly simple stand-and-attack style. Crystal of Atlan differentiates itself by including a heavy focus on the Z-axis, introducing a system that encourages you to seamlessly transition between ground and aerial combat.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-platforming-1747937405449.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can attack and dodge in mid-air, allowing you to pull off aerial combos and adding a new dimension to each battle and a level of responsiveness to moment-to-moment gameplay. You can jump to avoid attacks, then chain that into aerial combos to keep the pressure on enemies. So you’re rewarded for staying on your toes, reacting quickly, and using all your abilities to fluidly chain attacks together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That focus on ground and air combos also informs the design of Crystal of Atlan’s varied environments. All of the game’s maps, from the fantastical Wonderland to the mechanical Chrome Military Factory, have an open 3D layout to allow freedom of movement. Couple that with smooth animations and you get a combat system that’s fluid and fast-paced.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-image-2-1747937438520.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Cooperative Challenges and Social Progression</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As you might expect from an MMO, there are a variety of dungeons you can tackle with other players. You fight through packs of normal enemies before getting to the end and facing off against a boss with unique mechanics. That’s all pretty standard, but Crystal of Atlan mixes things up by requiring synchronized team coordination.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-image-3-1747937464007.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There are numerous dungeons with interaction-based mechanics that require teamwork to solve problems. Naturally, if your whole group is tackling such a dungeon for the first time, you’ll need to communicate and help each other figure out what to do. Once you’ve gotten the hang of it, you can take on a mentor role in future runs, but everyone will always need to work together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a fleet system, which is basically like guilds you’ve probably experienced in other games. It’s a key part of Crystal of Atlan's social ecosystem, allowing you to link up with friends to tackle co-op gameplay together or just hang out and chat.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Competitive PvP and Creative PvE Challenges</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re the competitive type, there are also options for PvP combat. There are 1v1 and 3v3 battles, with attributes, skill damage, and skill cooldowns balanced so there’s no competitive advantage. It’s all about skill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Crystal of Atlan is an MMO at heart, it has plenty of content for solo players too. In classic MMO style, there are hub areas where you can see lots of other players. These areas are where you’ll find quests to complete and new zones to explore.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-magiblade-subclass-1747937517467.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Adventure Mode takes you through the game’s main story, which unlocks in stages. You can tackle these stages solo, and they have a variety of different goals. Some will be focused on combat, where you need to defeat groups of enemies or take on a boss. Others introduce new elements, like requiring you to use stealth to sneak past enemies or use platforming to progress through the area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of other modes you can tackle solo or co-op. The main one is the Arena, where you can fight alone or with a partner and gradually work your way up through tiers of opponents, earning escalating rewards as you do. If you manage to get through all the tiers, you can reach the Finals for the ultimate reward.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/crystal-of-atlan-image-4-1747937545618.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To sum it all up, Crystal of Atlan is an MMORPG that mixes together classic staples of the genre with evolved gameplay to keep things fun, fast, and fluid. It launches May 28 on PC, PS5, iOS, and Android, with crossplay across all platforms. The PS5 version has an optimized HUD layout to avoid clutter and utilizes the haptic feedback of the DualSense controller. It also has a remapped UI for controller input, using a function wheel you’re probably familiar with from other games. There’s HDR support for enhanced lighting, and PSSR is enabled on the PS5 Pro for sharper visuals and more stable frame rates.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/21/crystal-of-atlan-ps5-command-wheel-1747849581064.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For more info on the world, classes, and features of Crystal of Atlan, you can check out <a href="https://coa.nvsgames.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">the official website</a>.

In a <a href="https://youtu.be/0Gs22Sn2VMU?si=edC8QP_C_CzmTl5N" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 2023 interview with IGN</a>, Bethesda development chief Todd Howard said Skyrim had sold over 60 million copies. So, we now have a potential tie for the best-selling role-playing game of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt launched in May 2015, and recently celebrated its 10-year anniversary. Here’s Adam Badowski, joint CEO of CD Projekt, on The Witcher 3 sales milestone:</p><blockquote>Without a doubt, the third part of Geralt’s adventures marks a pivotal point in our history. The game earned hundreds of awards and solidified our studio’s standing, but more importantly, it brought untold hours of adventures and emotions to millions of games the world over. I am proud to announce that since its release The Witcher 3 has sold over 60 million copies, securing a place among the bestselling video games in all history, and motivating us to carry on with intensive work on the next trilogy set in this universe.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a reference to The Witcher 4, which is currently in full production. 422 out of 730 developers at CD Projekt are working on the sequel, which won’t be out until 2027 at the earliest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Doug Cockle, the voice of Geralt, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thats-just-stupid-geralt-actor-slams-suggestion-the-witcher-4-starring-ciri-is-woke">hit back at criticism of <u>The Witcher 4</u> focusing on Ciri</a> — and told so-called fans of the franchise to "read the damn books."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's just stupid," Cockle said of the backlash against The Witcher 4, sparked due to it featuring Ciri as its protagonist for the first time instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's not woke," Cockle continued, speaking during a video published by <a href="https://youtu.be/Ufg-mhMsR7o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fall Damage</u></a>. "There's nothing woke about it. [Ciri]'s a cool character from The Witcher, and they're gonna focus on that character, and that's awesome."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-developer-cd-projekt-explains-why-it-went-with-ciri-over-continuing-with-geralt-as-protagonist"><u>Speaking exclusively to IGN ahead of The Witcher 4 reveal</u></a>, executive producer Małgorzata Mitręga said Ciri was “the very organic, logical choice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was always about her, starting from Saga when you read it in the books. She's an amazing, layered character. And of course, as a protagonist we said goodbye to Geralt previously. So this is a continuation. I guess for all of us it’s like she was meant to be. That was always her.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in February, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-have-not-modified-it-the-witcher-4-director-responds-to-speculation-cd-projekt-changed-ciris-face"><u>the director of The Witcher 4 clarified that a new video featured the same in-game model of Ciri after some had thought her face looked different</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more exclusive content on The Witcher 4, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-12-vital-trailer-details-revealed-by-cd-projekt-red"><u>a trailer breakdown</u></a> and an interview with CD Projekt where the developer explains <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-plans-to-avoid-a-cyberpunk-2077-launch-disaster-with-the-witcher-4"><u>why The Witcher 4 will avoid a Cyberpunk 2077-style launch disaster</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-4-remake-is-apparently-happening-as-voice-actor-confirms-hes-not-coming-back-for-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">That's one way to find out, I guess.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The long-rumored remake of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4">Persona 4</a> is looking very real, as a voice actor from the original Persona 4 cast says they weren't brought back for the unannounced game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yuri Lowenthal, who has voiced Yosuke Hanamura in Persona 4 and several other Persona spin-offs, posted on BlueSky earlier today that he will not be returning as Yosuke for "the Persona 4 remake."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake," said Lowenthal. "I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don’t want me to come back."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They, presumably, are Atlus, though the company has yet to officially confirm a Persona 4 remake is in the works. We have reached out to Sega/Atlus for comment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Video game actors under SAG-AFTRA are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sag-aftra-says-publishers-ai-measures-are-dangerously-incomplete-as-video-game-members-go-on-strike">still on strike</a> over issues including AI protections. While Lowenthal is a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DG1r-wDSLqp/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAG-AFTRA member</a>, it's unclear whether that played a part in casting. However, the organization continues to press for protections for its actors, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sag-aftra-says-its-still-frustratingly-far-apart-from-games-industry-bargaining-group-on-ai-protections">a March statement saying</a> they are still "frustratingly far apart" with the industry bargaining group. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, despite any official confirmation, rumors have swirled around a potential Persona 4 remake for a while. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-a-new-domain-discovery-is-getting-persona-4-fans-excited-for-a-possible-remake">domain discovery earlier this year sparked hopes</a> that a P4 remake is in the oven, and <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/persona-4-remake-reportedly-in-development-reliable-sega-leaker-wait-a-while/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leakers have teased</a> the existence of a remake before that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, with all that said, a former voice actor confirming the remake is certainly not how most would imagine this information would get out there. After the success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, a Persona 4 remake would make a fair bit of sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for when it might happen, Persona 3 Reload was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-remake-officially-announced-during-xbox-games-showcase">announced in the summer of 2023</a>, during Xbox's Game Showcase for that year. Chalk up another game to keep an eye out for during this summer's flurry of news and trailers, I suppose?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Persona news, the mobile and PC spin-off Persona 5: The Phantom X <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona5-the-phantom-x-brings-the-phantom-thieves-to-pc-and-mobile-devices-next-month">officially arrives on June 26, 2025</a>, for those looking for a bit more Persona 5 in their life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cyberpunk-2-enters-pre-production-and-yes-cd-projekt-is-officially-calling-it-cyberpunk-2-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel Cyberpunk 2 has officially entered pre-production, developer CD Projekt has confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio made the announcement as part of its latest financial results, where it said the Phantom Liberty expansion for Cyberpunk 2077 had hit an impressive 10 million copies sold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">96 of CD Projekt’s 730 developers are now working on Cyberpunk 2, it added. The majority of the staff (422) is working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv">The Witcher 4</a>, which is in full production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Several weeks ago the CD Projekt Red team responsible for the next big game set in the Cyberpunk universe completed the project’s conceptual phase," CD Projekt said. "As a result, Cyberpunk 2 – previously known under the codename Project Orion – has progressed to pre-production."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What is pre-production ? In the world of AAA development, pre-production can involve everything from fleshing out concepts to planning full production, building prototypes to staffing up studios. It can often take years to complete.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an investor call following the release of the company's financial report, CD Projekt co-CEO Michał Nowakowski responded to the suggestion Cyberpunk 2 won't release until late 2030 or even early 2031, and Nowakowski failed to rule that release window out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can reiterate in a way what I said in one of the previous calls, which was basically that our journey from pre-production to final release takes four to five years on average," Nowakowski said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Having said that, keep in mind that each project is unique, and there are many variables that influence the final outcome. So I will not lead you into specific years, but yes, this is pretty much how it looks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2 still sounds a long way off, then. Indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-the-witcher-4-be-targeting-the-ps6-and-next-gen-xbox-given-it-wont-be-out-until-2027-at-the-earliest">so does The Witcher 4</a>. But we at least now know what CD Projekt is calling the game, after it was referred to previously as its codename, Orion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We know next to nothing about Cyberpunk 2, but earlier this month <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-has-night-city-and-another-city-that-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong-mike-pondsmith-teases">Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith teased some previously unknown details</a>. Pondsmith, who worked closely with CD Projekt on the 30 million-selling Cyberpunk 2077 and was involved in promoting the game ahead of its 2020 launch, was asked about the scope of his involvement with Orion at the Digital Dragons 2025 conference.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Responding, Pondsmith admitted he wasn’t as involved this time around, but said he does review scripts and had been to CD Projekt to check out the ongoing work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Last week I was wandering around talking to different departments, and seeing what they had, ‘Oh look, this is the new cyberware, what do you think?’ ‘Oh yeah, that’s pretty good, that works here.’ "</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/28/gsc9ih5xeaag1w8-1748448149834.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">96 developers at CD Projekt are working on Cyberpunk 2. Image credit: CD Projekt.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, the morsel on the sequel: that it features a brand new city in addition to the Night City we know from Cyberpunk 2077. Pondsmith described this new city as “like Chicago gone wrong.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place in Orion, because there’s another city we visit — I’m not telling you any more than that but there’s another city we visit. And Night City is still there. But I remember looking at it and going, yeah I understand the feel you’re going for this, and this really does work. And it doesn’t feel like Blade Runner, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong. I said, ‘Yeah, I can see this working.'”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth pointing out that Pondsmith’s comments do not necessarily suggest the Cyberpunk sequel will feature a future Chicago, rather a city that has the <em>feel</em> of a dystopian version of the city. It may well be a take on future Chicago, but that isn’t confirmed based on these comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is also already some debate about whether Cyberpunk 2 will expand upon the Night City that’s in Cyberpunk 2077 or feature a new version, and the extent to which it is playable. There are a lot of unknowns, but it looks like there may be two fleshed out playable cities in this sequel at the very least.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a hugely busy time for CD Projekt, of course. There’s a new Cyberpunk animation project on Netflix following the well-received Cyberpunk: Edgerunners in the works. In the shorter term, Cyberpunk 2077 is set to launch on Nintendo Switch 2 next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
