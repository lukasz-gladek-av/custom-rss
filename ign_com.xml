In total, the Switch 2 sold 1.6 million units in the U.S. during its launch month, beating the PlayStation 4's previous sales record of 1.1 million units in November of 2013. Unshockingly, it was the best-selling console of the month both in terms of units and dollar sales.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Across both Nintendo Switch platforms, Switch 2-exclusive Mario Kart World was the best-selling game of the month, followed by Cyberpunk 2077 and Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, both of which launched alongside the new console. In fourth and fifth place respectively were Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild, followed by Street Fighter 6, Mario Kart 8, Hogwarts Legacy, Bravely Default's remaster, and Minecraft. Because Nintendo doesn't share digital sales numbers with Circana, this chart may be missing some big sellers. For instance, we learned today that <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/deltarune-topped-switch-2-digital-charts-in-june-while-mario-kart-world-dominated-in-active-players/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deltarune topped Switch 2 charts in digital sales in June</a>, but with no physical edition and the game only costing $25, it's missing from the dollar sales ranking entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So does all this Nintendo Switch 2 success mean it's on track to outsell the Nintendo Switch 1? I asked Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, and this is what he told me:</p><blockquote>What the launch sales of Switch 2 primarily tell us is that they made a lot of Switch 2 to sell at launch. Lifetime sales and launch sales of a console often do not correlate, meaning that some consoles with small launches ended up doing incredibly well lifetime (PS2 only sold 400k in its launch month) while others with big launches ended up not doing as well lifetime. Since launch month demand is rarely satiated by available supply (and it is certainly not a great sign when it is, historically) all we can really get a read on at launch is the confidence of the manufacturer to make so many units available, and the ability of the supply chain to get those units into the market.</blockquote><blockquote>But having the biggest launch month sales for any new video game hardware platform is a helluva good start.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Across all platforms, Elden Ring: Nightreign was the best-selling game of the month for the second month in a row, followed by debut titles Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Mario Kart World. Those numbers don't include Nintendo digital sales of Mario Kart World, and they also don't include physical hardware bundles, meaning Mario Kart World will likely have performed significantly better than is indicated here. Per analysis by Circana's Mat Piscatella, 82% of Nintendo Switch 2 buyers in June purchased Mario Kart World either via a standalone sale, or as part of a bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma debuted at No.10. Stellar Blade ranked No.5 on the overall charts and was the second best-selling game on PlayStation thanks to its debut on the platform last month. And while Final Fantasy XVI didn't crack the overall top 20, it was the fourth best-selling game on Xbox, also thanks to its release on the platform in June. Overall, content spending in June was up 6% year-over-year, largely driven by Switch 2 game sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Accessories spending also set a new June record of $293 million, in no small part due to sales of the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. It was the best-selling accessory of the month and has a 32% attach rate with Nintendo Switch 2 hardware.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">June 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Elden Ring: Nightreign</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach (NEW)</li><li>Mario Kart World (NEW)*</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Stellar Blade</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>MLB: The Show 25*</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Grant Theft Auto V</li><li>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</li><li>Split Fiction</li><li>EA Sports FC 25</li><li>Elden Ring</li><li>NBA 2K25</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered</li><li>Star Wars: Battlefront II (2017)</li><li>Cyberpunk 2077*</li><li>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</li><li>WWE 2K25</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.
