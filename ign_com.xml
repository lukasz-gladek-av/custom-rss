            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Bloodborne was just one of a number of projects Bluepoint had rejected before it was shuttered earlier this month.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bluepoint, the studio behind the successful Shadow of the Colossus and Demon's Souls remakes, reportedly pitched a Bloodborne remake last year that was rejected not by Sony, as many have thought, but by FromSoftware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Bloomberg report</a> discussing the reasons Bluepoint was shut down by Sony earlier this month. As Bloomberg shares, Bluepoint was working on a live-service God of War game following its acquisition by Sony and support work on God of War Ragnarok. The God of War game would have involved Atreus falling into Hades, and different "versions" of him battling through it with some kind of cooperative element.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea didn't really coalesce and Bluepoint, famous for more traditional action games, was a poor fit for the project, so it was canceled in January of 2025. The studio was encouraged to pitch other ideas, and the one that made the most sense was a remake of 2015's amazing, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review">IGN 9.1/10</a>, Bloodborne.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/another-bloodborne-state-of-play-no-show-leaves-fans-questioning-if-ps5-port-will-ever-happen">Fans have begged for a Bloodborne remake or sequel for years</a>, with all sorts of rumors cropping up that one might be in the works at any given time. Popular belief has been that Sony, as the IP owner, is what stands in the way of FromSoftware actually making one. But according to Bloomberg, that may not be the case. According to those working at the studio, they were told that while Sony was interested in a Bloodborne remake, FromSoftware was not, and the idea was scrapped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodborne's status has long been in limbo with various individuals with ties to the project sharing conflicting thoughts on what can be made of it. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5">Back in 2024</a>, FromSoftware director Hidetaka Miyazaki said it was "not in my place" to talk about a Bloodborne remake because FromSoftware does not own the IP. He also told Eurogamer at the time that the game would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">benefit from a release on modern hardware</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, the following year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hasnt-sony-done-anything-more-with-bloodborne-playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-personal-theory">PlayStation's Shuhei Yoshida offered a theory on KindaFunny</a> as to what was going on with Bloodborne that may match up with what happened to Bluepoint's pitch:</p><blockquote>Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing. And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.</blockquote><blockquote>I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The question of why no one seems to want to hit such an obvious home run, or let someone like Bluepoint hit it for them, remains. FromSoftware is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-is-making-a-new-vampire-game-for-nintendo-switch-2-but-its-not-bloodborne-2">currently hard at work on The Duskbloods</a>, a similarly vampire-themed game exclusive to Nintendo Switch 2. As for Bluepoint, it reportedly went on to pitch other ideas, such as an updated Shadow of the Colossus and a spinoff of Ghost of Tsushima, before it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-demons-souls-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-games">tragically shut down by Sony</a>, with leaders believing the studio was not equipped to make its own game and was unable to find a sensible partnership. Per Bloomberg, some companies are currently in talks to see if they can save the studio and take it off Sony's hands, but no word yet as to how successful that might be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">You may have clicked into this review thinking, “A review of Under Night In-Birth 2 Sys:Celes? In the year of our Lord 2026?!” And you know what, that’s fair. This fighting game came out at the beginning of 2024, and it’s one that builds off a foundation laid by the 2012 original, which we also never reviewed<em>.</em> Well, I’ve decided better late than never, because Under Night In-Birth 2 is quite simply one of the best 2D fighters on the market right now – especially for fighting game fans that pine for the days of fast-paced anime fighters but with all the modern conveniences we’ve come to expect. It’s full of gorgeous pixel art and completely outlandish character designs alongside things like exceptional netcode and the ability to take control of a character during a replay, making its satisfyingly steep learning curve a joy to try and overcome, and its online play a staple of my fighting game rotation well past its initial launch.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mitchell's Favorite Fighting Games</h3></p><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/Mitchell-IGN/lists/mitchells-favorite-fighting-games" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">For those completely unfamiliar, Under Night In-Birth (or just UNI for short) is the first wholly original series from Japanese developer French Bread, which was previously known mostly for Melty Blood, a 2D fighter based on the world and characters of the visual novel Tsukihime. The UNI games are four-button fighters with light, medium, and heavy attack buttons, as well as the Exs Action button, which has a number of uses ranging from short hops, to defensive shields, to meter management, etc. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s really cool about this fighting system at a basic level is that while most fighting games have a linear sort of logic to their combo system, allowing you to chain lights into mediums into heavies, UNI kind of just says “screw it, do what you want, it’ll work.” You can chain heavies into lights and lights into heavies, or convert big combos off of little pokes. Anytime you land any sort of touch in UNI, you can get big damage off of it, which is a very liberating feeling.</p><p>You can get big damage off any touch, which is a very liberating feeling.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also makes jumping into the shallow end of a new character very intuitive, even though they’re all <em>so </em>different from each other. I wouldn’t dare take a brand new character into online play and try to get by  using simple combos alone, but if all you’re going to do is play through Arcade mode or mash some buttons against a similarly skilled friend, UNI’s flexible fighting system makes it very easy to do so on a casual level without relying solely on auto-combos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t let any of that fool you into thinking UNI is easy, though. The game speed is lightning fast, its zoning can feel utterly oppressive if you don't know how to deal with it, and the mixups certain characters can do will make you feel like you just got utterly blended. You really need to make use of its many different mechanics to be able to fight on an even playing field, and learning those is going to take some time – and for the more casual fighting game fan, it may even feel a bit like homework.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the heart of UNI is the GRD system, and there’s really nothing else quite like it in the expansive world of 2D fighters. Basically, imagine it as a tug-of-war-style minigame that runs parallel to the actual fighting, with the winner being granted a pretty massive advantage for a limited amount of time. At the bottom of the screen, you’ll see a meter comprised of six diamonds on either side. You fill your side of the meter by moving forward, landing attacks, blocking, using the riskier (but more rewarding) shield block, and by holding down the Exs Action button to sit still and charge it up like you’re a Dragon Ball Z character raising your power level. You can also lose meter by moving backwards, getting hit, or having your own attacks blocked by the opponent’s shield block. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this push and pull is happening, a timer will continue to circle around the middle of the meter, and once it’s up, the person with more of that meter filled wins the minigame and will enter the Vorpal State. While in the Vorpal State, you deal 10% more damage and gain the ability to use a technique called Chain Shift, which allows you to cancel the recovery of any move – much like a Roman Cancel in the Guilty Gear series – and also convert some of your diamonds from the GRD meter into your EXS meter, which governs your ability to use super moves and EX special moves. </p><p>GRD is unusual, it's complicated, but it's also kind of brilliant. <span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unusual, it’s complicated, but it’s also kind of brilliant. It encourages aggressive play while equally rewarding skillful defense; it’s largely negligible at lower levels of play, so newcomers don’t even have to worry about it, while more skilled fighters must split their focus between attacking the opponent in front of them and consider how their actions affect the GRD meter. It also further encourages careful meter and resource management, which is something every great modern fighting game benefits from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I love the way fighting games look these days; Arc System Works, in particular, does an incredible job of blending 3D characters in 2D environments and reaping the benefits of both dimensions. But  I’m also just a huge sucker for incredible 2D sprite art, and UNI’s characters rank up there among the best. Whether it’s the wild flowing hair and flailing limbs of Minerva, the lightning-fast speed and rapid slashes of Seth, or the hilariously gargantuan arms of Waldstein, the 24 characters (plus three more as paid DLC) of UNI2 absolutely brim with personality and flair. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/2026-02-27-10-00-44-3-1772215670346.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m a big fan of rushdown characters, so Linne was the first one I gravitated towards, and I was initially taken aback by just how “rushdown” she actually was. Her run speed is incredibly fast, allowing her to close the distance from full screen in basically the blink of an eye. Even without learning her big damage combos, it’s a ton of fun to look for that slight opening to get in and then utterly blitzing my opponent with a fairly basic strike/throw gameplan. I’m at the point now where I definitely need to dig a little deeper into her moveset and find better ways to open people up, and fortunately, the teaching tools that UNI2 provides are stellar as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a mission mode that gives you a basic overview of how to play each character, along with a wide variety of combos that cover just about every situation you could imagine sorted by difficulty. You’ve got quick, low-hitting combos you can use from point-blank range, overhead combos, combos that come out of your farthest reaching poke, anti-air combos, corner combos, and better versions of previous combos that build upon what you’ve already learned to squeeze out just a bit more damage. Once you get all the way down to the bottom, that’s where you’ll learn the big damage combos that incorporate Chain Shifts, super moves, and other high level techniques. It’s pretty much everything you need to build a full game plan with a character, all packed within the actual game itself, which should be the standard for any modern fighting game. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The unfortunate thing for anyone looking to learn about these characters by playing through their story mode, however, is that you’re going to feel buried under a mountain of jargon and names that won’t mean anything to you if you didn’t play the previous games in the series. The world and lore of Under Night is extensive, and there’s no effort made in this version to catch new players up on what “The Hollow Night” is, what the heck “EXS” is, or even what an “In-Birth” means. You are getting dropped into the supposed final chapter of a story, after all. Still, some sort of index or compendium would have gone a long way toward making these otherwise fairly dry arcade mode stories a bit easier to follow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In general, UNI2 is lacking in content outside of its central modes. If you’re not a serious fighting game player who wants to grind online play and make use of its fantastic teaching tools to get better, there’s not going to be a ton here to hold your interest. Fortunately, if you <em>are </em>one of those people, UNI2 does have a feature that many AAA fighting games still don’t: Replay Takeover. While watching a replay, you’re able to take control of one of the characters at any point. This allows you to repeat something that gave you trouble in a match and try to find a way to learn from it. Like, for example, an offensive sequence that you got hit with that seemed air tight when you were in the moment – when you run it back, you might be able to find a spot where you could use an invincible reversal attack, or maybe your shield to push the opponent back far enough that their next attack wouldn’t have landed. Just like in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-review">Street Fighter 6</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>, and the scant few other fighting games that have this feature, it’s an absolute godsend when it comes to improving your matchup knowledge. </p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Under Night In-Birth 2 Sys:Celes is a 2D fighter for people who love 2D Fighters, myself included. It’s incredibly deep, has a rich and well-rounded roster with some of the coolest looking characters around, features excellent teaching tools to give you everything you need to improve, and even comes with replay takeover for the truly hardcore that intend to watch their matches back and learn from their mistakes. A lot of those excellent features (as well as its great rollback netcode) may go completely unnoticed for the more casual audience, and the lack of context in story mode will no doubt make newcomers feel lost without a flashlight when it comes to navigating it’s dense lore. But as far as the most important aspects of a 2D fighter go, Under Night In-Birth 2 ranks up there with the best of them.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/under-night-in-birth-2-sysceles-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Darkness falls.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">At the very outset of World of Warcraft’s Midnight expansion, we are summoned by an actual prayer to aid in repelling recurring big bad Xal'atath's invasion of the elven kingdom of Quel'Thalas. And while I'm all for starting out in medias res, this feels like a particularly hamfisted and contextless way to begin a story. It's almost disorienting at first, and I imagine even more so if you haven't watched the five or six pre-expansion cinematics Blizzard has released at this point. Thankfully, from that point onward, the 10 hours or so I've spent with Midnight so far have otherwise been delightful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Riding into the reimagined elven capital of Silvermoon is one of those WoW moments I'm not going to forget for a long time. Its gleaming ivory spires towered above me as an excellent new musical theme that references multiple previous ones filled me with awe. The layout does feel a bit alienating sometimes while on the ground since it's clearly built for flying mounts, and I think there's a bit too much open space. But the level of detail is maybe the highest we've ever seen for an in-game city in WoW ever, with evocative interiors that interconnect in unexpected ways and invite exploration. My framerate has been less than stellar, though.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Expanding legacy areas like Murder Row into extensive subzones with a lot going on helps the city come alive. And I spent more than half my playtime so far without ever venturing outside the walls, excitedly completing every side quest. It's no secret that I'm a big "Thalassaboo," having been a fan of the elves of Quel'Thalas since Warcraft 2. And even the smaller, optional adventures in Silvermoon excellently immerse you in the decadence, pridefulness, and political maneuvering that characterize the city. As an Alliance player, I was also impressed with how much of it we get to explore – only about a quarter of it is off-limits to us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the shining capital, Eversong Woods has also been reimagined gorgeously. It was already one of my favorite zones in the entire history of WoW, and to see it get such a glow-up, finally healed from the scars of Arthas' invasion all those years ago, is fantastic. The brewing story about the dangers of fanaticism hasn't completely gripped me yet. But Xal'atath's Voidstorm being held back by essentially a giant drain plug that won't last forever adds an ominous urgency to all of it. And I feel like I have a little bit more context now for who Xal is as a villain, thematically, though most of that comes from those out-of-game cutscenes I mentioned.</p><p>Eversong Woods has also been reimagined gorgeously.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I played several different classes to level 80 in the pre-patch event, which included most of the class changes for Midnight, focusing on my trusty Marksmanship Hunter main and the new Devourer Demon Hunter that unlocks with the expansion. I'm not ready to pass judgement on any spec until I see how they play at max level in difficult content. But as far as Marksmanship goes, I mostly agree with the changes so far thematically. Aimed Shot should be a big nuke that takes a long time to cast. But with the removal of talents like Streamline, the damage needs to feel a lot chunkier than it currently does to earn that fantasy. Our final apex talent, which will give it a 100% critical chance at level 90, could be the answer. We'll see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as Devourer, I'm not sold on it quite yet. I like the other Demon Hunter specs quite a bit, but the flavor of Devourer is a bit more caster-coded than the melee monsters Demon Hunters have always been in the lore. Baseline abilities like Consume don't feel kinetic enough to me. They don't feel… Demon Hunter-y, if that makes sense. And it could just be an animation thing. I kind of wish Reap was our main button instead. But the mobility is there, and the mid-range DPS playstyle is interesting. Again, I'll report back on how it feels at max level.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">World of Warcraft Early Access Housing Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since player housing, probably the biggest new feature of Midnight, launched way back in December, I've put well over 100 hours into it already. And while the decor I've seen after 10 hours with the expansion proper makes me think Blizzard was <em>really</em> holding out on us with the initial offerings, it's already become one of my main motivations to log in. The tools are very powerful when you learn how to use them, and I'm astounded and inspired to see what some people have done with them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, housing definitely shows that it's a first try in some places. The hotkeys to switch between editing your house and normal gameplay are kind of clunky and add too many steps to certain tasks. There are some common sense features missing, like being able to copy and paste a decoration or furniture item if I have another one in my storage. And it's neat that dyes can be made by other players, but currently I get frustrated previewing different colors on a piece, then having to make a shopping list and go all the way back to town to visit the auction house and buy the paints I want. I'd like for that process to be faster and have fewer steps.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Len Ranks All the WoW Expansions</h3><p>Every WoW expansion ranked best to worst.

It gives us plenty of space to level and see the pre-raid 12.0 story at our own pace, but if gear progression is your main thing and you're not currently subscribed, you could definitely hold off a couple more weeks because you're not going to have much to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'll be updating this review as I make my way through the story and try out a few different specs at max level, with a final score to come some time after Season 1 launches so I can get an idea for how the endgame feels this time around.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="title3"><svg data-cy="icon-logo" viewBox="0 0 76 24" title="IGN"><title>IGN Logo</title><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M5.38 7.65a7.85 7.85 0 0 1 2.26-2.26c.13-1.18.31-2.26.52-3.21a10.605 10.605 0 0 0-6 6c.95-.22 2.03-.39 3.21-.52M16.34 5.36v.02c.9.59 1.67 1.37 2.27 2.27 1.18.13 2.26.31 3.21.52a10.627 10.627 0 0 0-6.02-6.01c.22.95.4 2.02.54 3.2M7.64 18.62c-.9-.59-1.67-1.37-2.27-2.27h-.03c-1.19-.14-2.26-.32-3.19-.54 1.07 2.75 3.26 4.95 6.01 6.02-.22-.95-.39-2.03-.52-3.21M18.64 16.35h-.03c-.59.9-1.37 1.67-2.27 2.27v.03c-.14 1.17-.32 2.25-.54 3.19a10.59 10.59 0 0 0 6.03-6.03c-.94.22-2 .4-3.19.54M10.04 0h3.9c.85 1.85 1.2 4.59 1.3 5.52.04.22.06.43.06.63L12 9.11 8.7 6.15c0-.17.02-.35.05-.55.1-.95.43-3.75 1.29-5.61M8.7 17.83c0 .17.02.35.05.55.1.95.43 3.75 1.29 5.61h3.9c.85-1.84 1.2-4.59 1.3-5.52.04-.22.06-.43.06-.64L12 14.87l-3.3 2.96ZM6.16 8.68c-.17 0-.35.02-.55.05-.95.12-3.75.45-5.61 1.31v3.9c1.84.85 4.59 1.19 5.52 1.3.22.04.43.06.64.06L9.11 12 6.16 8.7ZM24 10.02c-1.86-.86-4.66-1.19-5.61-1.29-.2-.03-.38-.05-.55-.05l-2.96 3.3 2.96 3.3c.2 0 .41-.02.64-.06.93-.11 3.68-.45 5.52-1.3v-3.9Z"></path><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M42.83 13.9V10h10.45c1.06 0 1.93.86 1.93 1.92v4.63c0 2.38-1.91 4.36-4.33 4.36h-6.69c-4.96 0-8.97-4-8.97-8.94s4.04-8.95 8.98-8.95h10.36v4.11H44.2c-2.67 0-4.86 2.17-4.86 4.84s2.16 4.83 4.86 4.83h6.91v-2.91h-8.27ZM33.86 3h-4.07v16.02c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.15V3M74.37 3.01h-2.18v13.81s0 .08-.03.11a.29.29 0 0 1-.24.14c-.09 0-.16-.04-.25-.15L64.83 4.93a4.347 4.347 0 0 0-3.72-2.11h-.07c-2.39 0-4.32 1.93-4.32 4.32v11.88c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.17V7.14s.02-.09.04-.13a.29.29 0 0 1 .24-.14c.09 0 .18.03.24.14l6.88 12.07c.76 1.27 2.12 2.05 3.69 2.05h.07c2.39 0 4.32-1.93 4.32-4.32V4.92c0-1.05-.85-1.91-1.91-1.91"></path></svg>Recommends</h3></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-review]]></content:encoded>
