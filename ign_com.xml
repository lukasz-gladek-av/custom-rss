It’s a message that thanks fans for trying out Pokémon TCG Pocket since its launch a few weeks ago, and more importantly, it tells players what they can expect if they stick around. Update plans not only include new cards but even new, mysterious features that have yet to be announced.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone! Today, I'd like to share a brief statement by the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonTCGPocket?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#PokemonTCGPocket</a> Team about more immediate updates coming to the game in the next few months.</p><p>I look forward to sharing more details with everyone as they become available! <a href="https://t.co/eaN35vRpSw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/eaN35vRpSw</a></p></div>— Pokémon TCG Pocket (@PokemonTCGP) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1856819952713453683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket will receive at least one “major update” in the near future, with the team saying that the plans is to release new booster packs before the end of the year. Those who have picked up the Pokémon mobile game so far have been treated to three packs – Genetic Apex Mewtwo, Charizard, and Pikachu – with three pools of cards to choose from. It’s unclear exactly how many more packs will release in the next few months or which creatures they will feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How and when the card roster will grow remains a mystery, but one feature that has been on everyone’s minds is currently slated to arrive early next year: trading. The ability to trade cards with other players is a Social Hub menu option that’s been grayed out since launch, and in January, Pokémon TCG Pocket will finally make it available to use. It’s worth noting that today’s message clarifies that only “certain cards” will be available to trade at release, with the team promising to “expand the selection of cards that are able to be traded” over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the message keeps more than a few details hidden, rest assured that more features will come to Pokémon TCG Pocket down the line. “Also, we have other new features in development outside of the trade feature introduced here,” the message says. “We plan to announce more details about the update as the dates for the addition of these features are finalized, so please look forward to it.”</p><div id="best-pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Pokemon TCG Pocket Cards Tier List</h3><h3>Best Pokemon TCG Pocket Cards Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This mobile version of everyone’s favorite pocket monster trading card game has taken the world by storm since it launched late last month.
