"You might run a corporation, but I run the streets," he wrote on social media at the time. He has now been ordered to pay $17,500 in damages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last November, we learned <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamer-sent-nintendo-a-letter-boasting-he-had-a-thousand-burner-channels-to-stream-pirated-nintendo-games-from-and-could-do-this-all-day-now-nintendo-has-sued-him-for-millions-of-dollars"><u>Nintendo had sued a gamer for streaming pirated Nintendo games</u></a> such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom"><u>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</u></a> before their official release date. Nintendo filed a lawsuit in a Colorado court against Keighin accusing him of not only streaming 10 Nintendo games before they came out, but telling his viewers how to obtain them. The list includes The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the lawsuit, Keighin obtained and streamed leaked Nintendo games at least 50 times since 2022, and provided links to the Yuzu and Ryujinx emulators for viewers. Nintendo alleged these actions amounted to “trafficking” in illegal “circumvention devices,” and insisted they caused “millions of dollars” worth of damage through “lost video game sales.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-wins-lawsuit-against-defiant-pirate-streamer-everygameguru/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TorrentFreak</u></a>, however, the court did not agree to issue an injunction against anonymous "third parties" or order the "destruction" of the devices Keighin uses to circumvent Nintendo's piracy systems, saying the demand was "unclear" and "unreasonable" without knowing who those third parties were or what the circumvention devices specifically are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An injunction against Keighin was granted, though, preventing him from "infringing Nintendo's copyrighted works, including by streaming, and from trafficking in Switch emulators, Nintendo's proprietary cryptographic keys, or other software or technologies that circumvent Nintendo's technological protective measures."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keighin reportedly did not prepare a defense nor any objections, and the judgment is now final.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">20 Overlooked Nintendo Switch Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month IGN reported <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-lawsuit-demands-45-million-settlement-from-reddit-mod-who-sold-switch-roms-insists-figure-is-nowhere-near-an-amount-that-would-compensate-for-the-seriousness-of-the-defendants-conduct"><u>Nintendo was suing a Reddit moderator and alleged Switch pirate for $4.5 million</u></a>, claiming the figure is "nowhere near an amount that would compensate Nintendo of America for the seriousness of the Defendant's conduct." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The conduct Nintendo references is the alleged "DMCA anti-trafficking violations" of James "Archbox" Williams, a moderator on the Switch Pirates subreddit who is accused of copying and distributing pirated Nintendo Switch games. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/surprise-nintendo-tracked-down-alleged-switch-pirate-in-arizona-via-reddit-posts-and-repair-orders"><u>Nintendo tracked down the alleged Switch pirate last year using a combination of Reddit posts and repair orders</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s Sidekicks, the adorable little pets that accompany you on your Fortnite adventures, have caused quite a stir with Fortnite fans — and not necessarily for all the right reasons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As described by Epic Games, Sidekicks are new pals in Fortnite that join your adventures in Battle Royale, Fortnite Save the World, Fortnite Festival (your Sidekick will stay backstage), LEGO Fortnite, and developer-made experiences (Sidekicks can only tag along with you if the Island Developer has enabled Sidekicks in their island). They let you "enjoy their company as they react to the world around you." You can design them yourself, including their personality and physical traits, all of which will be locked in as "permanent" details, but you'll be able to change their name and accessories — think hats, hoodies, that kind of thing — at any time. And no, they do not offer a gameplay advantage of any kind, nor can be hurt or killed in combat. (Phew!)</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/31/fortnite-sidekicks-1761909420805.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite Sidekicks are here. Image credit: Epic Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first is Peels, the super sweet pup made of bananas, who'll unlock with tomorrow's (November 1) Battle Pass. More, including Bonesy, Spike, and Lil' Raptor, are set to drop on November 7, with something for cat lovers coming "not long after." Bonesy will be granted to players who own the Bonesy Back Bling on the same date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, so cute, right? The bit that's really raising eyebrows, however, is the cost. As shared on the Fortnite <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1okk24y/sidekick_prices_have_been_revealed_and/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>subreddit</u></a>, prices will differ, with Lil' Raptor and Spike costing 1,200 V-Bucks, and Flopsticks and Cuddle Team Jr. a little more expensive at 1,500. As some are <a href="https://x.com/FortnitePV2/status/1984116283064119765" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pointing out</u></a>, this is a pretty steep price for the new feature, with the Fishstick-themed Sidekick, Flopstick, costing more than the original 1,200 skin.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Bro… The Sidekick costs more than the original skin. <a href="https://t.co/HUi9oqa9N4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/HUi9oqa9N4</a></p>— Fortnite Leaks | Pluto V2 (@FortnitePV2) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortnitePV2/status/1984116283064119765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 31, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It gets even worse, though. Epic has cofirmed you can customize the appearance of your Sidekick one time and it's permanent (you can unlock clothes for them, though and can change those whenever you want). This means that if you want to change your pet's colors after making that initial, permanent one-time change, you have to buy the same pet again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You can customize the Appearance of your Sidekick <strong>one time</strong> after obtaining it," <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-battle-royale-c-202300000001636/gameplay-c-202300000001721/how-do-i-customize-the-appearance-of-my-sidekick-a202300000021343" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Epic said</a>. "You can purchase a Sidekick multiple times and give them different Appearances; however, each Sidekick customization you own in your Locker must be unique. Duplicate Appearances are not allowed." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The fact they locked customization behind needing to buy the same pet multiple times is probably the greediest thing Epig [sic] has ever done. Which honestly is a huge accomplishment for this company," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1okk24y/comment/nmbdws5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a> one unhappy player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[This is] the death of reasonable microtransactions in Fortnite," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1okk24y/comment/nmbpiqu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a> another. "Remember when they released Wraps, and unlike most games where you needed to unlock skins for each gun individually, wraps could be used on anything? Now we're getting customization locked on bought items. No reason for this, except greed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Either make them this price and have all styles selectable or lock the styles and put them at 500-600," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1okk24y/comment/nmb9vu1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>suggested</u></a> someone else.
