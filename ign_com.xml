            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fear-platinum-will-join-gog-preservation-program-by-next-month-in-honor-of-monoliths-legacy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">More Monolith 'icons' are on the way, too.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the wake of Monolith Productions' closure, CD Projekt's GOG has moved up its timeline for preserving one of Monolith's classics. <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fear_platinum" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">F.E.A.R. Platinum will join the GOG Preservation Program</a> by next month, and may also be the first of more Monolith games to hit the program.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The inflential 2005 first-person shooter is getting moved up on GOG's timeline for the Preservation Program to "properly recognize Monolith's contributions to gaming." <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Preservation Program</a> is GOG's initiative to keep classic games playable on modern systems, maintaining the titles in DRM-free form and with dedicated tech support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GOG has previously featured everything from Heroes of Might and Magic 3: Complete, to the original Resident Evil trilogy, to I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. It's an eclectic spotlight of games preserved in playable form, available on GOG's storefront, and F.E.A.R. Platinum — which includes the base F.E.A.R. and both expansions — will soon join the lineup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may not be the last Monolith game there, either. GOG said that other Monolith icons will "join eventually as well." The storefront also teased more news to come about the Preservation Program tomorrow, February 27.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The preservation effort is a nice recognition of Monolith Productions' legacy in the wake of its sudden closure. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier broke the news yesterday that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-cancels-wonder-woman-game-closes-three-studios">Warner Bros. had canceled its planned Wonder Woman game and shuttered three studios</a>: Monolith, Player First Games, and WB San Diego.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros.' games division has been in a difficult spot for some time. While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-review-harry-potter-ps5-xbox-pc">Hogwarts Legacy</a> chalked up a commercial win for the publisher, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-spurs-double-digit-drop-in-wb-gaming-revenue">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League spurred a double-digit decline in revenue</a>, and the financial failure of Smash-alike <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-to-shut-down-when-season-5-concludes-in-may">MultiVersus</a> piled on the misery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-is-leaving-the-company-a-year-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disastrous-launch">David Haddad is set to leave the company</a> after 12 years of helming Warner Bros. Games, and the <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-wb-discovery-looking-to-sell-off-games-other-divisions-to-prevent-total-breakup" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">division is rumored to be considered for-sale</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monolith had a legacy dating back decades, with games like Blood, Condemned: Criminal Origins, No One Lives Forever, and The Matrix Online on its resume. Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor became an instant hit, spurred on by its inventive "Nemesis System," which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-warner-bros-shut-down-shadow-of-mordor-developer-monolith-and-canceled-wonder-woman-fans-lament-the-wasted-potential-of-its-nemesis-system">Warner Bros. held in a vice-grip with its patent</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Monolith may be closed, it's nice to see other companies acknowledge the effect one studio has had on the medium. Hopefully we see more of Monolith's classics preserved for years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-gallery-card-seemingly-teases-hellfire-gala-theme-and-characters-for-season-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Keen-eyed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals"><u>Marvel Rivals</u></a> players have spotted an in-game reference that seems to suggest that Season 2’s theme and characters will revolve around the classic Marvel comics storyline, the Hellfire Gala.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Information on what NetEase Games could be planning for its next seasonal content drop was first spotted and shared <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1iy4eu3/season_2_is_hellfire_gala_confirmed_in_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>by Reddit user DynamiteDynamo10</u></a>. Their post includes a screenshot of the "Plans Within Plans" Gallery Card included in the in-game event page in Season 1, containing dialog and story details tied to the current season. It’s a lengthy entry in what is already a game brimming with lore, but what’s interesting is how it ends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now, if you will excuse me, Doom has a gala to attend,” the post concludes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not exactly an all-out reveal that Season 2 will follow a story set around Marvel’s well-known gala event, but it is at least a suspicious mention that you’ll need to dig to find. Meanwhile, other players are using Doctor Doom’s gala reference as fuel to the fire that are the rumors that X-Men regular Emma Frost will soon join Marvel Rivals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seemingly leaked Emma Frost voice lines were <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1893535638214922567" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>shared online by X0XLeak</u></a> this past weekend, kicking off speculation that the diamond-skinned character could be added sooner rather than later. She also happens to play a part in the original Hellfire Gala storyline along with a laundry list of other Marvel icons. Voice lines like this are suspicious on their own, so coupled with the reference to the gala, these details have some players already plotting out how Emma Frost could break apart the current Marvel Rivals meta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the development makes sense for many, others are saying the reference isn’t enough to confirm which Marvel names will join the Marvel Rivals roster in Season 2. If the next content drop, which is expected to arrive mid-April, is truly set to add content themed around the Hellfire Gala, then the Gallery Card is the first time NetEase has said anything official on the matter. So, even if we assume Season 2 centers around the Hellfire Gala, the story could include Emma Frost or go a different path completely.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, so many other players have spent the entirety of Marvel Rivals Season 1’s vampire-themed romp expecting to see Blade join as the next playable character following multiple in-game appearances. Some have suggested that this could mean we see the Daywalker join for one half of the season while Emma joins in another, while others theorize that Emma may not join until Season 3. At the least, NetEase has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-promises-a-new-hero-every-month-and-a-half">it plans to deliver at least one new character every half-season</a>, so Season 2 is sure to surprise players one way or another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these details are based purely on speculation; we won’t know what NetEase has planned for at least another few weeks. Until the team has more to share about the future of Marvel Rivals, you can check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-just-made-a-classic-moon-knight-meme-feel-a-little-more-real">how it chose to include a reference to an infamous Moon Knight meme</a> as part of its mid-season update. You can also read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-fear-netease-is-planting-fake-hero-leaks-to-throw-off-dataminers-but-whats-really-going-on"><u>some of the other rumored heroes</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-says-theyre-not-trolling-dataminers-wed-rather-spend-our-time-developing-the-game"><u>why NetEase had to tell fans that it isn’t actually planting leaks</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
