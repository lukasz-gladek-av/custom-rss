            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since their announcement, Switch 2 Game-Key Cards have kindled much discussion and provoked strong opinions from gamers and developers alike. Latest to weigh in on Nintendo’s controversial format is Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi. He implied that developers are choosing Game-Key Cards not necessarily from a cost perspective, but a performance one, as the format enables them to bring smoother-running games to the Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Switch 2 Game-key cards are physical, they only contain a key, which requires the user to download the actual game from Nintendo’s online store. As Morningstar analyst Kazunori Ito recently summed up to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-23/nintendo-s-switch-2-sales-boom-fails-to-ease-game-developers-gloom?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1ODYyOTA2MiwiZXhwIjoxNzU5MjMzODYyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMzFHMDJHUFdDVFowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.ZGnG8_5dKGMsGf2fJii9xwn7A_1_oZatFwdPzCAXhjs&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg</u></a>: “The key card feels rather half-baked as it combines the drawbacks of both the physical and digital versions.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite also attracting criticism from a game preservation standpoint (see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-a-little-disheartening-the-thing-remastered-dev-says"><u>Nightdive CEO Stephen Kick</u></a>’s comments, for example), some developers have recently spoken out in favor of the Game-Key Card format, the latest being Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking through an interpreter during a recent interview with German news site <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/final-fantasy-director-hofft-dass-ihr-game-key-cards-eines-tages-moegen-koennt/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>JP Games</u></a>, Hamaguchi said that he understood why the Switch 2 Game-Key Card format is disliked. “I really get where people are coming from in terms of their negativity towards it, and there are good reasons,” he said. However, discussion between developers on the topic is “perhaps a bit different to what the fans maybe expect.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will make its Switch 2 debut on January 22, 2026. However, the game will only be released on a Game-key card, and there are reasons for this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hamaguchi explained that the major issues for those who want to release high-end, demanding games like Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on the Switch 2 is the limited memory of the cards and their slower loading speed (in comparison to consoles with disc-based games, like PS5 and Xbox Series X and S). The smaller memory size of the cards is something that “developers can’t ignore (...) we have to work around that.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 Game-Key Card, however, helps developers to circumnavigate around these restrictions. Hamaguchi added that Game-Key Cards can make it possible for developers to do “a semi-download version of the game,” utilizing the Switch 2’s internal storage, which can load games faster than if they were being loaded completely from the card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over at Ubisoft, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-developer-defends-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-says-cartridges-that-force-you-to-download-the-game-are-better-for-loading"><u>Star Wars Outlaws’ developer Rob Bantin also recently defended Game-Key Cards</u></a> from a similar standpoint, citing performance as a major reason for going down this route: “(regular) Switch 2 cards simply didn't give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In defense of the format, Hamaguchi said that he’d like for “Nintendo fans to understand the Game-Key cards and maybe come to accept them as part of the culture of gaming on Switch. (...) From a developer’s perspective, it allows us to bring more high-end experiences to Switch players, and I think that’s a good thing (...) (it lets) us do things that maybe we wouldn’t otherwise.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This echoes previous <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-switch-2-game-key-cards-help-third-party-publishers-bring-deeper-larger-and-more-immersive-content-on-the-platform"><u>remarks from Nintendo of America CEO Doug Bowser</u></a>, who suggested that Game-Key cards help third party publishers to release bigger and more ambitious games on the Switch 2: “Game-Key Cards are a way that our publishing partners are able to bring more content onto the platform- deeper and larger, more immersive content.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox's Tokyo Game Show 2025 broadcast was filled with exciting reveals and moments, including the long-awaited reveal of Forza Horizon 6, which is actually set in Japan! We also got a look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's Japanese maps, Gemma Chan as Dr. Selina Tan in 007: First Light, high-level gameplay from Ninja Gaiden 4, and even Bruce Lee joining Hitman: World of Assassination as 47's partner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were a ton of big announcements during the show, and you can find all of the biggest ones below in one place. After you check it out, let us know what your favorite part was and what you wish had shown up! </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Forza Horizon 6 Speeds to Japan in 2026</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox's Tokyo Game Show ended with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-set-in-japan-launches-2026">our first look at Forza Horizon 6,</a> which is actually located in Japan and will be released in 2026. While we didn't get to see actual cars in the open world, we were given a glimpse of a beautiful vista featuring Mount Fuji after a few fun nods to the series' past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For a long time, Japan has been top of Horizon fans’ wish lists, so we’re excited to finally be bringing this much-requested location to players in <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>,” explains art director Don Arceta to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>. “Japan has such a unique culture – from cars, to music, to fashion – that make it perfect for the next Horizon setting. As with any Horizon title, we want to make sure we do the country justice in terms of authentic representation and Horizon open world playability – and now is the right time to realize that fully for players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team also shared that the technical side of the equation is now in the right place to bring this vision to life, and they even gave the example of Forza Horizon 5's Hot Wheels DLC, which helped the team develop the elevated roads of Tokyo City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for where else Forza Horizon 6 will take us, the team isn't quite ready to share any more locations. However, they did give us a small tease.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While we’re not announcing too much in terms of detail right now, we’re excited to show fans the true breadth of beauty – both natural and urban environments – that Japan has to offer,” explains Arceta. “From the neon lights and towering buildings of Tokyo City – one of our most detailed and layered environments to date – to the serenity and natural beauty of Japan’s rural and mountain areas, we think players will be blown away by the open world of Japan that we have built."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Japan also has a long and storied history with cars, and Playground Games is doing all it can to honor that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In Japanese car culture, the depth and diversity is astonishing,” Cultural consultant Kyoko Yamashita said. “Kei cars and vans with cult followings, precision motorsport, drifting’s roots, and their passion for customization really stands out. It’s welcoming to different levels of enthusiasm and knowledge, which is exactly the kind of layered world I want players to feel.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And of course Forza Horizon 6 will have changing seasons, which will all pay homage to Japan's "sweltering summers, snowy winters and, of course, the iconic Sakura season, those precious weeks where cherry blossoms bloom across the country."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The team has also been able to build a system where seasonal changes truly inform the world – how spring, summer, autumn, and winter subtly shift tone, activity, and sound,” explains Yamashita. “The team is also really proud of the attention to everyday details: ambient audio like station chimes or summer wind bells that instantly place you without a caption. Those are quiet choices, but they carry a lot of truth.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Showcases Multiplayer Maps Set in Japan</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will feature two maps set in Japan and they were both showcased during Xbox's TGS stream. Toshin was first up and it looks to be set in 2035 Tokyo. Furthermore, it will combine "well-defined lanes and some really fun set pieces - including a cat cafe, a karaoke bar, and a crashed train."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Den is the second one and will offer a "different vibe." This map is set in the countryside outside Tokyo and "centers around a Japanese castle that's been repurposed as a Guild base."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will be released on November 14, and the Early Access Beta will start on October 2 before the Open Beta kicks off on October 5.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">007: First Light Casts Eternals' Gemma Chan as Dr. Selina Tan</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">007: First Light not only was featured during the stream with quick looks at gameplay, but we were also introduced to MI6's Head of Tactical Simulation, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-adds-marvel-star-gemma-chan-to-james-bond-game-cast">Gemma Chan's Dr. Selina Tan.</a> For those unfamiliar, Chan has previously been seen in Eternals, Raya and the Last Dragon, and Crazy Rich Asians.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Selina oversees a cutting-edge program designed to test and refine the skills of MI6’s most promising recruits," the official description reads of the brand-new character. "With her background in psychology, strategy, and immersive technologies, she is as formidable as she is innovative."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ninja Gaiden 4 Gameplay Overview Features Master Ninja Difficulty Action and Training Mode</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of its release on October 21, Ninja Gaiden took center stage at Xbox's TGS stream to showcase not only its training mode that will let you practice combos and weapons in a safe place, but also its Master Ninja mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlocked after beating Story Mode, Master Ninja will challenge players with feature late-game enemies in earlier chapters, enhanced AI, a greater number of enemies at once, and much more. For those looking for an even greater challenge, there is a setting called Death Wish mode where "growth elements are reset, and difficulty can be escalated towards an even harsher extreme." </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection Gets a Story Trailer, First Two Monster Hunter Stories Games Headed to Xbox in November</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A new story trailer was revealed for Monster Hunter Stories 3: Reflection, and it was also revealed that the original Monster Hunter Stories and Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin will be headed to Xbox Series X/S on November 14, 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bruce Lee Is Joining Hitman: World of Assassination as Your Partner</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-world-of-assassination-trailer-sees-agent-47-team-up-with-bruce-lee-for-new-elusive-target-mission">The legendary Bruce Lee is joining Hitman: World of Assassination as 47's partner</a> later today in a new Elusive Mission. 47 will need to identify threats and protect Bruce Lee and work together with him to bring down this threat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lee will play a character named Agent Lee, a character trying to infiltrate the Concorn Union in Hong Kong.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Microsoft has now formally announced Forza Horizon 6 during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-microsoft-tokyo-game-show-september-2025-everything-announced">today's big Xbox Tokyo Game Show broadcast</a> and revealed that it will release first for PC and Xbox console, before then arriving on PlayStation 5 "post-launch".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The teams at Playground Games and Turn 10 have poured their hearts into Forza Horizon 6, bringing Japan to life like never before," said Xbox exec Matt Booty, finally making the game's reveal official.  "This has been the most-requested location since the very first game and we can't wait to share more next year."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s Japan. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ForzaHorizon6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ForzaHorizon6</a> <a href="https://t.co/D6HngHj43g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/D6HngHj43g</a></p>— Forza Horizon (@ForzaHorizon) <a href="https://twitter.com/ForzaHorizon/status/1971165411119943871?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">An <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a> blog post on the game's announcement goes into more detail on why Japan has been chosen now specifically, with art director Don Arceta revealing that recent technical advances had made the game possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The beauty of Horizon games is that each one gives us learnings and ways to make the next even bigger and better," Arceta said. "As well as taking player feedback into account, we’ve also been able to lean into more practical things – for instance, the Forza Horizon 5 Hot Wheels DLC has helped us develop the elevated roads of Tokyo City in FH6.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As evidenced from today's teaser, the game will mix Tokyo's urban environment with a sample of Japan's rural areas, including Mount Fuji. The series' usual seasonal changes will also return, Arceta confirmed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ORIGINAL STORY:</strong> Forza Horizon 6, the next entry in Microsoft's racing series, will be set in Japan and launch in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft made the announcement via a post on Instagram, which has gone live several hours before today's big Xbox Tokyo Game Show broadcast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The post shows a brief teaser for Forza Horizon 6, confirming its setting and release year. "The Horizon Festival is heading to Japan," reads a caption. "Coming 2026. Wishlist now!" Logos confirm the game will be an Xbox Play Anywhere title, and unsurprisingly also launch on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While today's announcement looks to have gone live a little early, nothing from today's announcement comes as much of a surprise. Microsoft gaming chief <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-teases-return-of-halo-in-2026-and-its-reportedly-a-halo-combat-evolved-remaster">Phil Spencer previously confirmed a fresh entry in the Forza series would launch in 2026</a>, and with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-motorsport-team-is-no-more-former-developer-claims-with-remaining-turn-10-staff-left-to-support-the-horizon-side">Forza Motorsport's team reportedly gutted in the company's recent layoffs</a>, it seemed obvious this referred to a fresh Forza Horizon entry instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Forza fans have also had their eye on Japan for a while, as well — particularly after a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-location-leaked-by-car-import-company-fans-believe">teasing social media post last month from a car import company</a> connected to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
