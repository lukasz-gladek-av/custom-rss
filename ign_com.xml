Those who purchase will save a total of $155 as opposed to purchasing the console, year-long NSO subscription and video game separately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Black Friday is also a great opportunity to stock up on some new controllers in preparation for a holiday season filled with multiplayer gaming sessions. Gamers can purchase the red and blue wireless <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAVPpq?object_uuid=6dc64e3a-d0b6-4509-9179-8a2f1b248c6b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Joy-Con controllers for 25% off at Target</a> or get a hold of a <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDVqMo?object_uuid=6dc64e3a-d0b6-4509-9179-8a2f1b248c6b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pro controller for $49.99 at Best Buy</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you’re planning on taking advantage of Walmart’s $30 Tears of the Kingdom deal, you’d be remiss to disregard Amazon’s abundant deals on memory cards.

With Amazon’s nearly half off discount on the<a href="https://zdcs.link/zjGA2y?object_uuid=6dc64e3a-d0b6-4509-9179-8a2f1b248c6b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Lexar 1TB Play microSDXC memory card</a>, you can ensure you have room to download all of your favorite games without spending a small fortune.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When Is Black Friday 2024?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Black Friday actually starts on November 29</strong>, but deals have been popping up over the last few weeks. In Nintendo’s case, some games saw price cuts as early as the first of the month, but November 24 was when many of the company’s top-selling items received big discounts at retailers. If you’re looking to expand your game library, now is the time to do so, with many popular titles being sold at the lowest price of the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not a Switch gamer, there’s plenty of other video game deals to take advantage of this holiday season for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024"><u>PlayStation</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals-black-friday-2024"><u>Xbox</u></a>.

Although the event itself kicked off a few days ago, there’s never been a better time to dive in and see what turkey-themed activities there are to enjoy.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/28/blade-ball-roblox-1732789550437.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Blade Ball brings Thanksgiving Event to Roblox players for two weeks.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox Blade Ball players can access the Thanksgiving Event themselves by keeping an eye out for the turkey NPC in the lobby. Those who manage to spot a turkey in their games can be granted Turkey Coins and unlock unique rewards. It’s an event filled with distractions to keep competitors busy with additional quests, daily rewards, a shop, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">V6.4 also introduces a few other changes to keep players bouncing back. Crown Clash, for example, is a game mode that can be voted for every five rounds and sees players trying to survive while carrying a crown for as long as possible. Win Streaks are another addition that will allow users to show off their win streak with a counter above their heads. Of course, developer Wiggity also introduced a few bug fixes and balance adjustments, including nerfs for Dragon Spirit and Phantom.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Blade Ball Thanksgiving Event started on November 23 and runs for two weeks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-black-friday-deals-on-thanksgiving-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I arrived here quite by accident – one moment I was in the year 1619, the next, standing amidst a cacophony of lights, an endless sea of goods, and this strange entity called IGN dot com. At first, I feared I had been ensnared by sorcery, but now I have access to something far more wondrous: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-black-friday-2024-deals">Black Friday shopping</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What is this curious holiday where people queue in droves to trade their coin for treasures I could scarcely dream of? As I learned of these deals and contraptions, I vowed to document my findings. For if you, too, were a time traveler, these are the marvels you'd surely wish to bring home – these marvels (the best Black Friday deals to shop on Thanksgiving, by the way) would astonish any soul, no matter the century.</p><p id="gaming-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Gaming Deals">Gaming Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I would keep up the whole 17th century pilgrim theme but I'm short on time and lacking in creativity after writing about Black Friday deals for a month! Anyway, here are the absolute doorbusting deals you should come to expect from a Black Friday sale, including some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-video-games-black-friday-deals">major discounts on top games</a> like Star Wars Outlaws, Sonic X Shadow Generations, Persona 3 Reload, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not satisfied? Fine, have a look through the best console deals for Thanksgiving, as well, with discounts on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-playstation-console-deals-black-friday-2024">PS5 console bundles</a> (now down to just $375 for the digital edition), along with some of the best ever discounts we've seen for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-best-black-friday-deals-2024">Nintendo Switch</a>. These bargains won't last forever, and some are even going out of stock as I write this (blast!). </p><p id="home-and-hearth-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Home and Hearth Deals">Home and Hearth Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Have you ever considered the modern miracle that is the Air Fryer? It's a wonder of science and feels very much like magic in a small-to-medium container. It can cook sausages, chicken, falafel, and pretty much anything you can think of. Except oatmeal, don't try making oatmeal in your air fryer. </p><p id="apple-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple Deals">Apple Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever contraption you're eyeing, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-apple-deals-black-friday-2024">Black Friday Apple deals</a> are a good place to start. AirPod Pro (2nd Gen with USB-C) are <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7b3jy?object_uuid=a7ce8b62-e625-4ec6-93f1-5ef08543298b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D1XD1ZV3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on sale at Amazon</a> for $153.99 right now. I'd say it's safe to grab them if you're in the market as that's the best price we've ever seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for standard AirPods, both Amazon and Target are offering a $10 off the new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-airpods-4-with-anc-review">4th gen AirPods with active noise cancellation</a> and the model without. I personally prefer the Pro model because the silicone ear tips work well for me, but some people don't like them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has just dropped prices across the board on various <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-ipads-early-black-friday-deals-2024">Apple iPad models for Black Friday</a>, including the the <a href="https://zdcs.link/NMoYd?object_uuid=a7ce8b62-e625-4ec6-93f1-5ef08543298b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">10th gen Apple iPad</a>, which is now down to $249.99 after you clip a $29.01 off coupon on the product page. This is the best price we've seen ever since it was launched back in 2022, and I am pretty certain it won't drop again for Black Friday.</p><p id="tech-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tech Deals">Tech Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">OK, there's a few more excellent gaming deals rolled into one here, but you can't deny how excellent some of these offers are. Steam Decks are on sale along with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-meta-quest-3s-deal-2024-bonus-best-buy-target-gift-card">Meta Quest 3S with probably the best deal we've ever had on the VR headset</a>. I mean, $75 <em>free </em>Amazon credit sounds a little too good to be true, but it's not! The deal is real and well worth picking up ASAP. Still hungry? Well, go have some more turkey. I kid... or do I?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't. Check out even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-devices-echo-kindle-black-friday-2024">more great tech offers on Amazon devices</a>, perfect for improving your smart home experience in the short and long term. My favorite offer here? It's the Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $33, a new low for the streaming stick, which is also now Xbox Game Pass enabled. Get rolling as these deals really are the cream of the crop this Thanksgiving. </p><p id="streaming-black-friday-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Streaming Black Friday Deals">Streaming Black Friday Deals</h2></p><div catalogid="08f6102b-d1c3-4715-b3e4-b7fe53fe7888" id="191844"><div id="191844" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hulu (Ad Plan)</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Get 12 months at $0.99 per month, offer ends December 2.
