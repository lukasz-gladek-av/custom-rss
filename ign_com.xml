Return to Silent Hill is an adaptation created out of deep respect for a true masterpiece of a game, Konami’s iconic Silent Hill 2. I hope fans will enjoy and be fulfilled with the experience this new film has to offer."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The film's plot will feel familiar to anyone who played the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-2001"><u>Silent Hill 2</u></a> or the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake"><u>2024 Bloober remake</u></a>. It follows "James (Jeremy Irvine), a man broken after being separated from his one true love (Hannah Emily Anderson). When a mysterious letter calls him back to Silent Hill in search of her, he finds a once-recognizable town transformed by an unknown evil" and "terrifying figures both familiar and new." <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-new-movie-from-original-silent-hill-director-confirmed"><u>It was unveiled in October 2022</u></a>, but it took until May 2024 for us to get our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-movie-first-look-pyramid-head"><u>first glimpse at Return to Silent Hill's version of Red Pyramid Thing</u></a> — AKA Pyramid Head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/silent-hill"><u>Gans' first Silent Hill movie</u></a>, based loosely upon the first game, follows mother Rose as she searches for her missing daughter, Sharon, in a town where it snows during summer. Although the screenplay was written by Oscar-winning writer Roger Avary, who wrote Pulp Fiction, we thought Gans' first adaptation was a mediocre 5/10, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/04/21/silent-hill-2"><u>writing</u></a>: "So there we have it. Our worst fears realized yet again. The video game-to-film genre has endured more than a decade of mediocrity. Silent Hill is probably the smartest and best-looking video game adaptation yet, it just doesn't have much else going for it. After all, video games are about entertainment, and Silent Hill is a chore to sit through."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Silent Hill 2 (2024) Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The second movie, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/silent-hill-revelation"><u>Silent Hill: Revelation</u></a> — which was not directed by Gans but instead by Michael J. Bassett — was based loosely on sequel <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-3">Silent Hill 3</a>. That secured a less favorable 4.5 in our review: "Silent Hill Revelation 3D is an inferior sequel in every way, shape and form, a horror sequel that fails to either intrigue or scare, and one that just might have killed the franchise cold-dead."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Return to Silent Hill is slated to release sometime later this year, with Cineverse promising a "wide theatrical release in America."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

In amongst talking about Wordle and Words with Friends — it's true, Pope Leo XIV is a gamer; the brothers play the word games together every single day — the elder brother asked if his sibling had watched the movie Conclave for tips.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"He <em>had</em> just finished watching the movie Conclave," Provost revealed. "So he knew how to behave. So, it's that kind of stuff [that we talk about] — I just wanted to take his mind off of [the upcoming conclave]. Laugh about something."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From director Edward Berger, the BAFTA and Oscar-winning Conclave follows one of the world's most secretive and ancient events — selecting a new Pope. Cardinal Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes) is tasked with running this covert process after the unexpected death of the beloved Pope. Once the Catholic Church's most powerful leaders have gathered from around the world and are locked together in the Vatican halls, Lawrence finds himself at the center of a conspiracy and discovers a secret that could shake the very foundation of The Church.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.
