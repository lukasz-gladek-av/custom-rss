And with that book hitting stores in a matter of days, IGN can exclusively reveal a new preview.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out the slideshow gallery below to see several interior pages from The Art of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, showcasing some of the wealth of concept art and behind-the-scenes material in this massive hardcover:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Art of Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's Dark Horse's official description for the book:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Explore the world of BioWare's latest immersive fantasy RPG, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, with this incredible, oversized art book!

The next Mass Effect is going to have a very tough act to follow, which is not something I ever imagined I'd be saying before I got swept away on this adventure. Enjoyable action combat, a fantastic cast of allies with sweeping story arcs all their own, top-notch cinematics, and moving, nuanced character writing are the wings on which this triumphant dragon soars, pulling out all the stops in a whirlwind tour of Northern Thedas and capping it with a terrific finale that’s built on memorably tough choices and consequences. If we never get another Dragon Age, at least it got to go out on a high note."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/goddess-of-victory-nikke-is-celebrating-its-second-anniversary<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">There's a new story event and lots of free recruitment opportunities.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The free-to-play sci-fi shooter Goddess of Victory: Nikke is coming up on its second anniversary, and it’s marking the occasion by giving players lots of goodies. There are new characters, new story content, a new minigame, free recruitment opportunities, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not familiar with Goddess of Victory: Nikke, it’s a third-person idle shooter from developer Shift Up that’s available for free on iOS, Android, and PC. You lead a squad of android soldiers called Nikke, the last hope for reclaiming the overworld from a vicious race of aliens called Raptures who have forced humanity underground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game has been going strong, with more than 45 million downloads worldwide in the two years since release. To celebrate that success and give back to fans, Shift Up launched an extensive anniversary event that is ongoing now. The festivities started on October 26 with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vO9vY4nE3A" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a livestream</a> that included lots of rewards, both in game and out.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-1-1729706806095.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a new story event called Old Tales, which will let players see earlier events through the eyes of Cinderella. She previously was an enemy who players defeated during the first anniversary event Red Ash, but now you’ll get to see things from her perspective and learn more about her.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cinderella, Grave, and Rapunzel: Pure Grace will be three new characters added as part of the anniversary celebration. All three are SSR Nikke, the highest rarity of Nikke in the game. There will be lots of free recruitment opportunities that accompany them as well, making this an ideal time for newcomers to dive in.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-2-1729706806096.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you log in during the anniversary event, you can claim up to 15 Advanced Recruit Vouchers and a SSR Nikke choice box, which will let you choose between two characters to recruit for free — either Snow White: Innocent Days or the new character Rapunzel: Pure Grace. The Cinderella Pick Up Recruitment event will give you one free recruit every day until November 21, while the Grave Pick Up Recruitment event will also give you a free recruit every day from November 7 to November 28.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-3-1729706806096.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you complete the Old Tales event, you’ll get several rewards: 15 Advanced Recruit Vouchers, 15 Ordinary Recruit Vouchers, and 2 SSR Nikke choice boxes. The rewards for all of these events stack, so if you take part in all of the anniversary events on offer, you can get multiple guaranteed free characters and dozens of free recruitment opportunities. So new players can get a nice jumpstart to begin their journey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all. Since its inception, Goddess of Victory: Nikke has routinely added new minigames that spice up gameplay. It added a tower defense minigame during the 1.5 anniversary and a Dave the Diver collab minigame during this year’s summer event. That tradition continues with the second anniversary, which introduces In the Mirror, an action-platforming minigame focused on platform jumping.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-4-1729706806096.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Goddess of Victory: Nikke is also taking the celebration out into the real world. It has partnered with Bushiroad to create a Nikke trading card game that will now be published worldwide for the first time. And in the United States and Canada, it’s collaborating with milk tea brands Xing Fu Tang and The Alley to launch Nikke-branded bubble tea and hold in-store pop-up events.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-5-1729706806096.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">That will include a special drink centered on Cinderella, and select stores will have exclusive rewards and cosplayer events. In Canada, Nikke’s partnership with The Alley will run from October 28 to November 10. Their pop-up event will be in Toronto on November 9 at Scarborough Town Centre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the U.S., Nikke’s partnership with Xing Fu Tang will run from November 13 to December 15. The pop-up events will be held in New York on November 16 at Korean Town Store, in Houston on November 17 at Bellaire Blvd., and in Los Angeles on November 23 at Alhambra.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/24/bubble-tea-collab-1729792728728.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can download Goddess of Victory: Nikke for free now on , on the App Store, or Google Play.
