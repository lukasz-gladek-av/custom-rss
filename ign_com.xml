            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"They really know how to hit the right note for Japanese audiences."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Released on October 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> is quickly garnering praise from Japanese gamers who are busy exploring Sucker Punch’s depiction of 1600s Japan. Its choice of setting, picturesque scenery, and expansive map seem to be resonating with local residents, with the developers receiving plaudits for their detailed research and sense of style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sucker Punch’s standalone sequel to 2020’s award-winning Ghost of Tsushima moves the action to Ezo on Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido. You play as Atsu, a warrior on a quest to take vengeance on the six men who slaughtered her family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, Ghost of Yotei’s scenery is getting a lot of praise from Japanese speaking commenters for its beauty, especially the titular Mount Yotei. However, one <a href="https://x.com/rina_asami_w/status/1973602091873792484" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commenter</u></a>, who apparently lives in Hokkaido, shared a photo of the real Mount Yotei, saying: “You were probably thinking they exaggerated its beauty for the game, right? But Mount Yotei really is a beautiful mountain. Please come and visit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a follow-up post, they added that the developers’ decision to choose “Mount Yotei instead of (Hokkaido’s highest mountain) Daisetsuzan makes so much sense as a person born and raised in Hokkaido. Mount Yotei isn’t part of a mountain range, it stands alone, and that’s what gives it the ‘wow’ factor.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%AA%E3%83%96%E3%83%A8%E3%82%A6%E3%83%86%E3%82%A4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ゴーストオブヨウテイ</a> 、北海道で一番高い山は大雪山なんだけど、大雪山じゃなくて羊蹄山を選んだの、道産子としてめちゃくちゃよくわかる。<br>羊蹄山って山脈の中にある山じゃなくてぽつんとそびえたっていて、それが「うわあ」ってなるんだよね。 <a href="https://t.co/CRKpybvzLU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/CRKpybvzLU</a></p>— ⭕️りなんご⭕️ (@rina_asami_w) <a href="https://twitter.com/rina_asami_w/status/1973604258655469969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The view from the mountain in-game is also getting some love for being extremely beautiful, with one user <a href="https://x.com/YusukeORTtype2/status/1975100964572197129" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>sharing screenshots</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">羊蹄山からの景色バチクソ綺麗なんよなぁ<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GhostofYotei?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GhostofYotei</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%AA%E3%83%96%E3%83%A8%E3%82%A6%E3%83%86%E3%82%A4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ゴーストオブヨウテイ</a> <a href="https://t.co/KBskFi6g2w" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KBskFi6g2w</a></p>— 悠介二式/🌟 (@YusukeORTtype2) <a href="https://twitter.com/YusukeORTtype2/status/1975100964572197129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Sharing an in-game screenshot featuring Mount Yotei, another <a href="https://x.com/ngo_nyanko/status/1973441795892847049" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user</u></a> commented: “I live in Ezo but Ghost of Yotei is way more quintessentially Hokkaido than I could have imagined, lol.

Many Japanese comments point out how “cute” these animals and their movements are, such as the <a href="https://x.com/ksk0628ps/status/1973604323583205689" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>fox’s butt-wiggle reaction to your attempts to slice through bamboo</u></a>, and the appearance of the Japanese long tailed tit, with users sharing a <a href="https://x.com/popo_ta9568/status/1973711356890382555" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>screenshot</u></a> of the white bird perching on Atsu’s hand. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">シマエナガ来てくれるの！？<br>かわいい！<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GhostofYotei?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GhostofYotei</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%AA%E3%83%96%E3%83%A8%E3%82%A6%E3%83%86%E3%82%A4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ゴーストオブヨウテイ</a> <a href="https://t.co/3kjb2N2ciZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3kjb2N2ciZ</a></p>— ぽぽた (@popo_ta9568) <a href="https://twitter.com/popo_ta9568/status/1973711356890382555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">However, as cute as these animals might be, <a href="https://x.com/rerumpostalter/status/1973627963133583523" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one user</u></a> warned players that petting foxes like Atsu can do is not a good idea in real life, as although it wasn’t an issue in the 1600s, the foxes in Hokkaido nowadays carry the parasitic disease echinococcosis, which can be passed to humans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ghost of Yotei’s opening title movie, which follows Atsu riding through the landscape at speed, also gained much praise and shares, with one <a href="https://x.com/sumoguri2323/status/1973509478457958767" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Japanese language comment</u></a> going so far as to say: “As expected, this game’s opening movie has surpassed all others.” Talking about the opening, another commenter <a href="https://x.com/mushmura0704/status/1974013088384143523" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>: “You’re galloping up the hill and then boom, Mt Yotei appears at its most beautiful. I take my hat off to the staff of Sucker Punch for their good taste and successful research. They really know how to hit the right note for Japanese audiences.” Others praised translation and voice acting aspects, saying that Ghost of Yotei has a “perfect localization for Japan.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During the making of Ghost of Yotei, the developers took many research trips to Japan. Director Nate Fox <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-director-vows-to-deliver-a-respectful-representation-of-japan-on-par-with-ghost-of-tsushima"><u>previously talked about</u></a> the team’s commitment to creating a respectful representation of Japan to match Sucker Punch's previous work on Ghost of Tsushima. In fact, Fox and Jason Connel were made <a href="https://sea.ign.com/ghost-of-tsushima-ps4/169560/news/ghost-of-tsushima-lead-devs-named-ambassadors-of-actual-island" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>permanent tourism ambassadors</u></a> to the real-life Tsushima in recognition of how Ghost of Tsushima has spread awareness of the place. As more people experience Ghost of Yotei, it will be interesting to see if it gets similar recognition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

And while KurtJMac may not be the first person to have reached the outer edges of the procedurally generated world, his attempt is one of the most famous, taking almost 15 years to achieve and crossing the line on October 4. He even holds a <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/115885-longest-journey-in-minecraft" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guinness World Record</a> for the Longest Journey in Minecraft without using cheats or exploits, and has raised over half a million dollars for charity.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/06/screenshot-2025-10-06-130940-1759752590775.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">KurtJMac finally reaches the Far Lands in Minecraft.

You can see the moment KurtJMac realized he reached the Far Lands on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOS10VEgpuk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel</u></a> at 3:43:27 on the video "FLoB-a-Thon — Day 69 — THE FAR LANDS." He thought he was getting close — unless his balloons had been waiting there for over a decade! — and after acknowledging the game felt "a little bit laggy," the mythical wall came into view.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ohhhhh!" he cried when he saw it. "Who had their bets on Ocean Biome?! Good gravy!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We may not be the first people to have reached the Far Lands," KurtJMac continued, "but in my book we are absolutely the first to have brought along such an amazing community, a generous community, and I would not have changed any of it to have gotten here any sooner. And I very much appreciate all of you being here."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what happens next?

The sharp-tipped stick is the first new weapon added to Minecraft in some time, and the first new tiered item — one that is available in progressively more durable variants — added since the hoe, back in 2010.
