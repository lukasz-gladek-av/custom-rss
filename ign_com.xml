            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite is set to add pet-like cosmetic "Companions" to its battle royale, a series of fresh leaks suggest. Initial designs include a range of dogs, as well as a turtle on a skateboard. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Datamined images sourced from yesterday's new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> season update show what looks to be a golden retriever, a pair of pugs, a robot dog based on the game's iconic Cuddle Team Leader, and the aforementioned skateboard-wielding aquatic reptile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite fans have been aware of plans by developer Epic Games to release pet-like Companions for some time, based on bits of evidence dug up and posted online from past datamines. But today is our first glimpse at the Companions themselves, from what look to be user interface icons for them. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If Fortnite having pets sounds familiar, well, that's because the game <em>technically </em>has them already. During the early years of Fortnite battle royale, at least, the game offered "Pets" â€” animated animals â€” that you wore as a "backbling", or essentially like a rucksack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around a dozen or so of these Pets were released, usually within battle passes, with later designs becoming slightly more elaborate (a floating mind-controlling alien named Choppy is a personal fave, alongside a licensed Baby Yoda). But more recent years have seen Pets left by the wayside, despite fan calls for their return. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">â€” Fortnite Leaks ðŸ•œ (@FortniteFNLK) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteFNLK/status/1953578096960938007?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Epic Games is believed to be working on Companions as a far more evolved version of Pets, with the creatures able to scamper around in-game near your player character. Fans expect that these creatures will be visible to you and your squad of allies, though perhaps not to enemy players â€” so there's no blowing up of your new turtle buddy to be had.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, Epic Games is yet to acknowledge Companions as being in development, and it's still unclear if they will arrive this season. Whenever they do launch, however, Companions will be the first new cosmetic type introduced to Fortnite since November 2024, when the game introduced Kicks, better known as shoes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday's big Fortnite update saw the game launch a new alien bug-infested season for its main battle royale portion, while Fortnite OG shifted into the beloved season where Kevin the Cube first appeared. Although, as we previously reported, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/something-is-wrong-fortnite-is-doing-something-strange-but-brilliant-with-its-og-mode-which-is-now-no-longer-just-a-carbon-copy-of-the-original">strange things are going on in Fortnite OG</a> â€” where the timeline appears to be occuring slightly differently this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Working on it "all by myself."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1"><u>Metal Gear</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach"><u>Death Stranding</u></a> creator, Hideo Kojima, has confirmed he is still working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project"><u>PlayStation exclusive action espionage project</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project"><u>Physint</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though we know very little about the mysterious game, Kojima did reveal to <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-interview-1235143146/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Indiewire</u></a> that he's currently "at the conceptual stage."  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked what he was currently working on, Kojima said: "Well, Iâ€™m checking the data of the [Death Stranding 2] players all over the world â€” what kind of weapons theyâ€™re using, the routes theyâ€™re taking, all this data. And I also see these small bugs here and there, so Iâ€™m deciding where to fix and what to fix.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I also am starting to work with the team on OD because thatâ€™s a new project, and also doing Physint all by myself because thatâ€™s at the conceptual stage. So Iâ€™m doing that. And also I have all these interviews every day, and also promotional â€” photo-shootings, things like that â€” so I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™ve finished [<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach"><u>Death Stranding 2</u></a>], to be frank."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Kojima means, exactly, by "conceptual stage" remains to be seen, though it suggests that Physint is still some way away from active production. The quote also makes it sound like we'll probably see more of his Xbox project, OD, before Physint arrives. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we're on the subject of OD â€” yesterday (August 7) we reported <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kojimas-od-still-in-development-despite-xbox-game-cancellations"><u>OD is still in development</u></a>, despite Xbox's recent cancellations of a number of projects, both internal and external.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier, who claimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kojimas-od-still-in-development-despite-xbox-game-cancellations"><u>OD was 'still in development'</u></a> as confirmed to him by a Microsoft spokesperson. He shared this on the heels of reporting that Xbox was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-stops-development-on-contraband-four-years-after-initial-e3-announcement"><u>stopping development on Avalanche Studios' Contraband</u></a>, a collaboration that was announced four years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Kojima also commented on the topic of players skipping cutscenes. Talking specifically about the first Death Stranding game, the director said that "cutscenes are part of the game," so he shortened them through the sequel to encourage players to sit through them rather than hit skip.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, while he may be the creator of the seminal Metal Gear series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-he-wont-play-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-laughs"><u>Kojima has said he will not be playing</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater"><u>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</u></a>, the remake of Metal Gear Solid 3, when it drops later this month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
