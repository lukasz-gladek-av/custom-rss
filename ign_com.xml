            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Scientists have identified a new species of ancient whale with cartoonish bulging eyes that they say would have made it look like a Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A precursor to today's modern whale species, the 25 million-year-old creature was "deceptively cute," according to Erich Fitzgerald, senior curator of vertebrate paleontology at Australia's Museums Victoria Research Institute, as reported by the <a href="https://torontosun.com/news/weird/scientists-discover-an-ancient-whale-with-a-pokemon-face-and-a-predator-bite" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toronto Sun</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It might have looked for all the world like some weird kind of mash-up between a whale, a seal and a Pokémon," Fitzgerald said, before clarifying, "but they were very much their own thing."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/australia-prehistoric-whale-298134545-e1755256162696-1755274869824.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The newly-identified <em>Janjucetus dullardi</em>, part whale, part seal, part Pokémon.

Still, much of the species' full appearance remains a mystery, as only a partial skull and teeth have so far been found.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They may have had tiny little nubbins of legs just projecting as stumps from the wall of the body," Fitzgerald continued. Adorable!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Janjucetus dullardi has been placed as a member of the rare mammalodontids group of ancient whales that existed 34-23 million years ago, which later evolved into the humpbacks and minke whales of today. Or in Pokémon terms, it would have definitely been Water-type.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The species has been named after amateur fossil hunter and high school principal Ross Dullard, who contacted Museums Victoria after unearthing the skull on a local beach. Confirming it did indeed belong to a previously-unknown species has since taken six years of research — a lot longer than simply registering it to a Pokédex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, however, has finally brought that confirmation — something Dullard says has given him "the greatest 24 hours of my life" and "high fives coming left, right and center" when he was greeted on his high school campus the following day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's taken my concentration for six years," Dullard said. "I've had sleepless nights. I've dreamt about this whale."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, how about returning it to life, Helix Fossil style?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-the-old-country"><u>Mafia: The Old Country</u></a> developer Hangar 13 has confirmed Free Ride mode is coming to the game as part of a free update for all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hangar 13 also revealed "new activities and gameplay" are coming as part of the free update, which is due out in "the coming months."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer didn't offer any more information, but did issue the image, below, to tease Free Ride:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/mafia-1755271779999.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If The Old Country's Free Ride mode works like it does in previous Mafia games, it'll let players explore the game's environments without any mission objectives. Essentially, it's an opportunity to check out the beautiful vistas, test drive the vehicles in your garage, find collectibles out in the world, and maybe uncover a few secrets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Free Ride harkens back to the 2002 original Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven, which let you explore the 1930s landscape at your own pace. "Confusingly, there were two versions of Free Ride in the original game," Ondřej Vévoda, Lead Designer at Hangar 13, <a href="https://mafia.2k.com/en-GB/news/mafia-definitive-edition-free-ride-mode/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained when Free Ride came to Mafia: Definitive Edition</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There was 'Free Ride,' a city tourism mode with very simple taxi-driving type gameplay, and 'Free Ride Extreme,' which added some crazy challenges. We combined ideas from both into one mode, so the Definitive Edition version of Free Ride contains both the tourism part and some hidden bonus content to discover."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While publisher 2K is yet to comment on the game's performance, Mafia: The Old Country surpassed 800,000 unit sales across Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox in its first four days, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vginsights_mafiatheoldcountry-hangar13-2k-activity-7361305503299186688-QyHf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Sensor Tower</u></a> data. PlayStation leads the way with around 48% of total sales, while Steam contributes roughly one-third of the total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The robust early sales underline the enduring appeal of the Mafia IP and validate the studio’s choice to deliver a linear, narrative-driven experience with cinematic presentation," the analyst firm said. "The stronger performance on PlayStation may reflect the platform’s strategic alignment with story-focused single-player games." Mafia: The Old Country launched priced $50, which will have also encouraged sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-review"><u>IGN's Mafia: The Old Country review</u></a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Mafia: The Old Country is a conventional but effective return to the linear and tightly story-driven format of the original Mafia and Mafia II, and it boasts a wonderful eye and ear for detail."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
