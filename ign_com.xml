"Modify existing content or create new experiences — animations, weapons, mechanics, and even wonders of the Zone."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sounds great, right? Which it is, if you happen to have 700GB of space free… on <em>top</em> of the 160GB you need to run the base game itself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason, GSC said, is because as part of its partnership with the modding community, the team is sharing a slew of uncompressed files so modders are using original assets in the development of their mods, which is better for everyone, of course. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The size of the mod kit is a result of the in-game assets being uncompressed for the mod makers," GSC told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/wanna-make-mods-for-stalker-2-thatll-be-700-gb-of-hard-drive-space-please/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PC Gamer</u></a>. "It's a big game, and the assets are many, resulting in a considerable size of the download. The Zone Kit is currently in phase one, so we'll explore the opportunities to optimize its size (if possible) in the future."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah, we launched the Zone Kit as Phase 1, because we want to develop it together with Mod Makers," a community representative explained on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1lk2rgf/comment/mzojm1h/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit</u></a>. "It already has a lot of features, but still this is Phase 1. On Phase 2 there will be even more things to do with the Zone via the Zone Kit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Underneath the technical problems that plague STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a unique greatness," we wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review"><u>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl review</u></a>, giving it 8/10.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation 5 owners who have already completed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> report a surprising inclusion within the Sony-published game's credits: Nintendo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, the company listed within the credits is Nintendo Pictures, the Mario maker's motion capture studio it bought and rebranded in 2022.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the first time that Nintendo Pictures has been credited as having contributed to a non-Nintendo game since it was acquired, though as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-owned-company-worked-on-death-stranding-2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a> reports, there may be a good reason why.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Death Stranding 2 development was underway in 2022, around the time Nintendo snapped up the company, previously known as Dynamo Pictures. Indeed, the game's reveal trailer, shown at The Game Awards 2022, features a first look at scenes with Norman Reedus and Lea Seydoux that look to have been shot using motion capture.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems probable, then, that Nintendo Pictures (or rather, Dynamo Pictures) was simply signed onto the project before Nintendo's purchase, and continued work on it per its contract. The company previously worked on the original Death Stranding, so it seems likely its services were retained relatively early.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Pictures staff members who worked on Death Stranding 2 include a motion capture director, numerous motion capture editors, motion capture coordinators, and a motion capture advisor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the acquisition, Nintendo Pictures has otherwise focused entirely on projects from its namesake, including Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Pikmin 4, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Whether the company will work on any other non-Nintendo projects now remains to be seen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting started with Death Stranding 2?

In this article, you'll find a list of all the active and working Persona 5: The Phantom X codes in June 2025 that you can redeem for free rewards and bonuses in P5X on PC, iOS, and Android.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/persona5thephantomxstudentlifetrailer-ign-blogroll-1750702407778.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Active Persona 5: The Phantom X Codes (June 2025)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>There are currently no active Persona 5: The Phantom X codes</strong>. Seeing as the game has just released in the West, it's likely we'll see at least one new code in the coming days. Stay tuned as we'll update this page as soon as new codes are released.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Note that there are some active codes for the Chinese version of P5X, but these cannot be redeemed in the global version.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">All Expired P5X Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are currently <strong>no expired Persona 5: The Phantom X codes</strong> as of June 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Redeem P5X Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">To redeem P5X codes in Persona 5: The Phantom X, follow the steps below:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Complete the <strong>Prologue: Discover a Secret World</strong>. This takes around 15 minutes after starting the game for the first time.</li><li>Open the main menu.</li><li>Click on "Exchange Code."</li><li>Input your code into the box.</li><li>Click on "Confirm."</li><li>If your code is valid, you'll obtain your free rewards.</li></ol><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/26/p5x-redeem-code-1750910786770.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Isn't My P5X Code Working?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If the code you're trying to redeem in Persona 5: The Phantom X isn't working, it's likely because of one of two reasons:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The P5X code is expired</li><li>There's a spelling mistake in the code</li><li>The code is region-locked</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">When inputting a P5X code, ensure it's spelled correctly (for example, a zero isn't a capital O, a lowercase L isn't a capital I, etc.) and that there are no spaces before or after the code.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If your P5X code still isn't working after checking for typos, it's more than likely expired and can no longer be redeemed in Persona 5: The Phantom X. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes, the developer releases codes that can only be redeemed in specific regions, so if you find a code online that you can't redeem in your game, this could also be why.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Get More P5X Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">To find more Persona 5: The Phantom X codes, the best way is to join <a href="https://discord.gg/Gb9Te6Gn" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>the game's official Discord server</strong></a>. Codes may also be posted on <a href="https://x.com/P5XOfficialWest" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>the P5X X account</strong></a>, so we'd recommend turning notifications on for that so you can be notified every time there's a new post in case they're posted there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, you can bookmark this page too, as we check for new P5X codes regularly and update it each time there's a new code.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Persona 5: The Phantom X?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona 5: The Phantom X is a gacha spinoff of the popular ATLUS RPG, Persona 5. Like in Persona 5, you attend school and answer classroom questions, forge bonds with characters, and explore various dungeons. You pull for new characters and weapons via gacha banners, which can then be used in combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Meg Koepp is a Guides Editor on the IGN Guides team, with a focus on trends.
