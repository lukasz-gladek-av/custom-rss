There are all sorts of rumors floating around about potential Fallout remakes now that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is out the door (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document">Fallout 3 Remastered was leaked back in 2023</a>, but those plans may have changed). And we know Bethesda plans to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5">Fallout 5</a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps it’s more likely that we’ll get further updates on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, which just announced the upcoming Burning Springs update and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walton-goggins-is-set-to-play-the-ghoul-from-the-fallout-tv-show-in-fallout-76-but-how-does-the-character-fit-in-the-fallout-76-timeline">the addition of The Ghoul from Prime Video’s Fallout TV show</a>, featuring the likeness and voice work from Walton Goggins himself. It’s also worth noting that Season 2 of Fallout, which is set in New Vegas, is due out this December, so maybe we’ll get a new trailer or images.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The last we heard on Fallout 5, by the way, was back in June 2024, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success">Bethesda Softworks head Todd Howard said he wasn’t interested in rushing it out the door</a>. Howard opened up about the future of the hit post-apocalyptic RPG series during <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?si=Ua6SywsuPtdIr0yv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with YouTube content creator MrMattyPlays</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For other Fallout games in the future, you know, obviously I can’t talk about those right now, but I would say, sort of rushing through them, or we kind of need to get stuff out that is different than the work we’re doing in 76… we don’t feel like we need to rush any of that," he said. "The Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and storytelling."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76. While fans slowly flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG, it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series reached a new level of attention.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2: Who's Confirmed to Return and Who's New?</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Howard wouldn't budge when it came to desires for a substantial video game release. For him, it comes down to wanting to treat Bethesda's franchises with care.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Totally get the desire for a new kind of mainline single-player game," he said. "And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or now Starfield, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

There were also upgrades to Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming quality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft insisted the new $30 a month Ultimate price reflects “the expanded catalog, new partner benefits, and upgraded cloud gaming experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that didn’t stop fans from reassessing whether Game Pass remained right for them. IGN’s poll on the issue, which now has over 42,000 voters, shows 53.9% of our audience will not subscribe to Game Pass at all. 19.8% said they were going for Ultimate despite the price rise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Microsoft has soldiered on with its Game Pass lineup announcement for October 2025, revealing the games subscribers can expect in a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/08/xbox-game-pass-october-2025-wave-1/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some big first-party hitters in here, including Double Fine’s Keeper, and the Xbox Game Studios’ published Ninja Gaiden 4.
