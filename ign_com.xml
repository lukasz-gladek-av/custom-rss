And yes, that's as specific as publisher Konami is currently willing to get. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-has-an-online-multiplayer-mode-called-fox-hunt-with-completely-different-gameplay-than-metal-gear-online">back in June</a>, Fox Hunt is an entirely new multiplayer offering unrelated to Metal Gear Online, which came bundled with Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots back in 2008. MGO lasted four years, before its servers were switched off in 2012.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Fox Hunt is a completely original online multiplayer mode," said veteran Metal Gear Solid developer Yu Sahara, who now acts as the mode's director, back in June. "Although it shares the same world with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the gameplay is completely different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we say Metal Gear multiplayer, many fans will probably think of Metal Gear Online, but Fox Hunt will be its own new type of mode. We very much appreciate all the long-time fans of MGO who have always wanted to see it make a comeback, but the landscape of multiplayer games has changed a lot since MGO. It took a lot of careful consideration to think about what a new online mode should look like."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sahara continued by saying that Fox Hunt would focus on Metal Gear series' stealth and survival elements, and take "camouflage and hide and go seek to the next level" in order to ensure the mode offered "more than just a shootout."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of Fox Hunt, Delta is a remake of the 2004 classic Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Original Metal Gear creator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-he-wont-play-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-laughs">Hideo Kojima has said he won't be playing</a>, however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The series, which will feature kid-friendly animated episodes just one-minute in length, will launch alongside a major new push by Nintendo for the kid's product market, with a range of toys, picture books, and more released under a new "My Mario" banner. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, this range includes a set of wooden blocks that you can use as amiibo figurines. Other products on the way include a set of plastic tableware, a board book, a backpack, a plushie Mario, rattles and items of baby and toddler clothing including T-shirts and Mario hoodie.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/08/mymario-products-1024x575-1754642331685.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nintendo's My Mario range.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My Mario has interactive elements too, including a My Mario app for smartphones and Switch consoles where you can play with Mario's face, like a 2D version of the Mario 64 start menu. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Hello Mario app will launch for iPhone and Android devices on August 26 in Japan, with the rest of the My Mario range set to arrive there on August 28. Nintendo has plans for an international My Mario launch, it has said, but not until the beginning of 2026.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/08/amiibo-blocks-1024x672-1754642331684.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">My Mario's wooden block set.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While designed for kids, it's easy to see some of these products becoming collector's items — in particular the wooden blocks set which features Mario, Peach, Luigi and Yoshi alongside a range of Mushroom Kingdom props like a Mushroom and Fire Flower. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has said that these figures can be used as their appropriate amiibo in compatible games, adding to their worth — though you'll need to green shell out around $135 for the set (and also, at least until next year, be in the position to buy it from Japan).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Super Mario Bros. celebrates its 40th anniversary on September 13, while the coming year will see the launch of the next Super Mario Movie. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unannounced-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-title-super-mario-world-published-then-pulled-from-nbcuniversal-press-release">Potentially titled Super Mario World</a>, it'll launch in theaters on April 3, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
