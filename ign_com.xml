            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2's second month on the market was another explosive one, at least in the U.S., where it surpassed 2 million units sold life-to-date, putting it 75% ahead of the unit sales pace set by the Nintendo Switch 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is according to monthly data from Circana, whose analysis was shared with IGN by Mat Piscatella. Nintendo Switch 2 sales in July were so strong that July hardware spending reached $384 million, the highest July hardware spend since July 2008. The Switch 2 was the best-selling console for the month of July, and unshockingly is the best-selling console in the U.S. year-to date in terms of both unit and dollar sales, surpassing the PlayStation 5. The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller is now the best-selling accessory of the year in both dollar and unit sales.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-the-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-in-us-history">Already last month</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2 became the fastest-selling game console of all time in the U.S., surpassing the PlayStation 4. When we asked Piscatella at the time if that meant the Switch 2 could outsell the Switch 1, he offered a cautious take:</p><blockquote>What the launch sales of Switch 2 primarily tell us is that they made a lot of Switch 2 to sell at launch. Lifetime sales and launch sales of a console often do not correlate, meaning that some consoles with small launches ended up doing incredibly well lifetime (PS2 only sold 400k in its launch month) while others with big launches ended up not doing as well lifetime. Since launch month demand is rarely satiated by available supply (and it is certainly not a great sign when it is, historically) all we can really get a read on at launch is the confidence of the manufacturer to make so many units available, and the ability of the supply chain to get those units into the market.<p>But having the biggest launch month sales for any new video game hardware platform is a helluva good start.</p></blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the software charts, July was dominated by new releases. EA Sports College Football 26 debuted at No.1 for July and is already the third best-selling game of the year so far in terms of dollar sales. The EA Sports MVP Bundle, which includes both Madden NFL 26 and College Football 26, followed it at No.2 for July and No.12 for the year-to-date. Donkey Kong Bananza debuted at No.3 for the month of July and No.20 for the year so far on Circana's rankings, despite Nintendo not sharing digital sales data. And Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 debuted at No.4 for the month of July.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox was also well-represented again on July's monthly charts. Aside from Tony Hawk, Forza Horizon 5 once again made an appearance thanks to its PlayStation release, this time appearing at No.7. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was at No.5, and Grounded 2 debuted at No.8. For Grounded 2, its appearance seems largely based on its PC release, as it was the best-selling PC game of the month in dollar sales. However, it's nowhere to be found on Xbox's console rankings, likely due to its Game Pass inclusion and more people choosing to use that subscription for the console version. Microsoft also published four of the top-selling games on both PC (Grounded 2, Tony Hawk, Call of Duty, and Minecraft) and PlayStation (Tony Hawk, Call of Duty, Forza, and Minecraft) this month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter: Wilds remains the best-selling game of the year so far, and is still followed by the Oblivion remaster. Overall software spending was up 4% year-over-year to $4.5 billion thanks to growth in both mobile and non-mobile subscriptions, offsetting a drop in console software spending.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Total games spending for the month of July was up 5% year-over-year to $5.1 billion.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">July 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>EA Sports College Football 26 (NEW)</li><li>EA Sports MVP Bundle (2025) (NEW)</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza* (NEW)</li><li>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 (NEW)</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>Grounded 2 (NEW)</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>MLB The Show 25*</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li><li>WWE 2K25</li><li>Elden Ring</li><li>NBA 2K25</li><li>Elden Ring: Nightreign</li><li>Split Fiction</li><li>EA Sports FC 25</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li><li>F1 25</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-outer-worlds-2%E2%80%99s-first-hour-has-layers-and-layers-of-role-playing-opportunities.1281813/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It often takes a sequel to unlock an idea’s full potential. Just look at Assassin’s Creed 2, Mass Effect 2, or Batman: Arkham City – games which erased the imperfections of their predecessors and elevated rough diamonds to all-time-classic status. Based on a new demo I played at gamescom 2025, I’m betting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> is about to join that club. Obsidian’s first trip across its satirical galaxy back in 2019 had plenty going for it, but often felt constricted in scope or fell flat in its delivery. Those are flaws that a second attempt (plus a nice chunk of change from Microsoft’s wallet) could rectify, and it seems that’s exactly what has happened, if The Outer Worlds 2’s hour-long prologue is anything to go by. Its gleaming polish, branching pathways, and rich role-playing opportunities suggest this is the game I’d hoped the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds">Outer Worlds</a> had been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The prologue demo – and thus The Outer Worlds 2 itself – opens on a gorgeous CGI cinematic that introduces the Earth Directorate, a task force that hops around the galaxy taking on corrupt corporations, corrupt governments, and the ultra-corrupt alliances of corporations and governments. More importantly, it is your employer, and your job in all this is to investigate the production of Skip Drives – engines that enable interstellar travel, but rip dangerous holes in the fabric of space with each FTL jump. In this first mission, you’re dispatched to the Arcadian System to infiltrate a lab and work out the Directorate’s next steps in bringing the company behind these hazardous machines to justice. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Within minutes of landing at the lab’s dock, the prologue offers up a multitude of ways to handle its first problem. Unlocking the bulkhead doors to the lab activates the area’s defences, and now you need to get past a small army of combat robots and automated turrets. You could, of course, shoot your way through them, or drop into a crouch and sneak past them, weaving through their sightlines. But those are just your base, vanilla choices. The Outer Worlds 2 also provides a much more interesting set of opportunities thanks to its RPG foundations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, the security booth in which this escapade begins is the final resting place of Cadet Robin Mowry, and rifling through his pockets will reward you with his personnel ID. When the defenses are triggered, you can phone another cadet working elsewhere in the station, impersonate Mowry, and ask for the defences to be shut down. Your new "colleague" will comply… but only if you can navigate a conversation about “mental refreshment.” You see, Mowry recently underwent a chemical lobotomy as punishment for a work misdemeanor, and so you’ll need to perform your verbal coercion without coming across as ungrateful for your life-correcting treatment. A response enabled by using Speech, one of 12 core skills you can build your character around, is the final key to unlocking a safe route to the lab. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not good with words? Well, maybe you’ve built a character who knows how to breach security software. There’s a service duct that leads out of the security booth and towards the mechanic’s control bay, inside of which you can use the Hack skill to disable the area’s defences. And so, in a single objective alone, I was able to identify four different approaches. This is a prologue, of course, and so they are all easily achieved, but it feels like a statement of intent: each challenge will have multiple methods of approach, with unique pathways catering for a variety of specialised character builds. If Obsidian has been able to deliver on this across the entire length and breadth of the campaign, then that’s something to be very excited about.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The RPG is inherently a pretty good genre for rewarding nosy players willing to look beyond the obvious choices, but The Outer Worlds 2 already feels richer than many of its contemporaries.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The approach to choice differed throughout the demo. While that first area was about demonstrating the multiple methods of solving a single problem, later I was presented with quite literally a branching pathway, with each route leading to an area designed to cater to a specific play style. Heading left to Security Ops would take me to a map built around stealth and silent kills, while turning right and progressing through Central Dispatch led to a showcase for conflict and gunplay. I initially opted for the former and soon found myself in an office complex clearly built on the foundational tenets of Deus Ex. Ventilation ducts provided alternate pathways that led to helpful vantage points, while a knife and throwable distraction devices found hidden behind floor panels allowed me to sneakily dispatch the area’s staff. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Security Ops’ main pathway is designed to cater to simple stealth mechanics, but poking around revealed further opportunities that were much more enticing than a basic backstab. In one office, I was able to use my Hack skill to obtain a key card for the Pump Room, a locked building that provided an alternative route to my final objective in the Skip Drive lab. Built into the walls of that area was another set of ducts, which not only allowed me to bypass a guard patrol but also led to a set of switches that enabled the building’s automatic turrets, which happily poked holes in my enemies following a single button press. The RPG is inherently a pretty good genre for rewarding nosy players willing to look beyond the obvious choices, but The Outer Worlds 2 already feels richer than many of its contemporaries, especially this early in its campaign. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the original Outer Worlds was never under scrutiny for a lack of role-playing opportunities. It did, however, receive fair criticism for its soft and mushy shooting. Choosing Central Dispatch on a second playthrough of the prologue was an opportunity to see just how far Obsidian has improved its once-damp weapons, and the good news is that the two on offer in this demo – a pistol and rifle pairing with early 1900s detailing – feel fantastic. The pistol is snappy, with a light kick and a satisfying reload, while the repeating rifle packs a much bigger punch at the cost of a long, lever-action cycle between shots. That latter aspect helps cement The Outer Worlds 2’s vintage-futuristic aesthetic, but more importantly demands use of the Tactical Time Dilation Device, which slows time to a crawl so you can more easily score headshots. Back in 2019, this feature admittedly felt like a knock-off of Fallout’s VATS, but with the improved gunfeel of this sequel, TTDD now comes across more like a genuine bullet time system. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Outer Worlds 2 Gameplay - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to the stealthy, opportunity-filled Security Ops pathway, Central Dispatch was much more limited with what it had to offer. A conversation with the cadet I had fooled with my impersonation of his colleague at the start of the demo turned sour, and he set a squadron of heavy Dragoon robots on me. This did push the combat intensity a little further, but did not come coupled with any inventive approaches that I could identify. Still, the heavier damage the robots inflicted forced me to repeatedly use the Medical Inhaler – a health kit that builds a toxicity meter with every huff. Max out that gauge and you’re forced to wait a duration until you can use it again. It’s a fun riff on Fallout’s drug addiction system, but one that works as a battle constraint rather than a stat impact. It demands you think tactically about when you ingest those HP-restoring chemicals, and while I imagine it could cause a few frustrating deaths in the fiercest battles, I think it’s at the very least an interesting idea worth experimenting with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m always going to take the sneakier or more creative option when it comes to RPGs, and I’ll admit I had a lot more fun in Security Ops than Central Dispatch. But I will say that those short shootouts convinced me that I’ll actually enjoy it when the guns are drawn, something I can’t say about the original game’s underwhelming combat. Like its fantasy sibling Avowed, much of its newfound punch is down to visual polish, and the same level of detail can be felt across the entire prologue. There are bespoke animations for almost every skill – lockpicking sees your character’s hand align a set of pins on a Mag-Pick, hacking sees you arrange the dials on a Bypass Shunt probe before jamming it into a computer terminal, and applying the Engineering skill to a maintenance panel sees you rub your hands in anticipation before twisting and tightening an arrangement of steampunk valves. It feels expensive, but more importantly it connects and anchors you into this fantastical world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If it’s not clear by now, I’m really into what Obsidian is doing with The Outer Worlds 2. The prologue features so many cool opportunities, particularly when it comes to non-combat or combat-adjacent approaches, and I hope that they are all being served up in this opening hour as something of an establishment of the rules – “<em>This </em>is how you can use your character, and similar opportunities await.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I appreciated Obsidian’s prior attempt at this universe, I never totally fell for it, but what the studio has achieved here in this prologue is exactly what I’d hoped for the first time around. And that’s exactly why I’m willing to bet that The Outer Worlds 2 will be one of <em>those </em>sequels. The ones that finally take an idea all the way to greatness. Hopefully, I’ll pass that “prediction” check with a critical success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2s-first-hour-has-layers-and-layers-of-role-playing-opportunities]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s “game + add-on” rereleases have been hard to predict based on that label alone. Super Mario 3D World’s jump to Switch 1 came with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review">Bowser’s Fury</a>, which was essentially an entirely new game, while the more recent Super Mario Party rolled onto Switch 2 with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review">Jamboree TV expansion</a> that was simultaneously the same as the base game but also totally separate and different in a few odd ways. Now it’s Kirby and the Forgotten Land’s turn, and its Star-Crossed World add-on is a Kirby-sized gulp of fresh air simply because of how easy it is to explain: it’s just a regular ol’ modestly-sized DLC. It might be packaged as an upgrade, but this small collection of fun new levels isn’t anything more complicated than a good excuse to hop back onto the warp star for a few hours, even if there’s not much to it overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s get the boring business talk out of the way first: The only ways to access Star-Crossed World are to either pay $20 to upgrade your Switch 1 version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land to the Switch 2 Edition (which also comes with some welcome but inessential performance improvements) or buy the Switch 2 version fresh for $80. You could also buy the Switch 1 version for $60 and skip the added content, but there’s no way to get the Switch 2 enhancements without it. Because those enhancements aren’t very significant, this really does just feel like DLC in a very traditional sense, and as such this review is going to focus on Star-Crossed World alone rather than the bundle it’s being marketed as.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other reason that makes the most sense to me is because my review of Kirby and the Forgotten Land still holds up exactly the same as when I wrote it, three-and-a-half years ago. I won’t be recapping the basics here, so I encourage you to go read or watch that review if you’ve never played it (a game I still heartily recommend on its own), and then come back when you are considering the DLC itself. Here is what I said at the time: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star-Crossed World weaves a little side story nicely into Forgotten Land’s existing campaign. Immediately after you complete the first world (or just as soon as you load it up if you already have a save beyond that), a mysterious meteor crashes into the ocean and sends chunks of blue crystal all across the map. The story, which is not the reason you are here at all, is predictably thin as a Waddle Dee with a cool beret sends you out to collect the “Starries” that have been scattered across the land in order to reseal the evil being inside the meteor that is <em>prophecized to end all existence.</em> Ya know, normal Kirby stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What that means, practically speaking, is that 12 new “Starry Stages” have been added to the map, two in each of the six worlds from the base game. These borrow locations and themes from the levels they are next to, adding crystal flowers that alter the landscape when you touch them. There are also some brand-new enemies, challenges, and even awesome background songs. I was initially concerned that these stages would <em>just</em> be remixes, but that proved not to be the case – they are made up of almost entirely new areas, and the handful of times you do revisit spots like in the excellent mall level or exciting amusement park, it feels entertainingly referential rather than like a cheap rehash. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There aren’t really any misses across the 12 new Starry Stages.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There aren’t really any misses across these dozen dungeons, with clever twists put on existing mechanics and plenty of interesting new ones to tease your brain. One standout had me hopping between moving platforms that were coming toward the screen, frantically trying to find the right path to the next one before getting pushed off the edge. Another revisits the very silly “pipe” Mouthful Mode transformation to send you rolling down a roller coaster track that you need to reveal extra pieces of in real time. None of them put up too serious of a fight, since this <em>is</em> a Kirby game, but they are a bit more challenging than the rest of Forbidden Land across the board, making them a nice additional “post-game” option to keep you playing, even though they actually unlock in tandem with the main story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Mouthful transformations, there are three new ones introduced in Star-Crossed World: a spring that lets you bounce up high and then slam down hard, a gear that allows you to roll along walls, and a sign that essentially turns Kirby into a sled for a few high-speed downhill sections. All of them are used to great effect, opening the door to some clever new puzzle ideas – I particularly liked how you’re asked to launch yourself between separated sections of wall as the gear, which is a little bit more mechanically nuanced than I expected from such a simple item. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the existing transformations are revisited in smart ways as well, with options like the stalwart traffic cone getting multiple sections that prove there is more than a little gas left in the tanks. Even the stairs transformation, which in the main game I thought was… well, pretty dumb, is actually used in interesting ways here: there’s a short section where you have to leave your stairs on a moving conveyor belt then hop up elsewhere to complete a task before it falls off a ledge. Neat! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, Kirby’s more traditional transformations didn’t get the same attention – there are no new ones and no new upgrades for any of the existing set. Perhaps more importantly, if you have already beaten Forgotten Land and are returning to this DLC years later like I did, having a maxed-out toolset already can make some of the beefed-up enemies a bit too easy to shred. One new enemy type in particular acts as a fun little recurring miniboss, calling down meteors that you have to dodge as you break away progressive layers of crystal armor – but a charged-up attack from a fully upgraded copy ability can trivialize that otherwise-interesting encounter from the jump. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kirby and the Forgotten Land: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In that same vein, the failures of Star-Crossed World are less about what it does and more about what it doesn’t. It took me about three hours to finish what’s here, and while the stages themselves are all top notch, it feels slight as an actual expansion beyond that. There are no boss fights across those 12 levels, no new Treasure Road bonus stages (which were a big highlight of the original) even for the new Mouthful options, and nothing really changes back at your Waddle Dee village – although there is a little bit more to see beyond the Starry Stages that I can’t get into here. Even the new star-based currency you collect became fairly uninteresting once I realized that its <em>only</em> use was unlocking a new set of gacha figurines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not like there’s nothing worthwhile here, and it’s not like I got 100% completion across those 12 stages right away – just like the base game, I didn’t usually make it to the end with every single collectible on my first try, so there’s plenty more secrets left for me to sniff out. But Star-Crossed World can’t help but feel like a drop in the bucket when you compare it to everything that was already available. The levels it adds are great, but that single afternoon of fresh platforming is pretty close to the entire package.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition changes don’t do much to entice you, either. You’ll no longer see NPCs in the distance moving at comically low frame rates, but that’s the only change that really jumped out at me. Don’t get me wrong, the higher FPS and resolution are welcome, and it all looks quite nice… but it didn’t really look bad to begin with. Forgotten Land was such a stylized game already, one without any of the real performance issues other Switch 1 games were able to fix in the jump to Switch 2, so the ceiling on how much better it could look without a more substantial overhaul wasn’t too high in my eyes. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-review]]></content:encoded>
