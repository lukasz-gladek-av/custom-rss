Indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3">Space Marine 2 has done so well it ‚Äúchanges everything‚Äù for Saber Interactive</a>, Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN soon after the game came out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But via <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/ost7hseic9hc/1alE9DriNd0GJq1SYKn3ZY/e14d3ff03635ea919c569f075b25c60a/2024-25_half_year_report_final.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new financial results</a> we now know just how much money it has made for Games Workshop, the British company behind the tabletop hobby upon which Space Marine 2 is based. Reporting results for the first half of its financial year ending December 1, 2024, Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree hailed the success of Space Marine 2, which contributed significant royalty revenue to the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, licensing revenue from royalty income increased in the period by a whopping ¬£18 million (approx. $21.9 million) to ¬£30.1 million (approx. $36.7 million). Earned income, which is the key figure here, was ¬£26.1 million (approx. $31.8 million), up from ¬£5.9 million (approx. $7.2 million), an increase Games Workshop said was mainly from Space Marine 2. 98% of Games Workshop‚Äôs total licensing revenue came from PC and console games (Space Marine 2 launched on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A win all round, then. As you'd expect, Games Workshop is on the hunt for the next blockbuster Warhammer video game, but Rountree also expressed a degree of caution on potential future video game success, admitting hits like Space Marine 2 are few and far between.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here‚Äôs the statement:</p><blockquote>During the period, our licensing partners launched two new video games; Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, a third person shooter for PC and console and Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks, a combat racing game. Established games continue to contribute, alongside royalty income earned following the success of Space Marine 2. We recognise that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games. Clearly we are looking for the next one. We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">So, where could this big Warhammer video game hit come from? It seems inevitable that Saber Interactive will get the chance to continue the Space Marine story with Space Marine 3, and indeed has said it has ideas for a third game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Bulwark Studios‚Äô turn-based tactics game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-mechanicus-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus II</a> looks set to scratch a very different itch. There are also rumblings that Creative Assembly is finally giving Warhammer 40,000 the Total War treatment, something fans have hoped for for years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Space Marine 2, Saber continues to update the game with cosmetics, new Operations, and new weapons. Season 3 is set for launch this spring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Alongside some new armore and exotic weapons, the biggest feature in the update is a new Offline Mode that will allow players to continue playing Suicide Squad Game by themselves without requiring an internet connection.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">As a reminder, Episode 8 will be the final update to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuicideSquadGame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#SuicideSquadGame</a>. The title will remain playable in both Online and the recently released Offline Mode for players to continue to wreak havoc in Metropolis üí•</p>‚Äî Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League (@suicidesquadRS) <a href="https://twitter.com/suicidesquadRS/status/1879238211643605436?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Offline Mode was announced in December 2023 as part of Rocksteady's post-launch plans, but the studio was also committed to releasing its promised DLCs and additional characters, leaving the Offline Mode for its final update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a big comic book ending to wrap up the story of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, <strong>so if you're okay with spoilers feel free to read below the break. You've been warned.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay so Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, as the name implies, is about taking out members of the Justice League who have been brainwashed by Brainiac. One of the biggest shocks in the game was when Harley Quinn <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kevin-conroys-batman-is-completely-wasted-in-suicide-squad">shoots Batman point blank in the head</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Batman was actually still alive. In his masterful gambit, he allowed Brainiac to create clones of the Justice League and then oversaw the events of the game from the shadows as he worked to take down Brainiac in secret.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ending is told via the comic book illustrations that the different post-launch episodes have been presented in and in true comic book fashion, your favorite heroes are still all alive and the bad guys are defeated. Woo-hoo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this how Rocksteady envisioned the end of Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League? Who can say. The game released to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-worst-reviewed-games-of-2024">mixed reviews</a> and Warner Bros. said the game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">fell short of expectations</a> when it came to sales, and the developers announced that it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-confirms-its-pulling-the-plug-on-new-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-content-after-season-4">ending future updates</a> on the game after Season 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can read our full review of Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League here and for anyone looking to play the game, the Offline Mode means you're able to fully. So if you see it on sale next time, don't worry about picking it up as the game will still run just fine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

He doesn‚Äôt mince words, promising to release a playable character every half-season. That equals out to at least one new hero every month and a half, or roughly every six weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúEvery season we‚Äôll be rolling out fresh seasonal stories, new maps, and new heroes. We‚Äôll actually be breaking down each season into two halves,‚Äù Chen said. ‚ÄúThe length of one season is three months. And for each half of the season, we will introduce a new hero. We just eventually want to continue to enhance the experience, and, you know, keep everyone excited in our community.‚Äù</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs a tall order that will leave fans with one question as every season winds down: who‚Äôs next? Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls already kicked things off with a strong start by introducing both Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman for the first half, with The Thing and the Human Torch primed to launch with the second half in a few weeks. These are Marvel mainstays who have undeniably earned their place as legendary superhero characters, but keeping up that momentum over time will be quite the challenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals already launched with a strong list of playable heroes that includes names like Wolverine, Magneto, Spider-Man, Jeff the Landshark, and Storm, but there are so many other faces to include. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-blade-first-look-image-and-in-game-lore-leak-suggests-season-2-release"><u>Blade is one character rumored to appear</u></a> in Season 2, for example, with fans also hoping to see characters like Daredevil, Deadpool, and other X-Men at some point. It‚Äôs unclear how NetEase will expand upon the Marvel Rivals roster in the future, but with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-a-smash-hit-with-10-million-players-in-just-3-days"><u>the success it‚Äôs seen so far</u></a>, the team is showing no signs of slowing down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals Season 1 also introduced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-confirms-nerfs-and-buffs-coming-with-season-1-balance-changes"><u>a laundry list of balance changes</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-update-patch-notes-detail-tournament-changes-and-bug-fixes"><u>general gameplay tweaks</u></a>, with more promised to arrive in future updates.
