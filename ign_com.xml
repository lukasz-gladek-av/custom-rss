We spoke to them at length the day before the release about everything Sonic: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-film-writers-reveal-the-big-the-cat-cameo-that-almost-was">Big the Cat</a>, their inspirations, whether or not Chaos are real... you know, the important questions. And we <em>also</em> learned about their dream video game adaptations, which include A Boy and His Blob, Golden Axe, and... The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN, Casey and Miller reminded us that they're signed on to write a script for an upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dwayne-johnson-executive-produce-it-takes-two-movie">It Takes Two film adaptation produced by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</a>, and also hinted that they were working on some other unannounced adaptations they couldn't talk about. But as for things they are definitely not currently working on but would love to?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've talked about Golden Axe," Casey suggests. "Golden Axe was another good Genesis multiplayer game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Miller throws in A Boy and His Blob, and Casey responds with "the 7-Up game about the dot having a platforming adventure." He's referring to Cool Spot, a 1993 platformer starring the red dot from the 7-Up logo. But Miller concludes with a far more exciting suggestion: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think another easy one I think we can answer because the movie's already happening and we're already not doing it would be a Zelda," he says. "I remember always when we played Wind Waker, we were always like, man, I mean, it would probably be weird if they made a Zelda movie to start with Wind Waker versus the more classic Hyrule. But we both loved Wind Waker and it's so cinematic. Yeah. So after they make this Zelda movie, I guess we're putting it out there in the world, maybe we can do a Wind Waker spin-off."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don't know much about Nintendo and Sony's partnership on a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-live-action">The Legend of Zelda movie</a>. We know it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-is-making-a-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie">planned to be live-action</a>, that it's directed by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/18/the-maze-runner-review">The Maze Runner</a>'s Wes Ball, and that it'll be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-at-least-we-know-the-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-will-be-released-before-the-end-of-the-decade">out before the end of the decade</a>. And, I guess, that Pat Casey and Josh Miller are <em>not</em> writing it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keep your eyes here at IGN for our full interview with Casey and Miller coming later this week, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-3">all the latest on the Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
