Don't take that risk, a lot of gamers aren't gonna pay 80 dollars and feed this notion of constant increase of the price tag. You are the CEO, you have some say with the price when it comes to your publisher."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here's Randy Pitchford's response:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A) Not my call. B) If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen. My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlor in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The response to Pitchford’s tweet has been mostly negative. “I am going to pirate Borderlands 4,” said one X / Twitter user. “Please stop. Just apologize and move on. This isn't fair on your developers. If you care about them, just do the right thing dude,” added another. “Randy we are begging you to stop. BL4 had so much hype and it’s being ruined in a day. Let people want to like and support the game and all the amazing people who made it,” said one commenter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Pitchford has yet to apologize directly for his comments, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-backlash-to-80-borderlands-4-if-youre-a-real-fan-comment-randy-pitchford-points-to-previous-statement-if-you-want-the-truth-here-it-is"><u>he did point to</u> a recent answer he gave on-stage at PAX East on Borderlands 4's price</a>, saying: “If you want the truth, here it is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, Pitchford inched closer to an <em>actual</em> apology after <a href="https://x.com/MoxsyOG/status/1925249239149412373" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Borderlands streamer Moxsy tweeted</a> dialogue from a Handsome Jack AI prompted by a user called Duke_Newcombe who fed it Pitchford's original tweet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(Handsome Jack is the main antagonist of Borderlands 2 and self-appointed dictator of Pandora.)</p><blockquote>Ohhh boo-hoo, $80 for Borderlands 4? Let me break out the world’s tiniest violin—crafted from Eridium and oiled with the tears of whiny Vault Hunters.</blockquote><blockquote>Listen, cupcake, you’re not buying a game. You’re investing in a premium, galaxy-shattering experience personally engineered to blast your sad little dopamine receptors into orbit. You think quality loot and chaotic mayhem just code itself? You want guns that sprout legs, sing sea shanties, and explode into loot goblins without paying top dollar? Grow up.</blockquote><blockquote>Back in my day, I built an entire moonbase with my own two hands (and a metric ton of disposable Hyperion interns), and you’re crying about spending a few bucks more to virtually murder skags with style? Puh-lease.</blockquote><blockquote>But hey, if $80 is too steep, there’s always a solution: just don’t buy it. More legendary drops for the rest of us, and fewer mouth-breathing freeloaders clogging up my loot pools. Win-win.</blockquote><blockquote>Stay broke, hero.</blockquote><blockquote>•⁠Handsome Jack President of the Galaxy, CEO of Hyperion, and your personal nightmare</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/22/pitchford-1747909471374.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Randy Pitchford: "Back to work for me!" Photo by Monica Schipper/WireImage.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Boy howdy, JackGPT, is that how I sound? My bad, but cheers to Duke_Newcombe and @MoxsyOG for the funniest thing I’m going to read today!” <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1925396048828404016" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitchford tweeted</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In seriousness though, nobody likes being taken for granted and it was not my intent. I’m humbled by the love and support everyone has shown the team as we push hard to get this amazing game in your hands. They’re crushing it, and I can’t wait for everyone to play what’s going to be the best Borderlands ever! Regardless of where the price lands, it’s going to be worth it and then some. Back to work for me!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford, clearly, would like to draw a line under this week’s self-inflicted drama, but it seems likely the debate about Borderlands 4’s price will resurface as soon as pre-orders go live. At that point, publisher 2K Games will have to announce the price of the game, and whether it’s $80 or $70 or something else, it will be a bigger talking point now than it might have been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Monica Schipper/WireImage.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dystopian-google-ai-video-generator-generating-fake-fortnite-clips-and-its-tough-to-tell-the-difference<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Google has launched an advanced AI video generation tool capable of creating <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> gameplay clips that look almost indistinguishable from the real thing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Veo 3 launched this week and has already raised eyebrows for its dystopian ability to create life-like video clips from simple text-based prompts and include realistic-sounding audio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other generative AI programs, such as OpenAI's Sora, have been doing similar for some time — but the ability for Veo 3 to include lifelike audio really is a remarkable, if chilling, step forward.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Veo 3 users are still testing out what the tool is capable of, but within two days have begun producing Fortnite gameplay with a fake streamer commenting over the top. The quality is good enough that, while scrolling on social media, you'd think it was a legimate clip from YouTube or Twitch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Technically, Veo 3 should not be infringing on anyone's copyrighted material — and it's safe to assume Fortnite developer Epic Games did not sign this one off. But clearly the AI tool has had access to the millions of hours of Fortnite gameplay posted online, and is now able to reproduce a convincing representation on command.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One <a href="https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/1924994290729599222" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clip</a>, showing a streamer celebrating as they win a match using only their pickaxe, was apparently created within Veo 3 using a text-based prompt of nine words: "Streamer getting a victory royale with just his pickaxe".</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Uhhh... I don't think Veo 3 is supposed to be generating Fortnite gameplay <a href="https://t.co/bWKruQ5Nox" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/bWKruQ5Nox</a></p>— Matt Shumer (@mattshumer_) <a href="https://twitter.com/mattshumer_/status/1924994290729599222?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In writing this prompt, Veo 3 has not been told specifically to create Fortnite gameplay. Still, it understands from the context what game the user is referring to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Veo 3's abilities throw up all sorts of questions, and far more pressing ones than simple copyright concerns. The ability to create footage like this undoubtedly aids users looking to fool others with disinformation, and in so doing undermine trust in legitimate footage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can not tell if this is real or not," reads one reply. "We're cooked," reads another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The only way this is possible is if Veo 3 was trained on an enormous amount of Fortnite content," a third reply reads. "Wouldn’t be surprised if everything that gets uploaded to YouTube is now being trained on despite copyright laws."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Epic for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a better look at what Veo 3 is capable of outside of video games, here's a clip of the algorithm creating a fake news report on an automobile trade show that doesn't exist, with fake interviewees answering fake questions.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Before you ask: yes, everything is AI here. The video and sound both coming from a single text prompt using <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Veo3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Veo3</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleDeepMind?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@GoogleDeepMind</a> .Whoever is cooking the model, let him cook!

Xbox boss Phil Spencer suggested Muse could be used to help ideate game concepts in the future, and even somehow aid in game preservation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Muse's reveal, quickly followed by the reveal of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-quake-2-ai-prototype-sparks-debate-online">more fake gameplay footage generated by Muse of the classic shooter Quake 2</a>, has prompted further debate — and raised questions over whether the tool would remove work or replace human creativity from existing employees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite is no stranger to AI itself, of course. Last week, the game added the ability to chat with Star Wars' Darth Vader, who will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-has-only-been-live-for-an-hour-and-already-epic-has-patched-out-him-saying-fk">reply using generative AI trained on the voice of the late James Earl Jones</a>. Jones' voice is officially licensed (and was previously used to create dialogue for Disney's own Obi Wan Kenobi TV series) and sanctioned by both the late actor and his family, but the addition still prompted <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/voice-actor-union-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-over-fortnites-ai-darth-vader">swift condemnation and an unfair labor practice charge from acting union SAG-AFTRA</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

It doesn't make it clear what the problem is, you'll just know the code hasn't worked. The good news is, if you use our article, we'll move codes into expired when they stop working, so you can tell the difference. If a code is in the active and working list, however, be sure to copy and paste it exactly as you see it here. We test each of the codes before uploading them, and Roblox codes are often case-sensitive, so it's important that it's exact. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
