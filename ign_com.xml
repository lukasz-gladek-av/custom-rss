He is suspected of modifying Switch consoles to run pirated games before selling them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was allegedly done by welding modified parts to the circuit boards of second-hand consoles that allowed them to run pirated games. The man is accused of loading the hardware with 27 illegally accessed games and selling the consoles for ¥28,000 (around $180) each.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He has admitted to the charges and is currently being investigated for other possible violations, according to police.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Video game companies like Nintendo have long battled with piracy. A takedown request in May 2024, for example, saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-takedown-request-targets-over-8500-copies-of-switch-emulator-yuzu">Nintendo target 8,500 copies of Switch emulator Yuzu</a> after the emulator itself was taken down two months prior. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settled-for-24-million-between-nintendo-and-tropic-haze">Its initial lawsuit against creator </a><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settled-for-24-million-between-nintendo-and-tropic-haze">Tropic Haze</a> said <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aign.com+-za.ign.com+-in.ign.com+-sea.ign.com+-me.ign.com+-za.ign.com+-nordic.ign.com+tears+of+the+kingdom+70%23&amp;oq=site%3Aign.com+-za.ign.com+-in.ign.com+-sea.ign.com+-me.ign.com+-za.ign.com+-nordic.ign.com+tears+of+the+kingdom+70%23&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg60gEINDYzNmowajGoAgCwAgA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the $70 game</a> The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">Nintendo's premiere video game release of 2023</a>, had been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-tears-of-the-kingdom-was-pirated-1-million-times-pre-release-in-lawsuit-against-emulator-creator">pirated one million times before it was even released</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Legal action like this is becoming more and more common in an attempt to thwart piracy, however.

Nintendo's Assistant Manager of the Intellectual Property Division, Koji Nishiura, said: “To begin with, are emulators illegal or not? This is a point often debated. While you can’t immediately claim that an emulator is illegal in itself, it can become illegal depending on how it’s used.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image Credit: Nintendo</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

A remaster (Sony loves a remaster)? A sequel? A next-gen update? Fans of FromSoftware’s PlayStation 4 masterpiece have begged for more ever since the game launched to critical and commercial acclaim a decade ago. So, what gives?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh from the reveal of his first voice acting gig following his exit from Sony, PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida has delivered his Bloodborne no-show theory. And we must be clear up front: this is Yoshida’s opinion, which in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Kinda Funny Games</a> he stressed is not inside information, or the reveal of the current deliberations within the bowels of Sony itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing,” Yoshida began. “And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s unpack Shuhei’s comment here. Miyazaki-san is of course Hidetaka Miyazaki, the boss of FromSoftware. And yes, he’s incredibly successful. Not only for the influential Dark Souls series, but, most recently, the mainstream hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>, which propelled FromSoftware to new heights. So much so that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service">it’s getting a multiplayer spin-off this year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it seems obvious to say Miyazaki will be incredibly busy with multiple projects to direct and a company to run. After Bloodborne came out in 2015, Miyazaki directed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>, then 2019’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> for Activision, then the aforementioned Elden Ring for Bandai Namco. What's next? Miyazaki has yet to say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Shuhei is touching on here is a potential desire from Miyazaki to do something with Bloodborne, but he doesn’t want anyone else to do it. And Sony, Shuhei suggests, respects that wish, despite owning the intellectual property. Certainly Miyazaki has earned that respect and the ability to pick and choose his projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is Bloodborne remains dormant nearly 10 years after the first game came out. But is there hope? In interviews, Miyazaki often deflects questions about Bloodborne, pointing to the fact FromSoftware does not own the IP. But in February last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5">Miyazaki at least admitted the game would benefit from a release on more modern hardware</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Sony, some Bloodborne fans feel a tad… trolled by PlayStation. For example, last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-fans-freak-out-again-as-playstation-anniversary-trailer-ends-on-bloodborne-and-the-phrase-its-about-persistence">Bloodborne fans freaked out over a potential announcement</a> after Sony ended its special PlayStation 30th Anniversary trailer with a clip from the beloved FromSoftware game and the phrase "it's about persistence."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps, given Shuhei’s theory, fans will need plenty of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
