            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-may-9<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Another week, another hectic shift in the Pokémon single card market whilst trainers are waiting for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-destined-rivals-preorder-guide-2025">Destined Rivals</a> to drop. At least the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-where-to-buy">Black Bolt and White Flare Pokémon Center preorders</a> avoided a hostile bot takeover this time around. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most dramatic crash this week is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObXmY?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greninja ex 214/167</a>, crashing by nearly half when compared the the start of this year. We're also seeing some nice price drops across Obsidian Flames and the elusive 151 expansions. Meanwhile, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1EVR?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dragonite V</a> from Evolving Skies is doing the opposite, nearly doubling in value compared to the start of this year, and the artwork alone always made this card undervalued. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2Krn?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charizard V Alt Art</a> is also a banger, depicting a Pokémon battle against Venusaur whilst slowly climbing up in value. But <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnxlX?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rayquazza VMAX Alt Art</a> is quite literally soaring high, scoring an extra $100 in value since the start of this year. Let's dig into all the rest of the biggest Pokémon TCG climbers and crashers of the week.</p><p id="card-crashes"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Card Crashes">Pokémon Card Crashes</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/09/pixel-9-2025-05-09t113825-747-1746803600091.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst we're finally seeing a noticeable climb in Sword and Shield era Pokémon Cards, Scarlet and Violet series cards are settling back down into the realm of reality for the most part. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7O2x7?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alakazam ex SIR</a> from 151 is a georgous card, and it's 34% lower in price than the beggining of March. There's absolutley no reason for not having Uri Gellars Grandad claiming a spot in your binder this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bulbasaur was my first starter Pokémon when I first loaded up Pokémon Blue way back when, so this <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GkpE?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bulbasaur IR</a> has a special place in my heart. This card has dropped by a massive 52% since mid-March, so there's no reason to not catch this beautiful card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving onto Obsidian Flames, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7O2x7?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ninetales IR</a> has always been one of the best cards of the set. If you agree then it's time to snap this card up seeing as it's crashed by 40% from Feburary so a reasonable $18.17.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">People can complain about Obsidian Flames all they want, but it's <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yDqpr?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charizard ex SIR</a> so cool. Rocking a stained glass look in it's Tera form, it's a show stopper for sure. Granted it's not come down too much since March, but $5 less is $5 saved. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally the biggest crasher this month is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObXmY?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greninja ex SIR</a>, which at one point was set to become the most expensive Scarlet and Violet era card. Then Prismatic Evolutions came along and took the FOMO up 10 notches. It's still a class card that's holding it's weight at $275, but imagine reading this and paying $411.62 at the end of Feburary. Oh dear.</p><p id="card-climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Card Climbers">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/09/pixel-9-2025-05-09t161701-761-1746804035935.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving onto this weeks climbers, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnxlX?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rayquazza VMAX alt art</a> is one of the main grails of the Sword and Shield era. It was already a $500+ card, but at $649.99 it shows no signs of slowing down. This could arguably hit the $1,000 mark in a few years, so i'd get one fi you can afford it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There can't be enough Kanto love in my book, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2Krn?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charizard V Alt Art</a> smashes it out of the park with this Venusaur battle. The angle is great and it feels like a moving card instead of a static body shot so many Pokémon cards are guilty of (Looking at you, WotC era). It's earned another $40 since January, and there's no reason why this card can't get over $200 before the year is out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1EVR?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dragonite V Alt Art</a> is one of the highlights of Evolving Skies. It's a fan favorite Pokémon that can look cute as hell or ready to rip another mon's face off. It's a full package that looks nothing like it's pre evolutions, but that's ok because it's Dragonite. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's cute side comes out in this artwork, and that's exactly why it's nearly doubled in value since the middle of January. It's now rocking a solid $225, so make sure to grab yours before it flies any higher. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-biggest-crashers-and-climbers-of-the-week-may-2">Did you catch last week's article</a>? There are some bangers on there too.</p><p id="sealed-boosters"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sealed Boosters">Pokémon Card Sealed Boosters</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've dedicated your life to pulling chase cards yourself, here's what we can find in stock right now. Just watch out for pricing over MSRP, we're in a wierd spot as Pokémon trainers right now, so don't pay more than what you have too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Pokémon TCG full Release Schedule</a> so far for this year too so you don't miss anything.

Freddy Fazbear and his animatronic-filled pizza emporium headline Behviour’s plans for this year’s anniversary chapter, which is expected to arrive in June.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lillard, who starred as William Afton in 2023’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy’s movie</a> adaptation, has embodied the spirit of the role once again to lend his likeness and record new voice lines for Dead by Daylight’s latest Killer: Springtrap. This evil animatronic bunny, otherwise known as Yellow Rabbit or Spring Bonnie, will be available as a Legendary Outfit when the collection eventually arrives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Behaviour calls Five Nights at Freddy’s the “most requested license in Dead by Daylight history,” so fans should be excited to hear that the content drop will also include a Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza map that is said to be filled with a buffet of Easter Eggs and surprises to uncover. More news, including a specific release date, is expected to arrive in the near future.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/09/dbd-fnaf-key-art-1746758440373.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/09/dbd-fnaf-map-exterior-screenshot-1746758445776.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Five Nights at Freddy's comes to Dead by Daylight. Image courtesy of Behaviour Interactive.</figcaption></figure></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Wind’s Howling</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A Five Nights at Freddy’s Dead by Daylight crossover has been a long time coming, but it’s not the only gaming collaboration in the cards. Also revealed at PAX East was the news that CD Projekt Red’s The Witcher series is also set to make an appearance in Behviour’s hit horror experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The set will make its mark as a special Witcher Collection June 3 and includes outfits inspired by the popular fantasy RPG universe. This includes a Legendary piece inspired by the White Wolf himself, Geralt of Rivia, as well as Very Rare outfits for Yennefer, Ciri, Triss, and Eredin. As an added bonus, those who pick up the Geralt costume will notice that original voice actor Doug Cockle contributed new voice lines just for this very occasion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our favorite of the Collection is, of course, Geralt’s Legendary Outfit for Vittorio Toscano,” Dead by Daylight Product Director Rose Li said in a statement. “Not only will it let players essentially take on the exact look of The White Wolf, but we’ve also added some really nice details as part of this Outfit. Geralt will have unique lobby animations, and best of all, brand-new voice lines recorded for our game by the original voice actor, Doug Cockle.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragula, Shudder’s monster-themed drag reality competition series, is also doubling down on its relationship with Dead by Daylight. Players can look forward to picking up a Boulet Brothers Collection come July 8, which includes a Winter Warrior outfit for The Huntress and the Boulet Brothers Artist outfit for The Artist.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Witcher x Dead by Daylight Screenshots</h3></div></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Blood, Sweat, and Tears</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Also included in Behaviour’s PAX East showcase was the promise that the team will deliver fresh quality of life updates throughout 2025 and beyond. June highlights include a The Archives revamp and adjusted Gamma Settings, with the months ahead set to bring updates that add more spectators in Custom Matches, map and key item rebalancing, an MMR rework, and more balance tweaks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative Director Dave Richard also teased something completely new: a Dead by Daylight Chapter entirely created by fans.
