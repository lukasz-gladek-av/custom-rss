Right now you can configure one starting at just $1,699.99 with free delivery. The RTX 5070 Ti graphics card can run any game at 60fps even in 4K, including the upcoming Battlefield 6.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Alienware Aurora R16 RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC for $1,699.99</h2><div catalogid="a25177bf-886b-4d72-b109-40de6e2e9e15" id="223030"><div id="223030" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alienware Aurora R16 Intel Core Ultra 7 265F RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Th base configuration is equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 7 265F processor, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB graphics card, 16GB of DDR5-5600MHz RAM, and a 1TB M.2 SSD. The system is powered by a 1000W 80Plus Platinum power supply.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Core Ultra 7 265F is part of Intel's newest Arrow Lake-S lineup released earlier this year and boasts a max turbo frequency of 5.3GHz with 20 cores and a 36MB L2 cache. This is a great all-around CPU for gaming, multi-tasking, and general workstation performance. It doesn't have as many cores as a Core Ultra 9 processor, but that doesn't matter for gaming since the vast majority of games will not be able to utilize more than 20 cores. The processor is air cooled by a tower heatsink and fan combo, but you can upgrade to 240mm all-in-one liquid cooling for an extra $50.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The RTX 5070 Ti GPU Has Excellent 4K Gaming Performance</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all the Blackwell cards released thus far, the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck, especially when pitted against the previous generation GPUs. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. Like all Blackwell cards, the RTX 5070 Ti supports <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dlss-4-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-about-nvidias-latest-ai-upscaling-tech">DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation</a>.  This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution. If you plan on using this card for AI, the RTX 5070 Ti may be a better value since it has the same amount of VRAM as the RTX 5080.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">This deal is part of the Alienware Intel Gamer Days Sale </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Dell is participating in the annual Intel Gamer Days Sale with great discounts on Alienware gaming PCs and laptops featuring Intel Core Ultra processors and Nvidia GeForce Blackwell graphics cards.

This standalone adventure in the Elden Ring universe reimagines the series’ core design with a fresh cooperative twist. The Deluxe Edition packs in extra value with additional playable characters and bosses, a digital artbook, a mini soundtrack, and an exclusive 11x17 key art poster. Designed around three-player co-op, Nightreign has you and your allies pushing back against a world consumed by the creeping night, where shifting environments, formidable threats, and massive bosses make every session feel unique. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review">We gave it 7/10</a>, so it's worth a go for $39.99</p></div><p id="apple-airpods-4-wireless-earbuds"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods 4 Wireless Earbuds">Apple AirPods 4 Wireless Earbuds</h2></p><div catalogid="f34f851f-8897-46fc-b9b1-ff9697c0c887" id="227231"><div id="227231" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods 4 Wireless Earbuds</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has <a href="https://zdcs.link/av4Ew7?object_uuid=a25ee962-a397-441d-95f7-fa6e27fdecc5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apple AirPods 4 (USB-C Charging Case, no Active Noise Cancellation) on sale for $89.99</a> (regularly $129 — 30% off).
