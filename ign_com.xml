            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-made-120-million-in-3-weeks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The free to play Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket is estimated to have surpassed $120 million in sales since it launched on October 30.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-surges-past-100-million-in-17-days/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PocketGamer.biz</a> cited figures from <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppMagic</a> that estimated the digital card game hit $100 million after 17 days and has now crossed the $120.8 million line. Pokémon TCG Pocket is free to play but allows players to buy extra booster packs, cosmetics, and a monthly pass that awards one extra pack a day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The app launched to immediate success, with AppMagic estimating <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">it was making $3 million a day after hitting $12 million after four</a>. But that number has already doubled, with daily player spend now totalling $6.4 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A similar trend was seen per week, as Pokémon TCG Pocket was estimated to have earned $35.8 million in its first week and $48.5 million in its first week. Five days into week three and Pokémon TCG Pocket has pulled in $37.2 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The boost over week one is perhaps due to more players picking up the game but also because, as per mobile game design, Pokémon TCG Pocket frontloads players with packs and cards and cosmetics before reducing those rewards to a trickle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Creatures Inc. is also keeping interest high by releasing myriad events catered to different playstyles. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-adds-new-rewards-and-missions-to-wonder-pick-event">The first offered players freebies in the form of Wonder Picks</a>, and to entertain more than just collectors, Creatures Inc. soon launched battle events both in single player and player versus player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">The Lapras ex Drop Event let players take on a handful of water decks</a> for a chance of winning the beloved Pokémon, while the PvP event embraces Pokémon tradition by putting badges on the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the collecting front, most players are swooning over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-swoon-over-mythical-god-packs-that-have-5-alternate-art-cards">mythical god packs that award five alternate art cards in one go</a>, and there's also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-has-a-secret-mew-card-thats-not-super-difficult-to-get">a secret Mew card hidden in the game</a> that's not super difficult to get.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in battles, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-vote-charizard-ex-best-card-in-the-game">the two usual suspects of Charizard ex and Mewtwo ex are currently dominating the meta</a>, though Pikachu ex isn't far behind.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-player-numbers-are-up-compared-to-last-year-seemingly-due-to-mods<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Baldur's Gate 3's players numbers are up compared to this time last year, seemingly due to official mod support from developer Larian Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian director of publishing Michael Douse shared the improvement on <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1858532995084271848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>, revealing the average daily active users is up 20% over 2023. "Mods are very good," Douse said of the improvement, referencing the release of official mod support as part of Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game, which released in August 2023, is also enjoying an increase of 3% in average daily peak concurrents and a 61% boost in Steam Deck users compared to last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This increase is impressive for a largely single-player game. Baldur's Gate 3 does have cooperative multiplayer but is not a live service that may be expected to enjoy a boost in player numbers year-on-year. And while Larian has continued to update Baldur's Gate 3 with new features and improvements, it has not released DLC for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mods, which are even available on console and not just PC as standard, are proving incredibly popular among Baldur's Gate 3 players. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-download-more-than-50-million-mods-including-10000-that-rename-withers-bone-daddy">P</a><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-download-more-than-50-million-mods-including-10000-that-rename-withers-bone-daddy">layers downloaded more than 50 million mods via the official mod support tool</a> in less than two months, and this number doesn't include the thousands made unofficially.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mods released so far include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-mod-cuts-turn-based-combat-and-makes-everything-real-time">one that adds real-time combat</a> to the otherwise turn-based RPG and another that brought entire new maps to Faerûn, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-modder-reveals-first-custom-maps-including-avernus">including the highly requested Avernus</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 7 otherwise added official content including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/karlach-is-trending-on-xtwitter-after-baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-because-her-new-evil-ending-is-absolutely-metal">an "absolutely metal" ending for Karlach</a> and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-player-finds-scrapped-evil-ending-in-patch-7-thats-hilariously-anticlimactic">hidden evil ending</a>. Players will also be relieved to hear that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-is-not-the-final-update-larian-confirms-but-it-doesnt-want-to-talk-about-whats-coming-just-yet">it's not the final major Baldur's Gate 3 patch after all</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">In our 10/10 review of Baldur's Gate 3</a>, IGN said: "With crunchy, tactical RPG combat, a memorable story with complex characters, highly polished cinematic presentation, and a world that always rewards exploration and creativity, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new high-water mark for CRPGs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
