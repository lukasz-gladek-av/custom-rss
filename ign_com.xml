            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> developer Embark Studios released update 1.4.0 this week, and in the patch notes teased a “very hot fix for the locked room exploits.” It turns out they weren’t kidding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the release of the patch, players — as they often do — jumped into the hugely successful extraction shooter to give this fix a proper test. They’ve been able to cheat their way into locked rooms as before, but what they now find inside… well, Embark called it a “very hot fix” for a reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1p7ytbc/locked_rooms_now_turn_you_into_a_fireball_if_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forward_Problem_7550 discovered</a>, locked rooms now turn you into a fireball if you glitch inside. The clip below shows the trap in action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction to the change is positive, with most players getting a kick out of what Embark has done here. “Best part of this is the clowns doing the glitch lose all their stuff to someone who legitimately opens the door with a key. CLASSIC!” enthused A_Tortured_Crab. “It's genuinely a really good fix,” added vedomedo. “Hopefully this is the mindset they keep going forward. Punish the exploiters and reward legit players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, some players are saying they’re more inclined to use their keys to enter locked rooms legitimately in the hope of finding “some dingus who hasn't read the patch notes.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Technically this isn’t a fix, as players can still use the exploit to enter locked rooms. But it is an eye-catching workaround, and will surely put off players from trying to cheat their way inside a room after they’ve been cooked once.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Would’ve been better if they just didn’t say anything and rolled this out,” suggested Maverixk_. “Imagine all the door glitches finding this out and losing all of their s**t before word of mouth spread. Would’ve been hilarious.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not all the update did. It’s also patched the gun quick swap exploit. Full patch notes are below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arc Raiders Patch Notes 1.4.0:</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">Content and Bug Fixes</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Exploit mitigation mechanisms have been added for all locked rooms across all maps.</li><li>Fixed the gun exploit that allowed you to shoot quicker than intended by swapping to a quick use item and back.</li><li>The exterior access to Spaceport's Control Tower locked room has been blocked off.</li><li>Fixed the issue that sometimes caused low resolution textures in the Main Menu.</li><li>Fixed players being able to push each other by jumping on each other’s backs.</li><li>Fixed lighting artifacts that would sometimes occur upon entering maps.</li><li>Raider Voice now correctly respects the selected voice option after restarting the game.</li></ul><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">What if you exploit the doors now: 😂 <a href="https://t.co/JndqMjMpUn" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/JndqMjMpUn</a> <a href="https://t.co/81aFPE0ucD" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/81aFPE0ucD</a></p>— Scrappy (@TheRooster) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRooster/status/1993997509971292249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.

All cards involved are reprints of existing cards with Monster Hunter themes, nothing mechanically unique or new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say fans reacted negatively to the announcement, and based on <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/back-to-the-drawing-board-with-secret-lair-x-monster-hunter" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wizards of the Coast’s statement on the matter</a>, that backlash went right to the top.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Let's cut to the chase: the Secret Lair x Monster Hunter Superdrop we revealed last week fell short of expectations,” the company said. “We heard loud and clear that you were disappointed, and we believe we can do better. So, we're going to postpone this release and rework this Superdrop entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Like many of you, we're big fans of Monster Hunter. It's why we put this Superdrop together. But in our excitement, we missed the mark on elements like card selection and faithfully integrating the world and mechanics of Monster Hunter. As a result, the overall construction of this Superdrop is not up to the standard you have come to expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Pulling Superdrops back isn't something we're going to do very often, but we're committed to doing better. Capcom is on board for us to take another swing at this Superdrop as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, we're going to pull this one back and will share new details and an updated release date in a few months.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A pristine copy of Fortnite has just been sold for $42,500 — which seems a lot for a free-to-play game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, this is a boxed version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> — something that also grants access to the game's original Save the World mode, which Epic Games still requires you pay a small amount to access. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there's no suggestion this sealed copy of the world's biggest battle royale will ever actually be played. Indeed, it has been sold encased in a box, and labelled with a 10 A++ rating from video game grading company Wata — its highest possible quality score.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/27/screenshot-2025-11-27-160936-1764259864882.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A $42,500 copy of Fortnite. Image credit: Heritage Auctions, HA.com.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sold by <a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/xbox/fortnite-wata-10-a-sealed-storm-master-weapon-pack-xbox-one-gearbox-2017-usa/a/7428-28105.s?ic4=ListView-ShortDescription-071515#auction-info" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heritage Auctions</a>, this copy of Fortnite is an Xbox One version from the game's original 2017 print run. Only a limited number of physical copies were ever produced, and this edition dates back to when the game's now-ubiquitous battle royale mode was just a side-offering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned, it does include access to Save the World, which is worth... something. Epic Games has bundled the original Fortnite mode in numerous ways over the years, but currently sells access as part of a $18.49 add-on that includes 1,500 V-Bucks (which would separately cost $18) as well as an exclusive skin. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with this in mind, though, you're still paying $42,482 over the odds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These days, Fortnite is a very different beast — a metaverse of battle royale modes, user-generated maps, plus LEGO and music offerings. Oh, and it's home to pretty much every media franchise that has ever licensed itself for a video game, as well as real-life popstars and now even Quentin Tarantino.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier today, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-our-first-look-at-quentin-tarantinos-new-lost-chapter-of-kill-bill-starring-an-animated-uma-thurman-and-fortnites-peely-the-banana">Tarantino fans got a first glimpse at the director's new 'Lost Chapter' of Kill Bill</a>, which stars an animated Uma Thurman and Fortnite's Peely the banana, and will debut first within the game. Tell that to someone back in 2017, and I doubt they'd believe you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, video games attracting huge sums as collectible items is nothing new — and within the grand scheme of things, $42,500 pales in comparison to other auction prices. Back in 2021, a factory-sealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-bros-retro-bidding-auction-two-million">copy of Super Mario Bros. sold for a record-breaking $2 million</a>, though there's debate over whether the sale counted as an auction in the traditional sense. Officially, <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/623688-most-expensive-videogame-sold-at-an-online-auction" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guinness World Records</a> recognizes a copy of Super Mario 64 sold for $1.56 million as the highest amount successfully bid for a video game to date. But who knows how much that copy of Fortnite will be worth in another 100 years?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.
