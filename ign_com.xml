            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-cult-classic-rpg-off-gets-surprise-steam-and-switch-release-in-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a piece of news I certainly didn't see coming in the waning hours of 2024, today it was announced that indie cult classic game OFF is getting released on Steam and Nintendo Switch next year in a new and "improved" version, including a physical edition.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar, OFF is an RPG that first released in 2008 from Belgian studio Unproductive Fun Time. It was made in RPG Maker, originally released in French, and has never received an official English translation, though multiple fan translations have sprung up over the years. It's also never been available on typical, popular PC storefronts such as Steam or itch.io, but instead has circulated over the years as a direct download, gaining a cult following due to how utterly weird, unsettling, and at times inscrutable it can be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">OFF puts the player in control of a mysterious baseball player-looking figure known as the Batter, who is instructed by a talking cat calling itself the Judge to travel through four Zones and kill ghostly creatures known as Spectres. The Zones themselves are haunting, upsetting places run by cruel leaders, composed of strange elements such as smoke, metal, plastic, meat, and sugar, and populated by confused and often suffering individuals who seem to be tormented by the Spectres. However, as the game progresses, the player is encouraged to question the actions of the Batter and themselves as a player, with multiple endings possible depending on the player's decisions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite never hitting the mainstream, OFF has served as an inspiration for a number of other hit RPGs, most notably Undertale (and most notably Undertale's absolute creepiest, freakiest stuff). The game is coming to Steam and Nintendo Switch in 2025 both digitally and as a physical edition via Fangamer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<strong>Ainz</strong>: Meta DPS unit, huge range, Fear passive, has a passive with chance to summon enemies when he kills them, has a nuke which deals <strong>150x</strong> his displayed damage.<br>
<strong>Giorno</strong>: Godly Level DPS, only 1 can be placed globally, big range, Slow passive, passive which chips enemies HP by 0.95% per hit and has an ability which sends all enemies to spawn, takes 10% of their HP, and slows all affected enemies down by 90%<br>
<strong>Rudeus</strong>: Terrible DPS, but a support ability to buff all units in range of his same element’s damage<br>
<strong>Makima</strong>: Very good DPS, passive to summon enemies that she killed equal to their original HP, no special status effect, no ability<br>
<strong>Denji</strong>: Meta DPS when girl in range, Best bleed unit in game, no ability"</p><p>With all of these changes, it will be interesting to see how players adapt. Alongside the new Boss Rush mode, these changes could make players have to rethink their team composition. While none of the buffs and nerfs were catastrophic, there are rumblings that the development team behind Anime Last Stand may be working on even more buffs and nerfs to change things even further. I'm intrigued to see what we could expect to see next time around. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Shaun Cichacki is a Freelance Contributor with IGN, covering features, guides, and news.

If you want all the Killzone items you’ll have to hand over Super Credits to the value of nearly twice the cost of a premium Warbond, and nearly half the price of Helldivers 2 itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Helldivers 2 Steam page</a>, Arrowhead said it had talked to Killzone developer Guerrilla Games and is now gifting the items that were meant to be sold as part of the crossover’s second wave next week.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“As this was our first crossover offering, we’ve been listening to the response, and the feedback we’ve received from our community surveys is that crossover content is really high up on your wishlists,” Arrowhead said in its statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At the same time, some of you are not happy with the prices of the items and we will revisit this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Many of you were also concerned that items wouldn’t be in rotation for long enough, and there was a bit of concern around how these items exist outside of our usual Warbond releases, which are always themed in our own universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because of all this, in partnership with our friends at Guerrilla (and as we’re in the season of holiday cheer), we’ve decided to offer a gift to all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Firstly, we are gifting to everyone the planned second wave of the Helldivers x Killzone collaboration items today, free of charge. The distribution of those items will begin shortly, in two waves.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/helldivers-1734623661949.jfif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">New Helldivers 2 x Killzone items are now available for free.

CCO Johan Pilestedt confirmed that the Killzone crossover was initially meant to be released as part of a Warbond, but Arrowhead decided against it in the hopes of avoiding a backlash.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
