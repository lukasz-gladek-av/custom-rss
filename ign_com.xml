Assassin’s Creed Shadows also appeared in now-deleted listings on a U.S. auction site, with one user selling listing multiple copies of the game sold for $100 each, according to <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/assassins-creed-shadows-physical-copies-sold-early-leaks-gameplay-shared-online/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheGamer</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, multiple Twitch streams showing Assassin’s Creed Shadows have appeared, although they are being removed according to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-shadows-is-already-being-leaked-and-streamed-online-a-month-before-release/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a>. Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches officially on March 20, 2025. IGN has asked Ubisoft for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an unfortunate situation for Ubisoft, which has faced a series of difficulties with Assassin’s Creed Shadows since it was announced. Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-insists-assassins-creed-shadows-preorders-are-tracking-solidly-in-line-with-odyssey">Ubisoft insisted that Assassin's Creed Shadows had a strong number of preorders</a> despite its troubled development and promotional period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The struggling publisher said in its latest financial report that "preorders for the game are tracking solidly, in line with those of Assassin's Creed Odyssey, the second most successful entry of the franchise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot maintained this confidence. "Early previews have been positive, praising its narrative and immersive experience, with both characters playing critical roles in the game’s storyline, as well as the quality and complementarity of the gameplay provided by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-players-wont-be-missing-out-if-they-largely-ignore-one-protagonist"><u>the dual protagonist approach</u></a>,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I want to commend the incredible talent and dedication of the entire Assassin’s Creed’s team, who is working tirelessly to ensure that Shadows delivers on the promise of what is the franchise’s most ambitious entry yet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin's Creed Shadows was originally planned for November before Ubisoft bumped it back to February 14. Another delay saw it pushed again to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-this-time-by-another-month"><u>the current release date of March 20</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot rests on the shoulders of Assassin's Creed Shadows as not only the long-awaited Japan-set entry and the first full Assassin's Creed since 2020, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales"><u>a struggling Ubisoft needs it to perform well</u></a> following recent flops and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-investors-grill-ceo-cfo-on-potential-tencent-sale-delays-and-financial-woes"><u>investor frustration</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not enjoyed a particularly positive promotional period so far, however, with the development team having to apologize on separate occasions for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern"><u>inaccuracies in Assassin's Creed Shadows' depictions of Japan</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission"><u>using a historical recreation group's flag without permission</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another controversy came as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design"><u>collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</u></a> over its "insensitive" design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The ending is seen by some as a sort of retirement for Peter Parker, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yuri-lowenthal-on-marvels-spider-man-2-ending-i-dont-think-thats-the-last-were-gonna-see-peter">Lowenthal has repeatedly said Pete has more to offer</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There have been some comments recently that were picked up to infer that Peter’s out and Miles is in,” Lowenthal said in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/yuri-lowenthal-marvels-spider-man-2-ending-johnny-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-1235923489/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Variety</u></a> last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While I think that Peter would love to believe that he can just turn it off and not be Spider-Man anymore and live a completely normal life, I don’t think that’s what’s going to happen now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think 100% he trusts Miles,” Lowenthal continued. “Miles has really stepped up and he’s like, ‘Oh, maybe I can get a little break.’ And I did get a vacation to Symkaria during the Miles game. Not much of a vacation, but at least MJ got to learn to ride a motorcycle, which is awesome.” That motorcycle line is a nod to MJ’s newfound skill with a bike in Spider-Man 2 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/marvels-spider-man-2/Easter_Eggs"><u>and a cool Akira Easter egg</u></a>).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Spider-Man 2: All The Marvel Easter Eggs and References at Coney Island</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In October, Insomniac made the shock announcement that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-insomniacs-spider-man-2-confirmed-to-be-skipping-story-dlc-fans-are-waving-goodbye-and-wondering-whats-next"><u>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</u> wouldn’t get any additional story content</a>, putting to bed fan hopes for DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The announcement came in the same breath that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-pc-officially-announced-with-january-release-date"><u>Sony announced a PC version of Spider-Man 2</u></a>, which launched in January — one of the quickest turnarounds from single-player PS5 exclusive to PC from the company so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Spider-Man 2 came out in September 2023, Insomniac has released a number of updates for the game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-patch-1002000-adds-new-game-mission-replay-new-suits-and-more"><u>adding New Game+, mission replay, new suits, and more</u></a>. But fans had hoped that story DLC would give them more of a reason to return to Insomniac's wonderful recreation of New York than the addition of new features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But fans hadn’t just hoped for Spider-Man 2 story DLC, they had expected it after the game itself left a number of threads that Insomniac might have pulled on for additional content, including the introduction of Carnage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, though, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/insomniac-hackers-release-stolen-data-leak-wolverine-videos-future-projects-and-more"><u>the devastating Insomniac data breach of December 2023</u></a>, which revealed the studio’s upcoming slate of releases, and the accidental release of Spider-Man 2’s development game menu last year, all pointed to planned DLC. Indeed, the development game menu included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-update-appears-to-have-accidentally-revealed-an-upcoming-dlc"><u>what looked like the entire arc of a DLC called the ‘Beetle Villain Arc.’</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the turbulence caused by the Insomniac data breach, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-significant-playstation-layoffs-affecting-900-staff-london-studio-to-close"><u>Sony made a significant round of layoffs affecting around 900 staff</u></a>, or about 8% of its global PlayStation workforce. Insomniac was one of a number of PlayStation studios hit by the cuts.
