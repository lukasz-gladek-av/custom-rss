Chief among them is the ability to, for the first time, mix leaders with civs they have nothing to do with, going by real-world history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In previous Civ games, the civilizations themselves are tied to a specific leader, usually a famous head of state, in such a way as to make historical sense. Elizabeth I, for example, leads the English. Gandhi leads the Indians, and so on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Civilization 7, however, lets players mix and match history for some crazy combinations, and while some players have said they are enjoying the gameplay possibilities this system unlocks, others have bemoaned what they consider to be an assault on historical accuracy — a quality the Civilization franchise is known for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A full campaign in Civilization 7 is one that goes through all three Ages: Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern. Once the Age is completed, all players (and any AI opponents) experience an Age Transition simultaneously. During an Age Transition, three things happen: you select a new civilization from the new Age to represent your empire, you choose which Legacies you want to retain in the new Age, and the game world evolves. The Civilization games have never had such a system.</p><div id="best-civ-7-leaders" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Civ 7 Leaders</h3><h3>Best Civ 7 Leaders</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN, Civilization 7 lead designer Ed Beach explained Firaxis’ thinking here, and defended the gameplay changes as they relate to historical accuracy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think what we actually did is moved it around to a different place,” Beach said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So if you look at previous Civ games, you would have historical anomalies such as America existing in 4,000 BC or Sweden and Canada in 4,000 BC. And none of those things actually made any sense. They were just accepted parts of the Civ canon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But now if you're going to get to America, you're going to start somewhere else. You're going to start with Rome and go to the Normans and then go to America. I just did a Harriet Tubman playthrough where I was trying to honor her African heritage, and so I played as Aksum and then as the Songhai and then came over to America. So these are all valid pathways through history. You can set them up so that the leaders make good sense with this one, and arguably the history is more solid this way than it was before.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beach acknowledged, however, that Civilization 7 opens up the possibility for players to create combinations “that seem like we’re breaking history even more than before,” but insisted its fresh take on video game history “is a healthy one.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are ways you can take the game that we're putting together with Civ 7 and mix up the history in an even more scrambled fashion than you ever had before,” Beach said. “So you can take Confucius and you can have him lead Spain, or you can take Xerxes from Persia and have him lead the Mayan civilization.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So absolutely, there are crazy combinations that seem like we're breaking history even more than before, but there are some problems that we fixed. So I'd like to look at as we've moved it around. It's a new way for players to experience and think about history, and I think that kind of fresh take is a healthy one.”</p><div id="best-civ-7-antiquity-civs" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Civ 7 Antiquity Civs</h3><h3>Best Civ 7 Antiquity Civs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Generally speaking, Civilization 7’s changes have divided the franchise’s fanbase, although the game’s ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam has more to do with launch deficiencies Firaxis is working to address. Beach told IGN he never set out to deliberately cause a furore within the Civilization community, but insisted the changes came from a desire to have more players actually finish a game of Civilization 7 compared to previous titles in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Anyone who knows me, that's really not sort of in my personality or DNA to purposely try to shake people up,” Beach said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are people that do that for sure, but that's not where I usually come from. We really just wanted to, I think, accomplish two things. One, we needed to really think about the Civ formula and what was working and what wasn't working. And it's not just the Civ formula, it's the 4X strategy formula in general. There is this exponential explosion of objects in the world and decisions forced on the players. And in most 4X games that just sort of continues linearly from the beginning of the game, exploding outward in all directions. But it's really hard to finish a 4X strategy game because the end of the game is so tedious to get through usually that it's just a problem. So it was really that was the number one thing that we were trying to address.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now, I'd say the second point is that every time we do a new version of Civilization, it's not okay for us to take the exact same gameplay that we had before, put a fresh coat of paint on it, sharpen up the units models and the way the game world looks and say, Hey, we're done. We really want each version of Civilization to have sort of a signature element that people associate with it. And so if breaking the game up into big chapters where each chapter has a climactic finish to it and then you take a breath and reset and go into the next stage, if we felt like that was going to be an improvement to the whole 4X strategy formula, we wanted to do that. And it also gives a signature element for Civ 7.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Executive producer Dennis Shirk chimed in to say Firaxis didn’t want to take the Madden team approach putting out an “iterative release” with Civilization 7. “We've got a highly polished Civilization 6 planted there right now,” Shirk said. “We've got a ton of players playing it. Ed and his team… every time they do a version of the game, everything is put on the table. We put everything into it as a team to make a new experience. It's not something where we strategize over the next few iterations the kind of things that we want to do from version to version. It just gets all on the table.”</p><div id="best-civ-7-exploration-civs" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Civ 7 Exploration Civs</h3><h3>Best Civ 7 Exploration Civs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps in the shorter term, Firaxis will be working to address Civ 7’s ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam, which stems from various community complaints around the user interface, a lack of map variety, and a feeling that the game has launched without a number of key features fans have come to expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN ahead of the release of its third quarter financial results, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-legacy-civilization-audience-will-eventually-come-around-on-civilization-7-amid-mixed-steam-user-reviews"><u>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick acknowledged that Civilization 7 had received some negative reviews from press and players</u></a>, but insisted that the “legacy Civ audience” will come around the more they play, and called Civilization 7’s early performance “very encouraging.” Oh, and if you’re wondering, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-dev-firaxis-says-theres-hope-for-gandhi-yet">there’s hope for Gandhi yet</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for tips to help you take over the world?

Work is currently ongoing to improve the stability of the Network Test. An additional Network Test session is being considered."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second session is set for later today, February 14, 7pm-10pm PT / 10pm-1am ET.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ORIGINAL STORY:</strong> Elden Ring Nightreign’s first network test — ongoing at the time of this article’s publication — is suffering from significant server issues that have prevented many from playing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN staff with access to the test reported server problems so extreme they were unable to access the game for the test’s first hour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The issues were bad enough that <a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_sp/status/1890361803944718443" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FromSoftware issued a statement on social media</a>, confirming that players were struggling to find a match due to server congestion. The developer apologized, but encouraged players to try matching again after a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It appears the PlayStation servers in particular are having problems, and indeed were brought down for maintenance. "The #NIGHTREIGN PlayStation servers are currently under maintenance," FromSoftware <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1890375493611851834" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. "Work is ongoing to restore server functionality. Further updates will be provided. Thank you for your patience and understanding."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exacerbating the problem is the fact the Elden Ring Nightreign network test is only available during five three-hour periods on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S from February 14 to February 17. Here’s the current schedule:</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign network test session timings:</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>February 14: 3am-6am PT / 6am-9am ET</li><li>February 14: 7pm-10pm PT / 10pm-1am ET</li><li>February 15: 11am-2pm PT / 2pm-5pm ET</li><li>February 16: 3am-6am PT / 6am-9am ET</li><li>February 16: 7pm-10pm PT / 10pm-1am ET</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The network test is a “preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch,” Bandai Namco said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This large-scale Network Stress Test is designed to evaluate various aspects of the online system's functionality and performance. We are looking forward to your cooperation to make Elden Ring Nightreign even better."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is of course better that Elden Ring Nightreign suffers server issues now than when it launches in May, but players who had earmarked time to try out the game now have expressed their frustration. Hopefully subsequent play sessions will run more smoothly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign is FromSoftware’s standalone co-operative spin-off set in a world parallel to that of 2022’s Elden Ring. The network test will allow three players to team up and take their chosen Nightfarers to battle "against new terrors, and explore an ever-changing map to defeat increasingly challenging bosses and ultimately take on the Nightlord," Bandai Namco added, before confirming the network test features a three day-and-night cycle squads must try to outlast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year IGN had the opportunity to visit FromSoftware and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-we-played-it"><u>go hands-on with an early build of Elden Ring Nightreign</u></a>.
