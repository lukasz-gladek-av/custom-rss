            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-sweeney-says-fortnites-biggest-challenge-is-convincing-people-its-the-everything-game-and-not-just-a-battle-royale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has discussed the future of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, and the developer's continued desire to grow the game from something known primarily as a battle royale into a platform that offers experiences of numerous different genres.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Several years after Fortnite's much-promoted Big Bang event that launched Lego Fortnite, Rock Band developer Harmonix's Festival and Rocket League maker Psyonix's Rocket Racing, Sweeney told IGN at Unreal Fest 2025 that Epic Games' key issue remained the fact that people still think of Fortnite simply as its leading battle royale portion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's our central challenge, to have everybody recognize that Fortnite is the everything game and you can experience anything there," Sweeney said, "and that's going to take time. We're going to have to deliver on a lot of other really awesome genres."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Progress towards that goal has, so far, been steady. Festival continues to attract big name music acts to headline its seasons with new player skins and music drops. Lego Fortnite Odyssey, a survival crafting experience, has a solid player core. But Rocket Racing has largely been retired, and newer shooter-centric modes such as Reload have found more success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During its State of Unreal show this week, Epic Games noted that a third-party experience in Fortnite had momentarily overtaken Epic's own core modes for the first time, something that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago. But Epic Games' own non-shooter modes currently show no signs of replicating this success, with player numbers well below that of the developer's main Battle Royale and Zero Build playlists, let alone Reload or the game's Fortnite OG throwback offering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked by IGN whether engagement for modes such as the musical Fortnite Festival and various Lego Fortnite experiences were where Epic Games wanted them to be, Epic Games executive vice president Sax Persson replied: "I don't think we're ever happy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think the shooter modes have done well," Sweeney added. "I think we've not yet achieved the magic that we've been hoping to achieve with the music gameplay. It's funny, we brought in the Harmonix team, [they] joined Epic, built Rock Band and Guitar Hero in the past, they're an awesome team, and they've been riffing on approaches to that genre and Fortnite. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They've also been bringing in all kinds of music items into Fortnite with Jam Tracks, which have not only a song, but all the beats associated with them, and ability to play them on your instruments."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Music has done extraordinarily well in Fortnite, but ironically, not so much in music games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, despite Fortnite's hugely-popular musical live events generating massive interest and player numbers in the millions, Epic has not yet found a formula that generates regular engagement of the same kind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Music has done extraordinarily well in Fortnite, but ironically, not so much in music games," Sweeney noted, "more just in Battle Royale and elsewhere. Our next step is to figure out music at a large scale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think as Rock Band and Guitar Hero themselves achieved in their day, which was a decade or two decades ago, there's an opportunity for a music game with tens of millions of monthly active users that people just absolutely love and come to every evening or weekend for the coolest concert and competitive gameplay of all sorts."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How about Lego, then, the brand that's perhaps now the most deeply entrenched within the Fortnite ecosystem, and the offering that's most popular of all Epic's non-shooter modes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think Lego is interesting, Persson said. "We are super proud of [the] journey and it has a really dedicated fan base. But is it as big as we would want it to be? No, we would love to have it bigger and figure out a way to get more Lego fans to see that this exists."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fortnite Revealed for Nintendo Switch 2 - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, it sounds like Epic is still facing the issue that Fortnite currently remains a brand associated with being a battle royale more than anything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What's our primary challenge? Our primary challenge is Fortnite is Fortnite, and historically Fortnite was a shooter game," Persson continued. "It is not a shooter game anymore. It is the everything game, and we need to tell that story better than what we've done."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One solution to this will be the forthcoming rollout of improved capabilities for third-party teams working within Fortnite's Unreal Engine-powered editor, UEFN, Sweeney said. Epic currently has a better toolset than other creators, but this will change over time — to the point that Epic's own battle royale seasons will eventually (now in 2026) be made with the same tools as any creator could have access to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we develop our modes, we're working with C++ and the entire Unreal Engine, [while] creators working with the toolset that we built, it's Verse and some APIs," Sweeney noted. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our big task now is to get the two of those development frameworks to converge so that we, Epic, and creators are working in the exact same tools with the exact same capabilities and creators will have way more power at their disposal there, and that's been the thing that we've been working so hard on for the last two years."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I would say we're only successful with Fortnite as an ecosystem"</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But why not just settle with being a brilliantly successful battle royale? For Epic Games, the future of Fortnite as a continued experience — and source of enormous income for the company — rests on its continued evolution and ongoing cultural relevance, amid the ever-changing landscape of popular video game tastes and genres.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I would say we're only successful with Fortnite as an ecosystem," Sweeney concluded. "If somebody else actually beats us at our game, and builds something that's bigger and cooler and better than battle royale... I think there's a high probability of that happening. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you look at the shooter genre, it evolved with new game types coming out over time based on what was possible with the current technology," he added, noting the evolution of shooters from simple games of Deathmatch to modes with larger player counts and vehicles. "Battle Royale just happens to be the best shooter genre yet invented — and thanks to both the Japanese movie makers and [PUBG creator] Brendan Green for discovering the magic there. But it's definitely not the last. There'll be more and it'll get even better and new technologies are going to make things that are currently impossible, possible, and I think that's going to unleash unexpected surprises and creativity."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a busy week for Epic Games, which has been talking about the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ai-prompts-will-soon-let-a-10-person-team-build-a-game-like-breath-of-the-wild-where-the-ai-is-doing-all-the-dialogue-and-you-just-write-character-synopsis-tim-sweeney-predicts">future of AI in its Unreal Engine and in Fortnite</a> following the recent release of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-has-only-been-live-for-an-hour-and-already-epic-has-patched-out-him-saying-fk">very chatty AI-powered Darth Vader</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/james-bond-fans-think-theyve-worked-out-secret-identity-of-007-first-light-actor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of secret agent James Bond haven't taken long to decide who they think is the (not so) mysterious actor playing the role in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's new trailer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-reveals-new-young-james-bond-with-the-walking-deads-lennie-james-set-to-co-star">revealed at Sony's State of Play broadcast</a>, shows off a notably younger-looking Bond, fresh out of the Royal Navy and keen to earn his 00 agent status. But who is playing the title role?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Minutes after the trailer aired, fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1l3icpc/i_think_the_actor_for_the_james_bond_game_is/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> began guessing that Dexter: New Blood star Patrick Gibson was the behind the new Bond — and he certainly shares a strong similarity with the character in the trailer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I clocked it THE SECOND I saw the dirty smirk of his," wrote one 007 aficionado. "Yeah I peeped that as soon as I seen it," said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Watching the trailer and knew the face looked familiar," said a third. "After about a minute or so I screamed 'DEXTER.' I'm pretty sure it's him."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aged 30, the Irish actor is just a few years older than the 26-year-old version of Bond he looks set to portray in the upcoming game — and, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy">if IO Interactive gets its way, several sequels</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if Gibson looks familiar to you too, well, the actor already has a swathe of TV and film roles under his belt, including appearances in Shadow and Bone, The Tudors, and The OA. But it's his role as a younger version of Dexter Morgan in prequel series Dexter: Original Sin for which he's most famous.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/05/gettyimages-632417032-1749114309513.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Patrick Gibson. Photo by Francois G. Durand/WireImage.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, 007 First Light developer IO Interactive is yet to confirm Gibson itself — though IGN has asked the studio if it can comment on the internet's speculation. Gibson also, for now, appears to keeping schtum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A press release issued alongside Gibson's apparent debut in 007 First Light's trailer describes the game as as globe-trotting story-driven action-adventure game where you can choose how to navigate various challenges — either with brute force or 007's trademark charm. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer showed Bond cracking a couple of deadpan jokes as he got himself out of (and into) trouble. Gibson's acting chops as the antihero Dexter look set to be put to good use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">007 First Light is due to launch at some point in 2026 for Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. In case you missed it, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Sony's State of Play June 2025 showcase</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Francois G.

Back in the day, this would’ve been right around the time when staff members started bringing in sleeping bags to stay overnight in the studio, but nowadays we make sure that everyone gets enough time to rest and refresh properly," Suda51 explained.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I’ll never forget the craziness of working all night in a frenzy back in our salad days, receiving warning mails for doing too much overtime (this actually happened). The final stage of game development is really similar to the world of the movie Beautiful Dreamer, like the night just before a big school festival. Man, it’s been awhile – now I want to watch Beautiful Dreamer again. What, you don’t know that movie...? I guess maybe a lot of you are a bit too young to remember it... It’s probably streaming somewhere, so check it out sometime."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Romeo Is a Dead Man is an "ultra-violent science fiction" action game coming from the collective minds of Suda51's Grasshopper Manufacture. Romeo Stargazer — which is one of the best protagonist names I've ever seen, by the way — is an FBI Space-Time special agent searching the universe for the most-wanted fugitives. It's slated for PC via Steam and Microsoft, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S, but isn't expected to release until 2026. As for why Grasshopper has given such a vague release window? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That’s kinda obvious, isn’t it?" Suda51 said, hinting at what can only be in reference to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>GTA 6</u></a>. "That One Game had its release date announced, right? Every publisher wants to make sure to steer clear of That One Game’s release date. But what if we were to flex a little and release it on the same day... Yeah, nope — just thinking about that is way too scary. Alright then, see you later."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony kicked off the summer reveal season with a bang, presenting a smorgasbord of new games to whet our appetites going into Summer Games Fest Week. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced"><u>Here's everything announced at PlayStation State of Play 2025</u></a> last night, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced"><u>007 First Light</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls"><u>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles"><u>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f"><u>Silent Hill f'</u></a>s release date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Both are on Steam Beta first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This first update focuses on quests, major bugs and blockers, and quality of life fixes. The second update will focus on performance. Bethesda said it will share more details “when we are able.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A performance patch is much needed. Oblivion Remastered has enjoyed a hugely successful launch, with over 4 million players and a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam. However, if there’s one issue that continues to crop up, it’s performance problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-revisited-profound-problems-have-yet-to-be-addressed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a> found Oblivion Remastered on consoles to have significant problems across the board. DF’s Thomas Morgan said of Virtuos’ Unreal Engine 5 overhaul:</p><blockquote>No platform is spared of issues: whether it's PS5, PS5 Pro, or either Xbox Series machine, all struggle with traversal hitches while roaming the open world. Secondly, there's major sub-60fps frame-rates, where I've also discovered that performance slowly degrades with more playing time — quite possibly down to a memory leak. And finally, software freezes are the icing on the cake, with all PlayStation and Xbox platforms crashing to the system menu on loading a save one too many times.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">How does this manifest itself in-game? According to DF, a “charged” playthrough with more continuous play time behind it performs worse than a fresh boot. Cycling through saves also introduces bugs in the charged play through, Morgan revealed. And this is particularly curious: this also leads to the camera position being too high while riding horseback. You can fix this by resetting the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a dire position for any remaster to be in and developer Virtuos needs to address the game's stability - the crashes - as a priority,” Morgan continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a damning assessment of Oblivion on console, but what about PC? DF called PC performance “dire.” It’s worth checking out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-is-one-of-the-worst-performing-pc-games-weve-ever-tested" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DF’s analysis in full</u></a> for more.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Update 1.1., highlights include ToggleHudVisibility and ShowHud console commands, which will be perfect for those looking to capture Oblivion Remastered screenshots (it’s a gorgeous game!), a fix for not automatically showing the Local Map when inside interior spaces and a fix for the Local Map being blank when opening, and a fix for the first-person camera being set above the player's head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology.
