He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Sep 18, 2025 5:00 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-spider-man-prerelease-is-this-week-heres-all-you-need-to-know]]></content:encoded>
