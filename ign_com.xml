Are you an old-school planeswalker, a returning player curious about what you’ve missed, or a newcomer ready to shuffle up? From gothic horror to space exploration, this year’s lineup promises wild themes, iconic characters, and game-changing mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s your set-by-set guide to what’s dropping in 2025, including the highlights and reasons you might want to crack some packs. We're talking remasters, new licenses from Final Fantasy VII, Marvel's Spider-Man and much more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy Preorders (Releases June 13)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The crossover you didn't know you needed, Magic teams up with Final Fantasy for a Universes Beyond set that spans all sixteen mainline games. Iconic characters like Cloud, Sephiroth, and Noctis step onto the battlefield, bringing new Summon Spells, legendary creatures, and equipment that pay homage to the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From Chocobos to Materia, the mechanics reflect Final Fantasy's charm and complexity. The set introduces innovative gameplay elements inspired by Final Fantasy's RPG roots while ensuring the cards feel at home in Magic. And yes, it's Standard-legal, so you can toss these cards into your decks without worrying about restrictions.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering 2025 Release Schedule</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst preorders aren't live for these sets just yet, we've got it on good authority from Wizards of the Coast that they're coming. Here's each upcoming MTG set in date order alongside what players can expect from the set:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tarkir: Dragonstorm: April 11, 2025</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">We're returning to Tarkir; it's all about dragons this time. Massive magical storms are waking up ancient dragons, and the clans of Tarkir are fighting for dominance amidst the chaos. Legendary dragons like Ugin's Spiritstorm and Atarka, World-Eater, make a fiery comeback alongside new clan leaders and mechanics tailored to their strategies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Muscle-specific abilities are joined by returning mechanics like Morph and Dash, offering fresh ways to build around your favorite factions. And if you're a collector, the Ghostflame Treatment on select cards gives this set a mystical vibe.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Edge of Eternities: August 1, 2025</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Space fantasy hits Magic with Edge of Eternities. Set in the Sothera system, this expansion introduces alien species, futuristic tech, and celestial powers that push Magic into uncharted territory. Planets with unique mechanics and interstellar drama offer a fresh take on the multiverse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New mechanics draw from space exploration themes, and Spaceship Artifacts play a central role. Cosmic spells inspired by black holes and supernovas bring an epic scale to gameplay. At the same time, legendary creatures reflect the diversity of the galaxy.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel's Spider-Man: Late 2025</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Spider-Verse swings into Magic with another Universes Beyond expansion, bringing Peter Parker, Miles Morales, and their rogues' gallery to the game. Legendary creatures like Green Goblin and equipment cards representing iconic gadgets like Web-Shooters give players a taste of superhero action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mechanics inspired by Spider-Man's agility and heroism promise fresh gameplay twists. Plus, narrative-driven Enchantment Sagas lets players relive iconic moments from Spidey's history. It's a must-have for fans of Magic and Marvel alike.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Released Sets of 2025</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Innistrad Remastered: January 24, 2025</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're into creepy castles, werewolves under a blood-red moon, and graveyard shenanigans, Innistrad Remastered is the throwback you didn't know you needed. This set pulls together the best bits of Magic's gothic horror plane, combining fan-favorite cards like Liliana of the Veil and Snapcaster Mage with the chilling ambiance of the original Innistrad. It's perfect for nostalgic drafting or just building your ultimate spooky deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mechanics like Transform, Flashback, and Morbid return to haunt your games. Double-faced cards add an extra layer of strategy—who doesn't love flipping a harmless villager into a ravenous werewolf? And with rebalanced draft archetypes, you can relive (or discover) the joy of Innistrad's eerie gameplay without digging through your old binders.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Aetherdrift: February 14, 2025</h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aetherdrift cranks the action up to 11 with a multiversal race across planes like Kaladesh and Amonkhet. Imagine Mad Max meets Magic as players build around Legendary Vehicles and new Race Mechanics, making every turn feel like you're gunning for the finish line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Returning mechanics like Crew and Exert mix seamlessly with new high-octane abilities, keeping games fast and unpredictable. Highlights include souped-up vehicles that play as legendary creatures and spells that simulate the chaos of a multiversal race. Whether you're here for the mechanics or the chaos, Aetherdrift will surely deliver thrills.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Released Sets of 2024: A Mini Review</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Jump to:</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="#bloom" data-cy="styled-link">Bloomburrow</a></li><li><a href="#mp" data-cy="styled-link">Monty Python</a></li><li><a href="#6" data-cy="styled-link">Assassin's Creed</a></li><li><a href="#5" data-cy="styled-link">Modern Horizons 3</a></li><li><a href="#4" data-cy="styled-link">Outlaws of Thunder Junction</a></li><li><a href="#3" data-cy="styled-link">Fallout</a></li><li><a href="#2" data-cy="styled-link">Murders at Karlov Manor</a></li><li><a href="#1" data-cy="styled-link">Ravnica Remastered

Times are tough all over - Let's find these incredible people new jobs, because we all need to eat, right? :D”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video game development community reacted with a mix of shock and anger to the cuts, given Marvel Rivals’ explosive success. The free-to-play hero shooter has seen over 20 million downloads since launch in December, and huge peak concurrent player numbers on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Sasser’s LinkedIn profile, his team focused on game and level design work for Marvel Rivals, “offering guidance, strategy, and design direction over the last couple of years.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase issued IGN a statement confirming the layoffs, but failed to specify how many people were cut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We recently made the difficult decision to adjust Marvel Rivals’ development team structure for organizational reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game," NetEase said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This resulted in a reduction of a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of Marvel Rivals. We appreciate the hard work and dedication of those affected and will be treating them confidentially and respectfully with recognition for their individual contributions.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But NetEase was keen to stress that the layoffs won’t impact ongoing support for Marvel Rivals, whose primary development team is based in China.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to reassure our fanbase that the core development team for Marvel Rivals, which continues to be led by Lead Producer Weicong Wu and Game Creative Director Guangyun Chen in Guangzhou, China, remains fully committed to delivering an exceptional experience,” NetEase continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game. We’re excited to deliver new super hero characters, maps, features, and content to ensure an engaging live service experience for our worldwide player base.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the latest round of layoffs at NetEase, which has pulled back from a number of overseas investments and closed studios in the U.S. and Japan, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/visions-of-mana-dev-reportedly-being-shut-down-by-netease">Visions of Mana developer Ouka Studios</a>. In November, Worlds Untold, headed by Mass Effect alumni Mac Walters, announced a pause of operations after a split with publisher NetEase. And in January it cut Jar of Sparks, founded by Halo and Destiny 2 veteran Jerry Hook in 2022.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
