It was a move decided by a three-judge panel that brought an end to the FTC’s questioning of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-verdict-has-been-reached-in-the-microsoft-vs-ftc-trial?_cache=pass"><u>July 2023 decision</u></a> to allow Microsoft to finalize its purchase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard has faced scrutiny from across the board for more than three years. Select U.S. Senators were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bernie-sanders-and-senators-raise-concerns-about-activision-blizzard-deal-xbox"><u>among the first to oppose the transaction</u></a>, bringing up concerns of the ongoing consolidation of the tech industry as the Xbox maker brought in more major companies under its wing. As competitors and gamers alike grew concerned an acquisition meant popular franchises like Call of Duty would no longer launch on competing platforms, Microsoft confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-biggest-psn-launch-ever-phil-spencer"><u>it had no interest in barring certain franchises behind lengthy exclusivity periods</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While challenges continued to arise throughout 2023, Microsoft was finally able to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-69-billion-activision-blizzard-buyout-imminent-after-stock-halted-and-uk-clears-deal"><u>complete its purchase of Activision Blizzard</u></a> in October of that same year. The FTC’s appeal could have presented a late roadblock to continuing operations as normal, and now that its efforts have failed, it seems its pursuit is finally over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a full timeline of all of Microsoft’s struggles with finalizing its Activision Blizzard acquisition, you can click <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-a-complete-timeline-of-events"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

Its goal is to organize the most accurate GTA 6 map possible, work that was, up until the release of Trailer 2, based on the leaks and December 2023’s Trailer 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest version of the GTA 6 map, released at the end of March by project lead DuPz0r, is now outdated, with the flood of information Trailer 2 provides helping to create a much more accurate and detailed effort.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">GTA VI Mapping Project v0.049<a href="https://t.co/gv4pgMkJcS" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/gv4pgMkJcS</a> <a href="https://t.co/ItsNdPafjA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ItsNdPafjA</a></p>— DuPz0r (@DuPz0r) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuPz0r/status/1906419827285110970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">As well as confirming plot details, characters, and releasing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-70-brand-new-screenshots-reveal-the-characters-and-places-of-leonida">70 brand new GTA 6 screenshots</a>, Rockstar revealed information and images of the explorable places in the state of Leonida, GTA 6's take on Florida.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Locations confirmed as part of this week’s reveal include Vice City, GTA 6’s version of Miami, tropical archipelago Leonida Keys, Grassrivers, Port Gellhorn, Ambrosia, and Mount Kalaga, a national landmark up against the state’s northern border.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the volunteers will also be scouring the trailer itself for details on the exact location of everything we see, and trying to match up images of fictional spaces to their real-life counterparts as they lock-in more of GTA 6’s map. Once the work is done, DuPz0r will release an updated map, which fans hope will give them their best look yet at what to expect from GTA 6 when it eventually comes out in May 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, if before then, Rockstar releases more GTA 6 assets, when fans get their first proper look at gameplay perhaps, the volunteers will go again. Only when GTA 6 is released and they can compare the fan map to the real thing will they find out just how accurate their work has been.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Leonida Keys Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, hanging over the GTA 6 mapping project is the potential for Rockstar parent company Take-Two to shut the whole thing down. In March, the modder who released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-grand-theft-auto-superfan-is-recreating-the-gta-6-map-in-gta-5-and-yes-theyre-always-worried-about-a-take-two-takedown">a playable recreation of the GTA 6 map in GTA 5</a> ceased all work on the project <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-map-in-gta-5-mod-suffers-inevitable-take-two-takedown-creator-believes-it-was-probably-a-little-too-accurate-and-could-have-ruined-the-surprise">after being hit by a Take–Two takedown</a>. The mod itself was based on the GTA 6 mapping project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, I asked Garza if he was worried about potential action from Take-Two, and he admitted to "some mild concern."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This project has been going on for quite some time with no direct disruption to our community," Garza continued. "However, I always keep it into consideration if they intend on communicating with us in the future for any reason. We do not explicitly showcase leaked material in the map, so I do not believe they would take that down in particular. I believe they are aware that this project gathers popularity and interest in the game, since everyone wants to see how the world may look like. This can be one of the reasons why they haven’t done anything, since it’s not too negative. If I were ever in the situation of receiving a cease and desist though, then I would respectfully cease and desist. As we get closer to a precise map, it may be possible to receive that notice in the future."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out, we’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2"><u>all the details we’ve discovered so far</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-gta-6-trailer-2-out-in-the-wild-the-fan-theories-are-coming-thick-and-fast-and-some-sound-pretty-plausible"><u>all the GTA 6 fan theories emerging from Trailer 2 itself</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-massive-profits-are-too-big-for-a-studio-with-our-size-to-handle"><u>couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated</u></a>. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>signing a deal with Sony</u></a> to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP. It later launched the game on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Palworld’s huge launch, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company went down the patent route. They want 5 million yen (approx $32,846) each plus late payment damages, as well as an injunction against Palworld that would block its release.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In November, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-reveals-patents-at-the-heart-of-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-lawsuit-and-how-much-money-its-being-sued-for"><u>Pocketpair confirmed the three Japan-based patents</u></a>, which revolve around catching Pokémon in a virtual field, it is being sued over. Palworld <em>does</em> include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, similar to the mechanic seen in the 2022 Nintendo Switch exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus"><u>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Half a year later, Pocketpair has now provided an update admitting recent changes made to the game were indeed the result of the legal threats. Pocketpair confirmed that Patch v0.3.11, released in November 2024, was the result of the ongoing litigation - as players suspected. This patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pal Spheres and instead changed it to a static summon next to the player. Several other game mechanics were also changed with this patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair said that if it hadn’t made these changes to Palworld, “the alternative would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience for players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it doesn’t stop there. Pockeptpair said that today's Patch v0.5.5 makes further changes to Palworld so that gliding will be performed using a glider rather than with Pals. Pals in the player's team will still provide passive buffs to gliding, but players will now need to have a glider in their inventory in order to glide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair called these changes “compromises” the studio is being forced to make out of fear of an injunction being granted that could block the development and sale of Palworld.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We understand that this will be disappointing for many, just as it is for us, but we hope our fans understand that these changes are necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of Palworld,” Pocketpair said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite making these changes, Pocketpair said it will continue to dispute the claims made in the lawsuit, focusing on asserting the “invalidity” of the patents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's Pocketpair's statement in full:</p><blockquote>We would like to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation for the continued support of our fans over the past few months. We apologize for not being able to share as much information as we would like, but we trust our fans understand how difficult it is to be fully transparent while litigation is ongoing.</blockquote><blockquote>Currently, we remain involved in prolonged legal proceedings regarding alleged patent infringement. We continue to dispute these claims and assert the invalidity of the patents in question. However, we have had to make certain compromises in order to avoid disruptions to the development and distribution of Palworld.</blockquote><blockquote>On November 30th, 2024, we released Patch v0.3.11 for Palworld. This patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pal Spheres and instead changed it to a static summon next to the player. Several other game mechanics were also changed with this patch. As many have speculated, these changes were indeed a result of the ongoing litigation. Everyone here at Pocketpair was disappointed that this adjustment had to be made, and we fully understand that many players feel the same frustration. Unfortunately, as the alternative would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience for players, it was determined that this change was necessary.</blockquote><blockquote>Furthermore, we regret to inform our players that with the implementation of Patch v0.5.5, we must make yet another compromise. From this patch onward, gliding will be performed using a glider rather than with Pals. Pals in the player's team will still provide passive buffs to gliding, but players will now need to have a glider in their inventory in order to glide.</blockquote><blockquote>We understand that this will be disappointing for many, just as it is for us, but we hope our fans understand that these changes are necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of Palworld.</blockquote><blockquote>We also want to extend our apologies to our fans for the discomfort and concern this ongoing litigation has caused.</blockquote><blockquote>We remain committed to developing Palworld and delivering exciting new content to our fans.<br>On behalf of everyone at Pocketpair and Team Palworld, thank you again for your continued support.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">At the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood">IGN sat down for an extended conversation with John “Bucky” Buckley, communications director and publishing manager for Palworld developer Pocketpair</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals (a claim that the person who originally made it has since retracted). He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> a bit on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” to the studio and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
