It’s a shorter list that positions the new update as one of the smaller in recent memory, but that doesn’t mean it won’t keep players locked in for the time being.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rivals fans often show up for the FPS gameplay and stick around for the guns, so the Gunblade already feels right at home. This two-in-one rifle doubles as both a ranged weapon and a giant blade. Using both to catch your opponents off guard may prove useful in the heat of battle, especially on the new Rivals Bridge map. This suspended, concrete location leaves no room for small talk by putting players into close-quarters combat from the jump with only a few concrete walls and a bus standing in between them. Nosniy says the arena is located in Seoul and comes from creator @GreatGuyBoom.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/22/roblox-rivals-update-9-1737584645781.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Rivals Update 9 adds the Gunblade to the Roblox FPS experience's arsenal.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, fans will notice that the Rivals Update 9 patch notes don’t mention any specific bug fixes, balance changes, or quality-of-life additions. The developers acknowledge their decision to ditch any other tweaks in favor of adding the Bridge map and Gunblade. Although there was room to “slightly” modify the skins for the Demon Shorty and Demon Uzi while renaming a few other weapons, Nosniy does promise more to come with the next major content update. Among the new additions will be one long-awaited feature: Ranked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We hear all of your feedback and want to reassure you all that every necessary &amp; additional changes/improvements will be made in time for Ranked,” the team said in a statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rivals fans have enjoyed regular updates since launch arrived last May. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rivals-update-7-patch-notes-outline-plans-for-weekly-weapon-drops"><u>Update 7</u></a>, for example, brought along the introduction of the Energy Rifle, Energy Pistols, Crossbow, and more.

It was a surprise reveal that came alongside confirmation that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-at-microsofts-xbox-developer-direct-2025">Microsoft is set to publish Ninja Gaiden 4</a> across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S (including Game Pass day one) later in 2025. For more, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-2025-everything-announced">everything announced during Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb on Ninja Gaiden 2 Black:</p><blockquote>In Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, players assume the role of Ryu Hayabusa, a deadly ninja who wields the legendary Dragon Sword while embarking on a global battle against a series of formidable foes. The beautiful and bloody remaster utilizes Unreal Engine 5 to significantly enhance the graphic expression, elevating everything from character visuals to environmental backgrounds. In fact, the stages, characters, effects, and lighting have all been completely redesigned and remastered to fully immerse gamers into the story’s dark ninja world.</blockquote><blockquote>Gore elements such as dismemberment and blood have also been remastered to enhance the action experience. The high-speed, violent fights play out in brilliant brutality, utilizing a variety of weapons and techniques including Japanese swords, shurikens, Kusari-gamas, and tonfas. Meanwhile, those looking for a more toned-down experience can simply toggle the dismemberment feature on and off in the Options menu.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black includes extra elements from the spin-off titles released after the original game’s debut, including the ability to control three additional characters: Momiji, Ayane, and Rachel. The remaster also includes “HERO PLAY STYLE”, a mode for beginners that provides automatic support in the most difficult situations, making the notoriously challenging title more accessible for those who may not be so confident in their action skills.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/ninja-gaiden-4-developer-direct-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Xbox Wire</u></a>, Team Ninja boss Fumihiko Yasuda explained the decision to remaster Ninja Gaiden 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This simultaneous announcement and same-day release alongside Ninja Gaiden 4 might have caught some people by surprise,” he said. “The biggest reason for developing Ninja Gaiden 2 Black was to address the concerns of core fans who might be wondering, ‘What’s going to happen to Ryu Hayabusa?’ We also wanted to give players something to enjoy as they wait for the release of Ninja Gaiden 4. We chose Ninja Gaiden 2 because it stands as one of the most solid action games in the series. We added ‘Black’ to the title to signal to fans that this is the definitive version, much like Ninja Gaiden Black was for the first game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yasuda continued: "This version is crafted to satisfy both those who played the original and newcomers discovering it as a current-generation action game. We’ve meticulously incorporated some of the additions of Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 while staying true to the challenge and feel of the original 360 version, including its signature gore and violence. We’ve also adjusted the weapon upgrade system to more align with the original release.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Ninja’s infamously challenging Ninja Gaiden series has a long association with Xbox. The developer’s reboot of the action series launched first on Xbox in 2004, propelling master ninja Ryu Hayabusa into the mainstream. Ninja Gaiden Black, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-ninja-gaiden-black-is-the-best-pure-action-game-of-all-time"><u>considered one of the greatest action games of all time</u></a>, launched the following year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Gaiden 2 came out in 2008 published by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox 360. Ninja Gaiden 3 followed in 2012 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Since then, fans have had the critically panned spin-off Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z, and, more recently, Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection, a compilation of Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, and Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet - Prismatic Evolutions represents the culmination of the slow build-up to Pokémania 2025. The wild popularity of the set sold preorders out fast, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-where-to-buy-in-stock">stock only now starting to return to shelves and online retailers</a>. But, despite these difficulties, it's quickly become the ultimate crown jewel of the Scarlet and Violet era, delivering fan-favorite Eevee and its evolutions in jaw-dropping Special Illustration Rares and ultra-rare Master Ball foils. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Packed with over 200 cards, including powerhouse Pokémon like Roaring Moon ex and Pikachu ex, this set blends stunning artwork with competitive playability, making it a must-have for trainers and collectors alike. Improved pull rates for Special Illustration Rares sweeten the deal, giving fans a better shot at pulling their dream cards, even as demand hits an all-time high.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/pokmon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-preorders-live-at-best-buy-2-1730736946734.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokemon TCG: Prismatic Evolutions - Elite Trainer Box - Credit: The Pokemon Company.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet, the new sets aren't just about beautiful cards—they're introducing exciting mechanics like Budew's game-changing free attack, and doubling down on rarity tiers to thrill pack-openers. Fancy hunting for the Eeveelution family or stacking your deck with tournament-ready hits? Prismatic Evolutions offers something for everyone. It's not just another expansion; it's the kind of release that defines a generation of Pokémon TCG fans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, in my experience the pulls have been rough in Prismatic Evolutions so far. This won't be the same for everyone, of course. Moreover, on the one hand, it is a good thing; your SIRs and the rest have a much better chance of holding their value. On the other hand, 25 booster packs didn't bring the goods. Let's take a look at some of the exciting new cards that I did manage to bag, and then discuss some of the other exciting (and rare) new additions the expansion brings to see is Prismatic Evolutions is truly worth the hype.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Glaceon ex (Suprise Box Promo Stamp) 026/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-9-1737718353557.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Glaceon ex could end up being a sound playable card by building up enough damage on an opponent's bench to knock it out before it comes into play. The challenge with Tera ex-cards is using multiple energies. However, seeing a Glaceon Tera ex deck in action would be very entertaining.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Eevee Elite Trainer Box Promo 173</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-10-1737718374095.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to its stunning full artwork, this one will likely be in trainers' binders rather than their decks. It's still the standard Eevee card in this set, allowing trainers to evolve it as soon as it's played. It certainly makes playing an Eeveelution deck a lot easier.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mela Trainer SAR 140/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-11-1737718394762.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mela is a powerful trainer card that can be used at the right time. Trainers can grab a fire energy from their discard pile whilst topping up their hand with 6 cards, which would come in handy mid to late game. Again, this is one for a trainer binder, with the usual Mela trainer card being fairly easy to pull.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Pikachu ex 028/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-12-1737718521837.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Prismatic Evolutions also addresses Surging Sparks FOMO with Pikachu ex, although it's not a Tera ex. Thanks to Thunder, it's a relatively straightforward basic ex, with the possibility of one-hit knockouts in three turns. It's a high energy cost, but it's a lovely card to build up from the bench to switch in and out, thanks to its one energy retreat cost.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Max Rod Ace Spec 116/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-13-1737718545967.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This card can literally flip a battle on its head. Imagine having Tyranitar's ex knocked out alongside its four energy cards, then using this Max Rod to get it all back and start building it again from the bench. Probably one of the most useful Ace Specs cards we've seen.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Espeon ex 034/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-14-1737718572842.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Espeon ex decks are going to be very hard to combat thanks to their ability to both discard from an opponent's hand and de-evolve all opposing Pokémon, shuffling the evolution cards into their deck. This one card can drag a battle out and whittle down opponents, so imagine a deck built around four of them. Insane.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tyranitar ex 064/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-15-1737718597512.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At first glance, Grind makes Tyranitar ex very playable. But it's a different story when I consider it a second-stage evolution with a minimum of three energy cards attached to stretch its legs. I love Tyranitar, but this ex-card ain't it, chief. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Prismatic Evolution Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a given that we all want the Eeveelution SIR cards from Prismatic Evolutions. Still, some seriously cool overlooked artwork in this expansion might be worth snapping up if you see a bargain.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dragapult ex SAR 165/131</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-16-1737719041103.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragapult ex SAR 165/131 is one of my favorite artworks from this set, and I'm very tempted to build a deck around Phantom Dive. Two energy costscosts for a combined 260 damage, 60 of which can be spread on your opponent'sopponent's bench. It's an insane move; watch for this card creeping up in value just because trainers want it in their deck.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Roaring Moon ex SIR 162/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-17-1737719796337.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another heavy hitter with Roaring Moon ex-SIR with stunning artwork. A triple hit energy spend for its attacks is brutal, but this basic Pokémon card could be the final push in a tight battle. Loading a deck up with Stadium cards and building support around Roaring Moon ex sounds like a fun deck to build, that's for sure.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Umbreon ex SIR 161/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-18-1737720000986.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, ​I doubt anyone will use an $1200+ Umbreon ex SIR in their decks, but if you take a look at that mental moveset, you'd surely be tempted. Like Roaring Moon ex, this card has the chance of flipping a Pokémon TCG battle on its head in the 11th hour with both of its moves. Yes, it needs three different energy types. Still, there's some fun to be had building out an Eeveelution deck around Umbreon ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, with all things considered, is Prismatic Evolutions worth the hype? In short yes. There are plenty of awesome cards to add to your binder and more playable cards. Still, you'll be waiting for stock to appear without brilliant timing. Eeveelution-based sets will always be cool, but the chances of pulling one of the elusive Eeveelution SIRs is 1 in 900 booster packs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also the addition of God packs and Master Ball cards, which is very cool. Imagine pulling every SIR in one booster pack? The problem is it's very unlikely to happen, so strap in and get ripping packs and boxes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Pokémon TCG: Prismatic Evolutions in 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Stock has been hard to come by for Pokémon TCG: Prismatic Evolutions, and things are only now starting to even out a little. Pokémon is at the height of popularity again, between TCG Pocket, investors buying up stock, and general increased demand for sets such as Surging Sparks, it's a crazy time to get into the hobby. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-company-breaks-silence-on-prismatic-evolution-shortage">The Pokémon Company's efforts to restock shelves ASAP</a>, Prismatic Evolutions also represent a turning point of going online or in-store to buy stock instead of resorting to the questionable secondary market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Prismatic Evolutions collection offers a range of products for collectors and players, each celebrating the beloved Eeveelutions. At the top, the Elite Trainer Box provides nine booster packs, an exclusive full-art Eevee promo, and useful extras like sleeves, dice, and condition markers—ideal for anyone building their collection or deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a simpler option, the Surprise Box includes a few booster packs and a random Eeveelution ex promo with a Prismatic Evolutions stamp, offering an affordable way to dip into the set. Similarly, the Mini Tin is a compact choice with two booster packs, a collectible Eevee coin, and an art card, doubling as a neat storage solution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collectors will appreciate the Binder Collection, which pairs four booster packs with a sturdy Eevee-themed binder for organizing prized cards like Master Ball foils or Special Illustration Rares. The Tech Sticker Collection adds a playful touch with Eevee stickers and two booster packs, perfect for younger fans or casual fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, the Poster Collection combines display-worthy content with collectibility, featuring three booster packs, a fold-out Eevee poster, and exclusive holo promos of Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon. Each product highlights the magic of the Prismatic Evolutions set, offering something for every kind of Pokémon fan, whether you're chasing rare cards, organizing your collection, or simply enjoying the Eevee hype.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
