            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I have always loved jigsaw puzzles. They are the perfect combination of relaxation and challenge that just seems to fire off all the right neurons for me. But it wasn't until fairly recently that I got really into collecting puzzles. Because of this job, I spend a surprising amount of time browsing Amazon deals and have found that puzzles are discounted almost every month. So naturally, every time there's a big sale I end up buying at least one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no surprise that Amazon is having a huge puzzle sale once again for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/amazon-prime-day">Prime Day</a>. This is the biggest collection of jigsaw puzzle deals I have seen all year and the discounts are very tempting. I'm doing my best to limit my spending this year, but this sale might just break me. If you're interested in picking up some cheap puzzles yourself, I've gathered some of the best options below. You can also check out all of the Prime Day puzzle sales by clicking the first link I've featured below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Puzzle Deals at Amazon Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has had a lot of different types of puzzle sales and this one is sort of mish-mash of all of them. That means that some of the options I've featured here are lightning deals, some have coupons, and some are just straight up discounts (like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theory11-jigsaw-puzzles-and-playing-cards-prime-day-2025">theory11 puzzles</a>). The last sale like this I covered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-has-stacking-discounts-on-cool-1000-piece-puzzles-today">included some complicated stacking coupons</a>, but thankfully none of that is necessary this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">best puzzle brands</a> are included here, including popular Ravensburger puzzles. You can usually judge the quality of the puzzle by both the brand and the price, so some of the cheaper options I've listed here might not be as nice as the puzzles that cost $15 or more. The extra amount you pay is really just for the extra thickness of the cardboard used so you don't get any really flimsy pieces.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What's the best piece count for jigsaw puzzles?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're new to the puzzle game, you may be wondering what size puzzle you should get. Most jigsaw puzzles that are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzles-for-adults">targeted at adults</a> or teens can range anywhere between 300 and 5,000 pieces. There are some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/largest-jigsaw-puzzles">much larger puzzles</a> that go way beyond that, but unless you're looking for a massive challenge, I'd suggest you stick in the 300 to 1,000 piece range. One of the most common piece counts for adults is 1,000 pieces, but a 500-piece puzzle can be just as fun to put together with half the pieces. Deciding which puzzle size is right for you is more about how much time and space you have to actually put it together.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Consider a Puzzle Table or Board</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're serious about puzzling like me, I'd suggest also looking into picking up a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-tables">decent puzzle table or board</a>. Having a dedicated space to put your puzzles together will save you a lot of stress. I have a dedicated puzzle area in my home office right now and I'm able to leave it and come back to it easily without worrying about pieces disappearing or taking up the entire dining room table for weeks at a time. Jigsaw puzzling should not be a stressful activity and being able to dedicate a space or pack it up when you aren't actively puzzling can help maintain that level of leisure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Day has a lot of deals on puzzle tables, boards, and storage accessories right now. If you're interested in picking something up for yourself, here are some of my top recommendations. All of these make for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-gifts">great gifts for any puzzler</a> in your life as well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Board Games Are Also on Sale Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to all of the puzzle deals, it's also worth noting that there are some pretty incredible <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-deals-prime-day-2025">board game deals for Prime Day</a> this year. Here are some of our top picks below:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jacob Kienlen is a Senior SEO Strategist and Writer for IGN.

Considering you are reading this on IGN right now, there’s a strong chance that hearing “Balatro” instead fills you with images of poker hands and Ben Starr dressed in clown make-up as Jimbo, the star of last year's breakout title that has taken the gaming world by storm (and was nominated for IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-winners-the-full-list">Game of the Year 2024</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you have spent hours in the game or are just interested in jumping in and seeing what the hype is all about, the Nintendo Switch version of Balatro is currently $19.99 – down from $29.99 – as a part of Amazon’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-2025-sale-top-deals-live">Prime Day sale</a>.</p><p id="balatro-special-edition-switch"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Balatro Special Edition (Switch)">Balatro Special Edition (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="2ed53419-10a0-4555-b252-6b19b2d22951" id="225015"><div id="225015" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Balatro Special Edition (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In Balatro, you earn points by playing various Poker hands in an effort to score high enough to complete a string of levels. The better you do, the more money you have to spend on upgrades. These upgrades can improve the bonuses you get from different kinds of hands, like two-of-a-kind or straights, augmenting your playing cards with special properties. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's most notorious feature is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/balatro/Every_Balatro_Joker">special Joker cards</a> that impart unique multipliers depending on what cards you play. It sounds more complicated than it is, and by the time you complete a run or two, you will get why this game is so popular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Made by a single developer, LocalThunk, Balatro has taken home numerous awards since it first released on Steam in February of last year, and one of the biggest indie game hits in recent memory. In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/balatro-review">review</a>, Simon Cardy said, “Remarkably approachable with complex systems waiting for those willing to lose themselves to it, Balatro successfully assembles the infinitely fun gameplay loop that every great roguelike sets out to create.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you're a Balatro pro looking for a new platform to play the game on or just looking for a new game on your Switch, I can't recommend this deal enough! </p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">More Prime Day Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year's Prime Day sale features <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-deals-amazon-prime-day-2025">tons of discounts on physical games</a>.
