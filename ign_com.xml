            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">New look, new tools, same core gameplay.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The We Were Here series is the stuff of co-op magic, and at IGN Fan Fest 2026 we got to see its latest evolution. One look at the We Were Here Tomorrow trailer and it's clear the cult co-op series is taking a giant leap into new territory. Previously set in the labyrinthine rooms of an abandoned castle, We Were Here Tomorrow sets its perplexing puzzles in the raygun retrofuturistic looking Norcek facility. The core of the game – shouting at your friend through a walkie talkie as they prove to be dumber than you ever thought possible – remains the same, but there are other changes to go with the new look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a story that has some familiar characters and some totally new ones, and we've also done a lot with giving you new tools for puzzle solving and moving through the environment," said Martín Mittner, creative director at Total Mayhem games. "And we've done a ton of work on the walkie-talkies to keep you in the game instead of on Discord."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Sci-Fi or Fantasy Movie of 2025</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you've yet to experience the sometimes chaotic communication of the We Were Here series, there are two key roles: the Explorer and the Librarian. Usually the Explorer is the one faced with physically interacting with the puzzles, while the Librarian translates information only they can see through the walkie talkie that's key to the solution. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What I'm really excited about is accentuating the differences between the two players even more, introducing a bit more asymmetry and giving each player a really unique perspective [and] role in the whole playthrough," added Thijs Schippers, the game's design director. "Yeah, that's in the DNA of this new title, through and through."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both talked about how, as well as giving the designers a chance to work on something other than snowy castles, the change in setting allows for new environments and new setups for puzzles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you've played We Were Here Forever, we did this what we called 'mind-bendy puzzle,' where you're inside a D12 die and you're doing these weird warps between dimensions and getting different information and stuff," said Mittner. "We're doing some more of that, right? There are sort of capstone puzzles that we're presenting that are very mind-bendy. It'll be really interesting to see players play through that. And also there's like a unique aspect to the storytelling we're doing that I can't really talk too in depth about. But it's going to be very different in some ways from previous titles. And it will be interesting to see how the players interact with each other surrounding the story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We Were Here Tomorrow is coming to PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Head over to Steam and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2315050/Where_Are_We/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add the game to your Wishlist</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is just the latest news from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-fan-fest-2026-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect">IGN's Fan Fest 2026</a> – check the schedule to see what else is coming and to keep up to date on all the latest from the worlds of games and entertainment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Head of Editorial Development at IGN and an elder millennial.

            <guid>1447747</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">I first took notice of Samson: A Tyndalston Story when its team of former Just Cause and Mad Max developers posted a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it <a href="https://x.com/LiquidSwords/status/1983169469804622067" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teaser</u></a> of Tyndalston itself. The fictional city reminded me of GTA 3’s Liberty City or Max Payne’s New York. My <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-ex-just-cause-devs-samson-aims-to-be-like-mad-maxpayne"><u>first look at proper gameplay</u></a> in a demo with the creative director only upped my interest, and now that I’ve had the chance to actually play Samson – albeit only for an all-too-brief hour – I’m officially amped for this gritty, grimy, run-down brawler with pseudo-open world freedom where your heavy punch can drop bad guys in one bloody shot and you pop painkillers to stay in the fight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The setup for this 1990’s-set crime story sees you as Samson McCray, fresh out of prison after eating a charge as a result of a robbery in St. Louis gone bad. Your sister, Oonagh, pulled some strings to help keep you safe while you were inside, and she cut a deal upon your release: you’ve got to repay the money lost from the failed heist to people that will absolutely kill you both if you come even one cent short. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s important to make clear up front is that Samson is not a AAA game. You’d be forgiven for thinking it was at first glance, because its Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals are quite impressive, both in terms of Samson’s character model and the city of Tyndalston. Lighting has a very fluorescent-tinged yellow tint to it that you really had to live through the ‘90s to understand, vehicles look great, and the city itself looks very, very lived-in. But Samson doesn’t have the scope of a AAA game, and that’s not a complaint – it’s just important to properly calibrate your expectations. The opening cutscene is not a full-blown cinematic but a voiced-over motion-comic, voice acting is so-so at best, and this isn’t a 40+ hour open-world sandbox. You do plenty of driving around a neighborhood – perhaps more of Tyndalston unlocks the further into the story you progress – but this is not a massive playground full of chatty NPCs and side activities. </p><p>I really like the choices that Samson makes within its more limited scope. <span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, this isn’t a complaint, but it’s important to emphasize because when you first fire up Samson, it seems like it’s following a very GTA-esque playbook. But I really like the choices that Samson makes within its more limited scope. For instance, there are numerous little things around the world to take note of and interact with, from notes and photos in your apartment to sandwich-board signs you can knock over with your car in order to gain small bursts of nitro boost.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It gets better: there is a progression system. The more bad guys you beat up and the more missions you complete, the more XP you earn that gets redeemed for a point in one of four skills: Instinct (boosts your adrenaline), Tactics (health), Aggression (power), and Cunning (finesse). This allows you to tailor your Samson to your preferred playstyle, whether you’d rather absorb and dish out maximum punishment in each fight or strike quickly and frequently in order to speed up the maxing out of your adrenaline meter, at which point you can click in both thumbsticks and enjoy a brief period of dealing extra damage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay segments are split into days, and within each day are afternoon, evening, and night. Every time the sun rises, you have to pay back a certain amount of your debt. In order to do that, you’ll need to take various small jobs around Tyndalston. Fortunately, you’ve got choices each day; it’s not a linear mission structure. My first job involved finding the manager of a club called Chubb’s and, well, beating the crap out of him. Naturally, it wasn’t quite so simple. I had to worm my way through the bowels of the club first, fighting my way through his goons in the process. This mission functioned as a bit of a tutorial, allowing me to practice parries, dodges, light punches, heavy punches, and triggering my adrenaline meter after I’d built up enough adrenaline during fights. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Samson Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It didn’t hurt Samson’s chances of me loving this game when the <em>very first dude </em>I threw a heavy punch at dropped immediately, his face covered in his own blood. Most of the time in a game like this, guys can take an unrealistic number of hits. But not in Samson. Not everyone will hit the floor after a single punch, but the fact that it can happen not only made me feel like a badass, but it added to the underworld grittiness that is clearly oozing out of every square inch of Tyndalston.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, back to the missions: as I was saying, you’ve got choices at each segment of the day, but each choice takes a certain amount of time. Meaning, you can’t just do a dozen jobs in a single day in order to quickly pay down your debt and break the game. Every job, realistically, takes time, so when I was, for example, shadowing Dave the Bookie, that took all afternoon of in-game time. First I had to drive to where Dave had last been seen. Then, once I’d clocked him, I had to follow him from a safe distance (lest he recognize the tail and get spooked, triggering a mission failure) so that he’d lead me to evidence of what he was suspected of by the people that I took the job from: that Dave was playing both sides. Sure enough, I caught Dave red-handed, and then I had to square up against Dave and his associates. By the time it was done and I got paid, the day moved to evening.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Samson: A Tyndalston Story - February 2026 Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some jobs can only be taken at certain times of day. And some jobs will cost you money. Like when I had to take out the cars of two guys who were avoiding my temporary employer. First I drove to where they’d last been seen, and then both cars came flying around the corner in front of me and the chase was on. The problem was, my car was already pretty beat up from the erratic driving I’d been doing in previous jobs. So the first time I tried the mission, my pursuit led us to a freeway onramp, where I was able to get behind the closest of the two target cars, and then nitro-boost directly into his rear bumper, slamming his car into the curving wall of the onramp and taking it out. Problem was, the bumper boost also took my pre-battered car out, and by the time I’d grabbed another car, the second of the two cars I was pursuing – who was already in front of me – had gotten away. </p><p>The melee combat system feels heavy in a really good way.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the retry, I stopped at a gas station repair shop first, spent some of my hard-earned cash (which, I remind you, I needed every cent of to try and make my daily debt payment), and was then able to keep my car intact while taking out both of my four-wheeled targets. I got paid, and headed home for the evening. But who was waiting for me? Two debt collectors, and so before I could crash on my own couch for the night, I had to bloody my knuckles one more time.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/liquidswords-samson-01-1772065215823.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Both combat and driving were a lot of fun in my one-hour hands-on. I have no idea if Samson will ever introduce guns into the mix, but I kinda hope it doesn’t. The melee combat system feels heavy in a really good way, meaning that Samson takes shots just as hard as he dishes them out. I like the mix of punches, parries, and dodging. Sure, the Batman: Arkham combat arguably remains the brawler standard, but Samson’s fisticuffs are slower and more deliberate in a way I quite enjoy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Driving, meanwhile, also has a welcome weight to it. All of the (fictional) cars in Samson are ‘90s era at the newest, given the ‘90s setting. Samson’s own car is a ‘70s Chevelle-like two-door muscle car, and as such it’s no light Lotus. Are these simulation-style driving physics? Absolutely not. You have the aforementioned nitro boosts and there’s a side-slam button – and of course, the B button lets you pull off sick handbrake turns once you’ve got some practice under your belt. By the end of my hour I had really started to get the hang of the driving and was eager to zip my way around Tyndalston some more. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/liquidswords-samson-city-02-1772065237509.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can probably tell by now, I had a fantastic time in Tyndalston. If Samson can keep its mission variety fresh – which is no small thing, I recognize – it’ll go a long way towards making its campaign enjoyable over the long haul, versus the extremely fun hour I had with it. I’m curious to see if the city opens up more as the story unfolds, and I hope the story itself is engaging enough to keep me motivated to continue playing and isn’t just “keep doing jobs to pay down your debt until a big climactic mission happens at the end.” Samson is due out on April 8 for PC, so it won’t be too long before we find out if it can keep up the good stuff it’s got going for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our semi-retired interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.
