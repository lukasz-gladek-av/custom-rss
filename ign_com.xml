            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nexus-mods-owner-steps-down-after-24-years-to-focus-on-mental-health<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">PC gaming mod hub Nexus Mods is under new ownership for the first time in 24 years as creator Robin “Dark0ne” Scott hands off the baton for the sake of his mental health.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The figurehead of one of the biggest gaming sites on the internet posted about its next chapter in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301?mtm_kwd=newsfeed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a message</u></a> published today. It comes with confirmation that Scott has already officially stepped away from Nexus Mods, “following months of meetings, face-to-face talks, and a whole lot of soul searching.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The message keeps many of the behind-the-scenes details under wraps but says two new individuals — one named Victor (a.k.a. <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Foledinho" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Foledinho</u></a>) and another named Marinus (a.k.a. <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/rapsak" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rapsak</u></a>) — have adopted the leadership role, with both of their profiles now bearing the “Site Owner” title. The leadership change signals the beginning of a new era for Nexus Mods, and for Scott, a much-needed break.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll,” Scott explained. “The stress of the job has been a regular source of anxiety and stress-related health issues. I realised that I have been burning out and this started to have an impact on my staff and Nexus Mods as a whole. So, I firmly believe that the best thing for the future of Nexus Mods is for me to step aside and bring in new leadership to steer the business forward with renewed energy to make Nexus Mods the modding community we all truly deserve.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The small project born in Scott’s bedroom for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind eventually ballooned into a massive entity in the gaming space. The Nexus Mods <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/about" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>About Us page</u></a> notes that this beating heart of the PC gaming community is made up of 63.4 million users and 16.8 billion file downloads, positioning it as one of the most highly trafficked UK-based websites on the planet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Nexus Mods has grown, so too has its impact on Scott, who has spent “every single day” for more than 20 years “on call.” Losing his direct input in the day-to-day operations of Nexus Mods will surely result in some changes, but Scott assured modders and gamers alike that the shift should not be cause for concern.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“Behind the scenes, I’ve already been stepping back bit by bit,” Scott clarifies. “Over the past few years, the team has taken on more of the weight and the site’s been doing better than ever. What’s changing now is simply the formality of it, making sure the right people are in place to guide Nexus Mods into the next era.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scott says his stepping down from Nexus Mods, as well as a few small structural changes, are moves made to ensure “long-term stability” and won’t impact how the site has been operating recently. He goes as far as to say, “Nexus Mods is community-first and mod-author focused, that’s not up for negotiation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Scott steps away from his direct leadership position, the modding creator says he’ll still engage with the Nexus Mods community on its Mod Author Discord, forums, and more. He’ll also help guide the site’s 40-person team as the page is turned, relieving his duties as its face and figurehead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So yes, the ownership of Nexus Mods has changed hands, but I want to be clear, this isn’t some corporate ‘exit’ or a backroom deal,” Scott adds. “This is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nexus Mods has housed thousands of fan-made creations for games like franchises like The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Stardew Valley, Baldur’s Gate, Cyberpunk 2077, and many, many more for decades. In fact, just moments after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion shadow-dropped earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-mods-have-already-been-published-online">dozens of minor mods had already been published on the site</a>. It’s the go-to place for PC gamers to modify their games to their liking, and with its first change in leadership in 24 years comes a fair amount of uncertainty for its future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/art-of-borderlands-4-book-release-date-where-to-buy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The book costs $55.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 will be arriving in September 2025 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-where-to-buy">preorders have already started going live</a>. After some initial controversy around the cost of the game, the price has officially been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-standard-edition-price-set-at-70-after-all">confirmed by 2K Games</a>. At $70 for the standard edition, the newest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-games-in-order">Borderlands game in the series</a> is going to be the most expensive so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands is set to release on September 12, but there is another related preorder that won't come out until later that same month. The Art of Borderlands 4 oversized coffee table book that features art and commentary from the game's development will be released on September 30. At $55, it is priced closer to what the previous standard edition video games were at launch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder The Art of Borderlands 4 Book</h2><div catalogid="fb8ef5f1-c9e0-48f9-bf13-2cc15119b5e0" id="223041"><div id="223041" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Art of Borderlands 4</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Art of Borderlands 4 was <a href="https://gamerant.com/art-of-borderlands-4-official-artbook-cover-reveal/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced last month</a> when the cover was officially revealed. The book itself will feature 224 pages in a 9x12-inch format that is perfect for coffee tables or your bookshelf. It features a mixture of sketches, line art, concept art, and commentary about how all of these things went into the development of the new game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a release date of September 30, the main downside of this art book is that it won't arrive until after the game. So if you were hoping to get an early look at how Borderlands 4 came together visually before you play the game itself, you're out of luck. If you're just a fan of the Borderlands series and want to add this book to your collection, however, it's worth checking out.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Amazon's Preorder Price Guarantee?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've never actually preordered anything from Amazon before, it's worth noting that if you purchase this art book ahead of the release date, it includes Amazon's preorder price guarantee. According to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G4BRP7LCB9DSDNCR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon's own help page</a>, this means that if the price decreases between now and when the item ships, you'll pay the lowest price. So in this case, if this preorder gets a discount before the book actually starts shipping then you'll pay whatever it dropped to rather than the full price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although not every preorder gets discounted, physical editions of books seem to drop in price fairly often compared to other product categories. With Borderlands 4 arriving a full two weeks ahead of this art book, it seems likely we could see a preorder discount appear somewhere in that window this fall.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 16, 2025 5:14 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
