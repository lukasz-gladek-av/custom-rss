Ed Annunziata — the original creator of the famed and fiendishly difficult action-adventure games — was interviewed about raising awareness of ocean conservation, his life as a developer, and, right at the end, he dropped his bombshell revelation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">California-based developer A&amp;R Atelier, at which Annunziata works, revealed in a press release that it is remastering Ecco the Dolphin and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ecco-the-tides-of-time"><u>Ecco: The Tides of Time</u></a>, as well as that all-important third game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It has been years in the making, and we’re honored to bring Ecco back,” Annunziata said (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/multiple-ecco-the-dolphin-games-officially-in-development" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Gematsu</u></a>). “Ecco has always been more than a game about a dolphin — he’s a bridge between worlds.” Sadly, that's essentially where the details stop, but the developer said to keep an eye on both its <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>website</u></a> and the official <a href="https://discord.gg/98P3J2SDt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Discord</u></a> for more information.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">10 (Unintentionally) Terrifying Games</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ecco the Dolphin originally launched in 1992 on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, and was followed by a sequel, Ecco: The Tides of Time, in 1994. Ecco Jr. and Ecco Jr. and the Great Ocean Treasure Hunt were released in 1995, although they were "edutainment" games and primarily developed as learning tools. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as the titular dolphin, your underwater world now devastated by a swirling gust of air and water. You must help him navigate back through treacherous tropical reefs and freezing polar ice floes to reunite him with his dolphin pod. There have been a few remasters since: we thought the 2000 remake was okay, writing: "Ecco the Dolphin is a classic from SEGA, but sometimes classics should stay in the past," and of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/17/ecco-the-dolphin-review">2007 remake,</a> we wrote: "For those who have played Ecco before, there's really no reason to come back to it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last Ecco the Dolphin game — ostensibly the "third" game, although Annunziata wasn't involved — fared much better, however, getting a 7.6 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ecco-the-dolphin-defender-of-the-future"><u>IGN's Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future review</u></a>. A further sequel, Ecco 2: Sentinels of the Universe, which had been written as a direct sequel to Defender of the Future, was cancelled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
