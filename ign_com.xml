            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We feel really good about the title."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re now half a year since the troubled launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a>, which has fewer players on Steam than both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization 6</a> and the 15-year-old <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-v">Civilization 5</a>. But according to the boss of Take-Two, Civ 7 is projected to meet the company's initial internal expectations over the course of its lifetime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Civilization 7 has had a rough launch on Steam and has struggled for players on Valve’s platform ever since its launch in February. Reaction is ‘mixed,’ according to Steam user reviews. Civ 7’s Steam performance does not paint the entire picture, of course. The strategy game also launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch (the Nintendo Switch 2 version and a VR version recently launched, too). But Civilization’s bread and butter is PC, and there Civ 7 is clearly struggling.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN to discuss Take-Two’s hugely positive financial results for the latest 2025 quarter, CEO Strauss Zelnick admitted Civ 7 had got off to a “slow start,” but he insisted that the company’s internal projections for what he called the “lifetime value” of Civ 7 still match its initial expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's definitely improving,” Zelnick said of Civ 7 (Take-Two has yet to announce a sales figure for the game).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the key thing is that Civ has always been a slow burn. It's always been a title that had — I'm not really a big believer in the long tail theory of the entertainment business — but Civ is an example of that theory. And right now our projections for the lifetime value of the title are very consistent with our initial expectations for the title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So while we were off to a slow start and while we have had to make changes — and there are more changes coming — I feel like consumer uptake is better and better and we feel really good about the title. I think over time it's going to take its place in its civilization pantheon in a very successful, credible way.”</p><div id="rank-every-civilization-game" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank every Civilization Game</h3><h3>Rank every Civilization Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When Civ 7 launched, players highlighted issues with the user interface, a lack of map variety, and expressed a feeling that the game launched without a number of features they’d come to expect from the franchise. But some veteran Civ fans also didn’t get on well with the dramatic changes developer Firaxis made to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A full campaign in Civilization 7 is one that goes through all three Ages: Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern. Once the Age is completed, all players (and any AI opponents) experience an Age Transition simultaneously. During an Age Transition, three things happen: you select a new civilization from the new Age to represent your empire, you choose which Legacies you want to retain in the new Age, and the game world evolves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Civilization games have never had such a system, and it has proven divisive. But Firaxis has launched a number of key updates to Civ 7 since launch, most recently patch 1.2.3, which made Age Transition improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, can Firaxis turn Civilization 7 sentiment around from its current ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam, and get more people to make the jump from past Civ games to the latest effort?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got plenty more from our interview with Strauss Zelnick, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-strauss-zelnick-says-borderlands-chief-randy-pitchford-can-be-controversial-at-times-sometimes-intentionally-sometimes-unintentionally-but-i-still-love-him-to-death">his thoughts on controversial Borderlands developer Randy Pitchford</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question">his response to recent reports around the troubled BioShock 4</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

But late on Saturday, McDonald's was forced to acknowledge it had already mostly sold out of the cards in less than 24 hours — meaning anyone without them already would now likely miss out. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/untitled-1-1754903573029.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A fan shows dozens of Pokémon card packs, while bags of uneaten Happy Meals sit dumped.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Thank you for your continued patronage of McDonald's," the chain wrote in an official apology <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0809b/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>.

Please refrain from contacting stores regarding stock availability."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dozens of posts on social media have expressed shock at the amount of food waste generated by fans during the promotion, as customers bought up dozens of Happy Meals just for their cards — and online listings for the packs began to appear with heavily inflated prices. Numerous photos show discarded Happy Meals, still stacked up in plastic bags, abandoned on the street or left within the McDonald's restaurant they were bought in.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">何の対策もせずに<br>とりあえず売れれば良いという<br>腐り切った商魂で<br>多くの子ども達を泣かせて<br>外国人転売ヤーを笑顔にする<br>マクドナルドのハッピーセット <a href="https://t.co/VtOmtTFFAB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/VtOmtTFFAB</a></p>— ベリ (@092ne) <a href="https://twitter.com/092ne/status/1954093769994731885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%9E%E3%82%AF%E3%83%89%E3%83%8A%E3%83%AB%E3%83%89%E3%83%8F%E3%83%83%E3%83%94%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BB%E3%83%83%E3%83%88?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#マクドナルドハッピーセット</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E5%A4%A7%E9%87%8F%E7%A0%B4%E6%A3%84?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#大量破棄</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%9E%E3%82%AF%E3%83%89%E3%83%8A%E3%83%AB%E3%83%89%E8%B2%AC%E4%BB%BB%E8%BF%BD%E5%8F%8A?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#マクドナルド責任追及</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%9E%E3%82%AF%E3%83%89%E3%83%8A%E3%83%AB%E3%83%89%E4%B8%8D%E8%B2%B7%E9%81%8B%E5%8B%95?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#マクドナルド不買運動</a><br>マクドナルド責任追及すべきでは<br>繰り返される食べ物をこんな事件<br>何回か事件あったのに対策しない<br>中国人転売やーよりマクドナルド責任はある。<br>本当にマクドナルド不買運動すべき <a href="https://t.co/TmaElG5z5k" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/TmaElG5z5k</a></p>— 国分寺　弥 (@wadaoudanhodou) <a href="https://twitter.com/wadaoudanhodou/status/1954119665963221328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/pokemon-tcg-mcdonalds-japan-campaign-draws-disgust-and-flak-for-food-waste-and-chaos/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NintendoSoup</a>, the following videos show customers arguing over McDonald's five Happy Meals per patron limit, and then a police officer responding to a report of an argumentative fan upset they had bought a large number of Happy Meals only to find no cards were included (presumably because stock had already run out).</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— まっつんtype3.0 (@san_san_san333) <a href="https://twitter.com/san_san_san333/status/1954060122843754889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr"><p>拡散して‼️</p><p>大阪のマクドナルドでハッピーセットのおまけのポケカが貰えないから返品させろと要求している外国人転売ヤー‼️💢</p><p>中国人だかベトナム人だか知らないが、こんな事で警察の手を煩わせるんじゃねーよ💢</p><p>悪質外国人は日本から出てけ‼️<br>日本の子供達がポケカ貰えなくて悲しんでるだろ💢 <a href="https://t.co/aqzvEPahYt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/aqzvEPahYt</a></p></div>— ティトン (@bcfe70bord) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcfe70bord/status/1954131843088871429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">This is by no means the first popular Pokémon card giveaway at McDonald's, but it appears to have been one of the most chaotic so far.
