            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/1-year-later-helldivers-2-players-fear-a-return-to-malevelon-creek-is-on-the-way<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Few places hold as much shared history for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> players as Malevelon Creek. Around this time last year, it was the site of a massive Automaton incursion, with divers fighting through a hail of scrap and laser-fire. Now, it seems like we might be heading back to the Creek.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its most recent update, Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Studios announced in-game that players had failed the most recent Major Order. The Automaton Incineration Corps, armed with powerful flame weaponry, made significant gains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The enemy remains at large," the notification read. "Reports indicate the enemy's strategic goal is to seize old industrial assets in the Severin Sector, where the Automatons first emerged."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Helldivers NOW (@Helldivers_NOW) <a href="https://twitter.com/Helldivers_NOW/status/1903982258140422562?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Severin Sector is home to several planets, chiefly Malevelon Creek, where players <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-players-liberate-malevelon-creek-in-hours-to-redeem-one-of-their-biggest-major-order-failures">took the planet back</a> in a last-ditch effort against the Automatons in April 2024. It was a stunning experience for anyone who dropped into it, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-community-mourns-the-loss-of-space-vietnam-map-malevelon-creek-but-the-fightback-has-already-begun">players fought to re-take the Creek after initially losing it</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The phrase "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1brm27h/i_finally_understand_why_malevelon_creek_is/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robot Vietnam</a>" was tossed around, thanks to Malevelon Creek's dense jungle environment. It became so notable that Arrowhead <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-gives-all-players-a-special-commemorative-cape-for-malevelon-creek-memorial-day">released a cape commemorating the fight</a> to reclaim the planet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with the prospect of Automatons returning the sector to take territory, potentially armed with flame weaponry, Helldivers are gearing up for a scrap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A part of me is in fear as I was there but another part of me WANTS to go back," one Reddit user wrote, in response to a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1jib6a8/theyre_heading_for_the_creek/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post about the Major Order update</a>. "... a part of me never left," another responded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some expressed terror at returning, while others are ready to hold out again. "I fought hard for that planet once, and I'm prepared to do so a second time," one user <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1jib6a8/theyre_heading_for_the_creek/mje4ou1/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Major Order failure has raised another point of concern for Helldivers 2 players, though. As <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ji5cwt/this_mo_was_designed_to_teach_us_defense_gambits/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one post outlined</a>, some Major Orders can feel frustrating to accomplish, organize around, or not feel incentivized. As responders note, the active player base can also vary, which can make quantity-driven Orders difficult if they're not based around the current average.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One player <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ji5cwt/this_mo_was_designed_to_teach_us_defense_gambits/mjcv9ev/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">puts it succinctly</a>: "Stop giving us kill quantity MOs when the player base can vary by up to 70k over the course of a single week." Further replies suggest percentage-based scaling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Failure can make for interesting storytelling, as proven by the initial fight at Malevelon Creek. Heading into what feels like a major moment for Helldivers 2 though, it'll be interesting to see how Arrowhead handles it all. Alongside teasing a return to one of its most infamous battle sites, the team has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-players-are-looking-for-hidden-messages-amid-black-hole-disaster">also sent a black hole directly towards Super Earth</a>. There's no shortage of threats for the Helldivers these days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
