            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hyper-light-breaker-review-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">So far this roguelike feels hyper light on content and the wrong kind of broken.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Normally, when a sequel is announced that’s a wild departure from the original, I welcome it with open arms – look no further than my inexplicable but everlasting love of Banjo-Kazooie Nuts N Bolts as evidence. But after just a day with Hyper Light Breaker – a follow-up (though not a proper sequel) to one of my all-time favorite indie games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/14/hyper-light-drifter-review"><u>Hyper Light Drifter</u></a> – I feel like Vito Corleone telling y’all to look at how they massacred my boy. I’ve only sunk six hours into this incredibly challenging co-op roguelike so far, and although there’s clearly the skeleton of a good action-RPG in here somewhere, it’s currently buried deeper than the sun can see under sloppy combat mechanics, shallow and frustrating exploration, and scant content that began to feel repetitive only two hours in. Of course, this is its early access launch, so there’s always hope an initially rough package will transform into something much better with enough time – but in terms of what’s here right now, my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The goal of a run is to hunt around a randomized map for better gear and key items before taking on three highly deadly and supremely irritating bosses hiding out on each map, then extract yourself back to base to regroup, buy some upgrades, and do it again. I’ve already bested a couple bosses, which summon minions endlessly and flop around erratically to do massive damage, but have yet to complete a map in its entirety, which I’m assuming won’t happen until I near the end of what’s currently available in early access. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat makes an absolutely terrible first impresion.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe the combat will grow on me once I get deeper in, but it makes an absolutely terrible first impression. There isn’t anything interesting about the melee hack-and-slash attacks you are given, the alternative third-person shooting option has very limited ammo, moving and dodging feel unresponsive and inconsistent, and the lock-on system constantly toggles itself off unexpectedly and gets me killed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these things are especially frustrating when Hyper Light Breaker is immediately difficult – and I mean <em>extremely </em>difficult, and that’s coming from someone with all the achievements in Sekiro – but doesn’t bother to explain its rules and often punishes you with an onslaught of enemy attacks that feel cheap. It’s also extremely funny that you start with no healing items (and are only given them at great expense and extremely sparingly) when you’d think you would need them most at the beginning when you’re learning. Instead, you basically have to throw yourself at impossible odds until you can unlock the bare minimum you need to survive.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So I’ve spent most of my time running around procedurally generated worlds that at least look quite pretty, using a unique art style that channels Hyper Light Drifter in 3D quite well. But these repetitive areas are extremely irritating to navigate, filled with awkward cliffs and crooked landscapes that feel like I’m not actually supposed to be climbing them but offer me no other choice. On the bright side, they at least give you a neat hoverboard to ride around on and do tricks, and although the controls are as sloppy as everything else, hoverboards are indeed still dope as hell and there are definitely some good times to be had there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve got a whole lot left to do and see before I’m ready to finalize my review sometime next week, and it's a little encouraging that combat is becoming a bit more bearable as I start to understand its unpolished ways and gain more than zero healing items. But so far I’m not having a good time, and that’s not what I was expecting from this long-awaited follow-up, even taking into account this is its early access launch.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-the-monster-hunter-wilds-team-select-their-beastly-lineup-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you ask people who the main characters are in Monster Hunter, they might say “the hunters” – but others will tell you: “It’s all about the monsters.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So many striking creatures have appeared over the course of Monster Hunter’s 20-plus-year history. With each new hunter and each new hunt, we form new memories around these monsters. That's why players have pored over information about the new monsters appearing in the latest title, Monster Hunter Wilds, and why they let out shouts of joy when they heard that certain monsters would be making a long-awaited return.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">IGN First Monster Hunter Wilds Oilwell Basin Artwork</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In this interview with Kaname Fujioka, who was the director of the first Monster Hunter and now Executive Director and Art Director for Wilds, and Yuya Tokuda, director of both Monster Hunter: World and Wilds, we get to hear in detail about the process that new and returning monsters went through before appearing in Wilds, with a special focus on the processes of creation and selection. Throughout the interview, I felt the deep love that these developers have for their monsters, as well as the ceaseless work they've put into giving those monsters the greatest stage possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokuda first explains the process that goes into the creation of a Monster Hunter monster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We first consider what we want players to experience when facing major monsters like Arkveld, as well as the setting, ecosystem and so on of the world, unique to each title,” he tells IGN. “We then think about the kind of monsters needed to do that. In a way, we start by putting puzzle pieces together, like, ‘If this monster exists in this place, how does the ecological pyramid work here?’”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to simply think that players will be happy so long as popular monsters make a reappearance, but the development team actually focuses most on the player's experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We don't focus too much on the proportion or number of new versus old monsters,” continues Tokuda. “What's important at the end of the day is the overall level design and order of monsters across the entire game, as well as the balance of ecological pyramids in each area. We take this multifaceted approach to decide which monsters to include." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">How will players play the game, and when will they encounter each monster? What will we see monsters doing in this latest title enabled by new technology? Fujioka says that this approach is extremely important, even when choosing to have older monsters make a reappearance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"So even when we're selecting old monsters to put in the game, part of that involves making sure to stay true to that monster's concept while thinking about how much room each monster has to grow when they're reborn using current-day technology and game design," he says.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Setting the stage</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the monsters that live in the Forbidden Lands (or as the developers call it, "The East") like Doshaguma, which embodies the game's herd system, there are some monsters that quickly present new ways of hunting spread across the world of Wilds. During the open beta test in November, many players encountered Chatacabra, or Rey Dau, the apex monster of the Windward Plains. As the game's entryway into its world, the Windward Plains contains monsters whose designs were carefully made to match the overall game experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Herds are one of the major concepts in Wilds, and so we created Doshaguma as a monster that lets players experience this element of the game,” says Tokuda. “We were designing Doshaguma from a pretty early stage, in part to help verify the way that packs move."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, Fujioka says, the design of Rey Dau, the boss of the Windward Plains, was finished before that of Arkveld, the marquee monster in Wilds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think part of a monster's character can be an appearance that simply makes you think that it looks cool, even among all the other unique monsters,” he says. “We call these our ‘handsome monsters’. We believe that if we're able to have one of these cool monsters appear at just the right time, they'll stand out that much more as a unique character. We thought that Rey Dau was in a good position for that even during the design stage, and so we wanted it to be a cool monster. As Rey Dau's design was finalized before Arkveld's, even some of our own staff thought that it was the game's main monster until partway through development. That's just how handsome it is." However, once Arkveld’s design was finalized the whole team was satisfied they had found their flagship monster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rey Dau is a monster that uses lightning, and it reigns over the Windward Plains as its apex monster. Tokuda explains that this background was used as a base for its attack patterns and movements.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Rey Dau's biggest attack is one where it stores lightning in its body and slides its face along the ground to unleash all of it at once,” he says. “As it grinds its wings into the sand, the lightning combines with it to create Fulgurite Ore. The amount of electricity it stores rises higher and higher when it wears these crystals, and it can store electricity faster as well. Thinking about this process is what caused it to become a monster notable for its wing-based physical attacks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka says that monster attacks are even a part of the game's stage design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we were designing this stage, we talked about incorporating the process of lightning generating Fulgurite Ore,” he says. “The terrain is formed by Fulgurite Ore created when lightning strikes the ground, and villagers use the ore to ward off monsters. We hope that players pay attention to how monster biology and attack methods are connected to how the game's humans live."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While it may sound simple for ore to be generated when lightning shot from a monster hits the sand, a number of technical hurdles awaited the team before they could make this a reality. Conditions like the timing of the lightning hitting the sand or the desert and its sloping hills had to be calculated in real-time to generate this ore, and creating that system was no simple task.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, Monster Hunter is a real-time, synchronous multiplayer game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The feeling of playing together and being able to communicate on the same wavelength with shared information is extremely important to us. Our top priority during development is how we express the experience of people playing in the same space," says Fujioka. I'm overwhelmed for a moment when I hear this. Yes, this may of course be what multiplayer game development theory states, but the hurdles presented to this team by what they're attempting to depict are far greater than players imagine.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, compromise was not an option when it came to depicting Rey Dau's actions when considering the earlier discussion about a world where monster ecology is directly tied to the lives of human characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Monster Hunter does depict a fantasy world, but we want players to feel a kind of reality from each individual thing they see in-game,” says Tokuda. “Graphics become higher-definition as hardware advances, and so we want the world's setting to be as authentic as possible, because this kind of reality is connected to the game's immersion." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These words make me feel how important the detailed creation of monsters is to Mr. Tokuda. The games depict their world through their monsters, and depict their monsters through their world. As this reciprocal relationship digs deeper and takes form, it completes the Monster Hunter experience.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Returning monsters</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Forbidden Lands act as this game's stage, so as a place unknown to hunters, the developers say that they included a higher proportion of new monsters at the start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among all of its monsters, the first familiar one that hunters encounter in the Forbidden Lands is Congalala. Its reappearance was a moment that shocked and delighted players. I had a chance to play the Scarlet Forest where it appears, and along with the story that involves the adorable Wudwuds who live in the Forest, it all made for a humorous sequence. Though a hunt is understood to be a serious task for players who've faced the harsh environments of the Forbidden Lands in the Windward Plains, this is still a moment on the lighthearted side.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Congalala was selected after an overall evaluation of the Scarlet Forest's ecosystem, comical twists and more. Still, Tokuda says that the dev team found ways in which it's a surprisingly good match even after their decision.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Congalala is a monster with straightforward action compared to the unique monsters of the Scarlet Forest that hunters will have faced so far, like Lala Barina,” he says. “It's easy to hit, and I think it ended up being perfectly placed for players to enjoy hunting as they make full use of what they've learned and the weapons they've created so far."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we have monsters appear, we're always conscious of not just trying to make them easy to understand for players new to Monster Hunter, but to also shock and delight fans of the series," Fujioka says, recalling the reaction fans had when they announced Congalala's return. "I think tossing Congalala out right there was just right for it. We announced it at Tokyo Game Show because we thought fans who know about Congalala would enjoy that. Once we did, the reaction ended up being even bigger than we imagined. We talked later about how that must have been the greatest moment of Congalala's life."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seeing these two as they say this makes me think that in a way, the Monster Hunter development team is also like a talent agency trying to sell its stars. Monster Hunter's monsters must feel as attractive and real as they do because of these creators who care about their monsters more than anything, searching for the place where they'll shine the brightest.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The sensei returns</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For longtime fans, the reappearance of Yian Kut-Ku was likely even more of a shock than Congalala's. As a sort of rite of passage that teaches players the movements and methods they need while being a bit strict at times and kind at others, Yian Kut-Ku is known to series fans as Sensei, or “teacher.” Despite being a beloved monster, though, it didn't reappear in the series for the longest time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yian Kut-Ku is a monster that many Monster Hunter lovers know, and we're aware that they call it Sensei, says Fujioka, clarifying the monster's positioning. “We designed it as a monster that teaches you the basics when facing large monsters."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's difficult to have Yian Kut-Ku act as a teacher, as that role is played in each game by different monsters that are suited for the environment of its new stages. The way that the fans love Yian Kut-Ku is important to these developers as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Yian Kut-Ku's name would always come up whenever discussing which monsters would appear in each game, it was difficult for it to make an appearance without something new that still felt right for it. Tokuda says that the herds in Wilds are part of what helped to support Sensei's reappearance. That's because Yian Kut-Ku was always related to packs of monsters, even if they couldn't be depicted in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yian Kut-Ku herds did exist in the game's setting, but we never had a chance to make that a part of the actual gameplay until now,” he says. “It seemed like a good fit for the systems of Wilds that let us include packs of monsters, and we were able to find a moment for it to appear in the perfect way during the game's progression."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What could he mean by "a perfect way"? I try asking more about Yian Kut-Ku's position in Wilds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"While Yian Kut-Ku is loved by many players right now, I think it was incredibly strong when it first appeared,” Tokuda elaborates. “It's placed at the moment in the game where the difficulty curve suddenly spikes upward, and we weren't sure that it'd be right to have it appear like that again to play the role of a teacher. That's why we thought we needed to do a deeper analysis of its strengths and what makes it feel strong. We looked at recent player trends and thought about the position they'd want Yian Kut-Ku to occupy instead of simply being a teacher, which is why we've prepared a different kind of position for it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a bit of a behind-the-scenes story about Yian Kut-Ku. Tokuda is a lover of large reptiles, and his pet lizard that's over a meter long has a major relationship to Yian Kut-Ku's design this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I made a garden that's like a miniature Ancient Forest for my lizards and even breed them there,” he says. “It's like there's vegetation inside of my home. I've made an ecosystem there, complete with water, light and wind. An artist who knew that I raise lizards told me to bring my largest lizard's shed skin, which we then scanned and processed in order to make it a part of Yian Kut-Ku's scales in the game."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monsters growing alongside fans</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yian Kut-Ku was able to make a comeback thanks to the passion players had for their Sensei and the herds system implemented in Wilds. So then, which monster's comeback is most awaited out of those that haven't made an appearance (yet) in Wilds?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That would have to be Lagiacrus," Tokuda instantly responds. "Ever since World, people ask us to bring Lagiacrus back no matter where in the world we go. It feels like we've been constantly asked since then."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka nods vigorously as he sits beside Tokuda. "There really are a lot of fans both inside and outside of Japan who love Monster Hunter Tri,” he says. “It's a very memorable title for me as well. Listening to the fans, I get the sense that monsters like Lagiacrus and Brachydios enjoy a particularly deep-rooted popularity. Gore Magala as well, as it seems like many people have a lasting love of monsters that are featured on the cover art of a title."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Tokuda says, Lagiacrus is a very memorable monster for both developers. The two were involved in its creation, with Fujioka as director during the development of Monster Hunter Tri and Tokuda as its lead planner of the monsters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm one of the creators of Lagiacrus myself, so I naturally have a deep attachment to it,” says Tokuda. “I might even say that I want to put it in the game more than anyone. There are a lot of difficulties, such as the fact that we haven't had aquatic battles or action ever since Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, of course… But we've heard everyone's voices loud and clear, and I want fans to know that I want it to make an appearance just as much as anyone."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hearing Tokuda talk, I get a sense of the deep affection and attachment to specific monsters that goes beyond the categories of developer or player, held instead by people who love Monster Hunter. The monsters lovingly created by the developers are loved by players, with those feelings then reaching the developers. Perhaps this is how monsters in Monster Hunter change and grow.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"When looking at Monster Hunter as a series, I've always felt a kind of strong passion that's created through communication,” says Fujioka. “The biggest characters that appear in Monster Hunter are its monsters, at the end of the day. It's about how fans see those monsters, and that understanding is what creates the next step for Monster Hunter. That's why I think that carefully fostering the feeling of monsters as characters is key to Monster Hunter." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I ask about one more thing that's been on my mind: Rathalos, a monster that could be called a series mainstay. Rathalos' appearance in Wilds has already been revealed in a trailer, but how will it appear to us this time around? I ask, but Fujioka steadfastly keeps everything from the way it makes an appearance to its environment a secret. But what he does give me is a small glimpse at his feelings towards it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Rath is the poster monster for the series, so we're still keeping that a secret for now,” he says. “I feel like Rath is the kind of monster that makes both the creators and the players think, 'Yep, this is Monster Hunter' when it appears. That's why we always give a lot of thought about how it'll show up impactfully whenever we develop a new title.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"During World, there were a lot of people around the globe who still didn't know about Monster Hunter, and so we depicted Rath as the apex monster of the Ancient Forest's ecosphere, the game's first stage. But now that there are so many people who know about it through World, we've thought about how to place it in a position that they'd find interesting." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Depicting monsters means depicting the world of Monster Hunter. Contemplating the role of a monster means creating the experience hunters will have. Monsters are present at every point of the gameplay loop, and their creators truly care about them. It won't be long until we get to meet new ones and be reunited with old favorites in Wilds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of old favorites, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-the-monster-hunter-wilds-team-select-their-beastly-lineup-ign-first">Gravios has been revealed as a returning monster in Monster Hunter Wilds.</a> Check out our exclusive Gravios reveal, which includes details straight from the devs and brand-new gameplay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds comes to PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on February 28.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-burning-questions-price-release-size-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After months of being easily the worst-kept secret in the gaming industry, the Nintendo Switch 2 has finally been revealed. We’ve now gotten <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name">our first official look at the new console</a> via a trailer from Nintendo, one that confirms many of the leaks that had surfaced about the successor to the original Nintendo Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this new footage proved to be tantalizingly brief, and there’s a lot we still don’t know about the Nintendo Switch 2. When is the exact release date? How much will it cost? Why isn’t it backwards-compatible with every original Switch game? Let’s break down the biggest questions surrounding the new console as we wait for the next Nintendo Direct in April 2025. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 - First Look</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">What's the Nintendo Switch 2 Release Date?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s been plenty of speculation about when in 2025 Nintendo plans on releasing the Switch 2. The trailer gives us no new insight on that subject, only confirming what we already knew - the system will hit stores at some point this year. So when in 2025 is the Switch 2 actually dropping?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Switch launched on March 3, 2017, after first being revealed in October 2016. Will Nintendo follow a similar timetable this time around? If so, that would <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-likely-not-before-june"><u>put the release of the Switch 2 around May or June 2025</u></a>, which is in line with recent rumors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At this point, all we know for sure is that the system won’t release before April 2025. Nintendo has scheduled a new Direct livestream on April 2, where we’ll get more details about the console and see footage of the Switch 2’s launch games. We also know that Nintendo will be running a series of hands-on fan preview events from April until early June. It would make sense to release the console once those events have concluded. But again, we probably won’t get a firm release date until the Direct in April.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is the Price of the Switch 2?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The price tag might be the biggest mystery surrounding the Nintendo Switch 2 at the moment. How much will the new console cost? Will it be in line with the original Switch, or should gamers brace themselves for a price hike?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Switch launched in 2017 at $300. Currently, the Switch OLED is priced at $350. With the Switch 2 being, by all appearances, an upgraded version of the Switch with superior hardware, it stands to reason that Nintendo will increase the price by $50 or $100. Indeed current rumors suggest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-predicted-to-arrive-in-2024-at-less-than-400"><u>the Switch 2 will launch at $400</u></a>, putting it in line with the baseline OLED Steam Deck. IGN spoke with a number of industry analysts who largely agree that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-cost-analysts-weigh-in"><u>$400 is the sweet spot for the new console</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may ultimately depend on how advanced the hardware is in the new console. Rumors suggest the Switch 2 is roughly on par with the Xbox One X. In other words, a major upgrade over its predecessor, but not necessarily on the cutting edge of portable tech. The horsepower of the Switch 2 and questions like whether the system still uses an OLED screen (more on that later), will determine just how much more expensive the Switch 2 is compared to the original.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What New Games Will the Switch 2 Launch With?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A new console is only as good as its library of launch games. Part of the reason the original Switch was such a hit out of the gate is that it launched with a pretty killer lineup. It’s not often that a new Nintendo console launches with a brand-new, open-world Legend of Zelda game. Couple that with the hugely popular Mario Kart 8 and the release of Super Mario Odyssey later that same year, and it’s clear the Switch came out with guns blazing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will the Switch 2 have a similarly impressive arsenal? At this point, we can only really speculate. The trailer only teases one new game for the Switch 2, offering <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-new-mario-kart-game-is-seemingly-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2"><u>footage of what we assume is Mario Kart 9</u></a>. If Nintendo has a new Zelda or Mario game planned for launch, they’re keeping that under wraps until April.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We do have a fairly comprehensive list of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/predicting-the-switch-2-launch-games"><u>all the games rumored to launch with the Nintendo Switch 2</u></a>. We’re expecting an upswell of third party support this time around, now that there won’t be such a wide gulf in technical power between Nintendo’s console and the Playstation 5 and Xbox.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is the Switch 2’s Exact Size?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest takeaways from the Switch 2 trailer is that the new console isn’t just more powerful than its predecessor, but bigger, too. Both the console itself and the Joy-Cons are physically taller (though their width appears unchanged) and the screen is larger and takes up more of the front of the unit. All signs point to this being a more substantial piece of hardware than the original Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But just how big is the Switch 2? Based on the trailer, we’d estimate the Switch 2 is around 15% larger than the original. Is that accurate? How much of a difference does that make to the overall experience? Will the new Switch be as comfortable to hold and manipulate? Again, we’ll have to wait until April for more concrete details.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Type of Screen Does It Have?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Switch only went through one major hardware refresh during its long life cycle, but it was a big upgrade. The Switch OLED is a clear improvement over the original model. The OLED screen is brighter and more vibrant, and the OLED tech also allows for improved battery life (a big win on a portable system like this). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, Nintendo fans have been wondering whether the Switch 2 will follow that example and once again make use of an OLED display. We’d certainly like to see an OLED panel again, but it’s very possible Nintendo will downgrade to an LED or even LCD panel in order to keep costs down. The trailer gives us no indication of what tech the Switch 2 is using, so this is another area where we’ll have to wait until the next Nintendo Direct to find out more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Which Games Aren’t Backwards Compatible?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo eased fears by confirming that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-officially-almost-fully-backward-compatible"><u>the Switch 2 will be backwards-compatible with most original Switch games</u></a>. These OG Switch games, whether physical cartridges or digital downloads, will work on the new system. That makes it that much easier to commit to the new console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, the trailer does include a disclaimer that not all Switch games will be compatible with the new console. Which games won’t work on the new system? Are we talking about Switch games that require the original Joy-Con controller, like Ring Fit Adventure or Nintendo LABO? Or are there other hardware limitations we don’t know about that will prevent certain games from coming forward to the new system?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Will Original Switch Games Be Enhanced?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s good to know that most original Switch games will work on the new console. Still, that leaves the question of how exactly Switch games will perform on the Switch 2. Will the experience be identical, or will Nintendo make use of the upgraded hardware to boost framerates and otherwise improve the graphics?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given how much graphically intensive games like Tears of the Kingdom are crying out for more horsepower, we have to assume Nintendo has some sort of plan for offering improved versions of original Switch games. But will it be as simple as loading up an old Switch cart on the Switch 2, or will gamers have to pay for an upgraded, remastered version? And if it’s the latter, will that take the form of a paid download, or will they have to buy a completely new version of the game? Basically, what investment are we looking at if we want to play a Tears of the Kingdom remaster? </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What New Functions Does the Joy-Con Have?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Rumors suggested the new Joy-Con controllers would be getting a few upgrades on the Switch 2. Those rumors were borne out by the trailer, which confirms that the new Joy-Con has an extra button and will attach to the console magnetically rather than via rails. The trailer even seems to confirm the rumor that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-mouse-theory-is-looking-pretty-good-right-about-now"><u>the Joy-Con can be manipulated like a computer mouse</u></a>, opening up new gameplay opportunities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How exactly will the Switch 2 take advantage of these new features? Will the mouse-style functionality open up new doors for first-person shooters or strategy games on the Switch 2? And what exactly does the new button do?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, we expect the new Joy-Con will be a major focus at the Direct event in April, where we’ll see new games that show off the opportunities provided by these added features.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Kart 9 - First Look</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Will Joy-Con Drift Be Fixed?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gaming on the original Switch wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. Many owners faced the dreaded problem of Joy-Con drift, where joysticks would begin to register movement on their own. While to their credit, Nintendo was aggressive about offering repair and replacement solutions, it was still a frustrating problem that persisted throughout the Switch life cycle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We can only hope drift is an issue Nintendo has solved this time around. Are the new Joy-Cons drift-proof? Will the combination of new joystick sensors and the magnetic attachments ensure that this problem is a thing of the past? We hope so, but we’ll see whether Nintendo addresses the subject at the Direct event in April. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on the Nintendo Switch 2, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/30-details-from-the-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-trailer">30 details we found in the reveal trailer</a>, and see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-nintendo-in-2025">what to expect from Nintendo in 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.
