            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-2-black-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a moment near the end of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black where you retrace the original Ninja Gaiden’s opening level in reverse. I know that level like the back of my hand, having played it over and over and over again two decades ago on a demo disk until I could beat Murai, the first boss, without getting hit. And though you aren’t forced to go all the way to the beginning of that first stage here, this area isn't what it used to be. It’s dilapidated, rotting, falling apart; you can see the damage caused by time and the events of the first game clearly. Ninja Gaiden 2 Black never directly comments on this; Ryu doesn’t mention it, and the camera never pulls any tricks to call attention to it. It’s a moment of subtlety that's very un-Ninja Gaiden, but as I ran back through these familiar stomping grounds, I had an enormous smile on my face. Like this remake as a whole, it may not quite be what it once was, but slicing and dicing my way through it feels as good as ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That moment is a good summary of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, an Unreal Engine 5-powered remake of 2008's Ninja Gaiden 2, one of the Xbox 360 era’s definitive action games. Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is, according to Team Ninja, supposed to be the definitive edition of Ninja Gaiden 2, combining a stunning visual upgrade with several balance changes. Unfortunately, as good as 2 Black is – and let me state without equivocation this is a remarkable visual upgrade to an already excellent action game – it is not the end-all, be-all edition of Ninja Gaiden 2 that the Black moniker implies. Like many of the weapons Ryu wields, 2 Black is something of a double-edged sword. Its changes cut both ways.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But before we dig into what 2 Black isn't, let's talk about what it is. This is what I like to call an Action Jackson: a 3D beat-em-up with a hyperintense focus on combat above all else. Like previous versions, 2 Black takes place a year after the Xbox reboot of Ninja Gaiden. This time, the Black Spider Ninja Clan and Greater Fiends have formed an alliance to resurrect the Archfiend, and Dragon Ninja and ultimate badass Ryu Hayabusa is the only one who can stop them (though he does get a little help from his friends and the CIA). The story is more an excuse for you to travel the world, meet exciting and interesting monstrosities, ninjas, and Fiends, and turn them into limbless torsos than it is a fleshed-out narrative. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, I forgot how <em>funny</em> it is. Greater Fiends voiced by Steve Blum quote Shakespeare at you! You fight a lightning man on the Statue of Liberty! A giant, four-armed werewolf named Volf brings you to the colosseum in Venice, which is full of more werewolves, for a duel to the death, and he's like "do you want him to die?" and all the werewolves cheer, and then he's like "who do you want to kill him?" and then all the werewolves are like "Volf!" and he's like "Yes! I, Volf, will kill him!" and so you're just fighting a giant four-armed werewolf in the colosseum while a bunch of werewolves are cheering him on. This, folks, is the best camp this side of the river.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even by genre standards, Ryu Hayabusa is a walking arsenal.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But you’re not here for that. You're here for the combat, and on that front, 2 Black delivers and then some. Ninja Gaiden 2's whole deal is that you can delimb enemies, cutting off arms, legs, and even heads as you rip through rooms, opening up anyone who is suddenly short a body part for an instant execution if they're still up and walking (or crawling) around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The downside is that enemies that are injured are even more dangerous. These dudes will jump on you, stab you, and blow themselves up to kill you. Unlike Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, Ninja Gaiden is not about styling on your enemies. It is about <em>surviving</em>. Your foes will not stand there and wait for you to attack them, nor will they do long, slow attacks with a noticeable windup. No, these dudes are fast, ferocious, and unrelenting, and they think you kicked their dog and are pretty sure you said something about their momma. They want you <em>dead.</em> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing is, they’re up against Ryu Hayabusa. Ryu isn't your typical Action Jackson protag; the dude, even by genre standards, is a walking arsenal. By the end of the roughly 10-hour campaign, you're going to be walking around with no less than nine melee weapons, three ranged weapons, and four different flavors of fancy Ninja magic (Ninpo), and each melee weapon has a unique moveset with combos to learn and special techniques to master. You haven’t lived until you’ve decapitated someone with a Flying Swallow, used the Lunar Staff or Vigoorian Flail to combo half a dozen enemies at once, or pulled off the almighty Izuna Drop to slam a dude's head into the ground so hard that it explodes.</p><div id="rank-the-ninja-gaiden-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank the Ninja Gaiden games</h3><h3>Rank the Ninja Gaiden games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ryu feels like a character from a fighting game. He has a complex moveset and combos to learn, the ability to block attacks and then sidestep or dodge backward, special moves and magic, and a unique counter-attack ability specific to each weapon that allows him to transition from defense to offense in the blink of an eye. Oh, and he's a Ninja, so he can do stuff like run up walls and leap down for a powerful blow, jump on his enemy’s heads, and leap forward and hurl them across the screen by the neck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In recent years, action games have leaned heavily on parries and invincibility-frames to get you out of trouble, but that's not how 2 Black operates. Ryu has excellent defensive tools, but Ninja Gaiden is about positioning, aggression, and mastery of both your weapons and slew of techniques. You are always moving, always looking for an opportunity to go on the offensive, and always prioritizing the biggest threat, whether it’s an injured enemy who might try to grab you, a caster hanging back to pepper you with spells, or an enormous werewolf looking to tear your face off and eat it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is a symphony of death and you are the conductor.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At its best, this is a symphony of death and you're the conductor, chaining together combos, dodging and counter-attacking, and using the Essence dropped by enemies to immediately charge your Ultimate Techniques, which are attacks so powerful that they can slice and dice an entire room. Ryu is always the coolest guy on screen, and when you’re cooking, the enemies throwing themselves at you to die give off that “surely I will be the guy that kills John Wick” vibe. When you’re not, you can die very, very quickly. You’re going to get good, or you're not going to progress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not as unforgiving as it sounds. Save statues restore your entire health bars the first time you use them, and most of your life (minus a red section that grows over time as you take damage) is restored once you finish any given encounter. Even then, you've got items to fix that red section, heal you in a pinch mid-combat, and if all else fails, you can always kill more enemies and pray for blue Essence that will restore health. It’s never over until it's over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it's a flawless combat system, right? Well… not quite. Just like in the original, the camera can be a little janky and get stuck in weird places from time to time. It's not too bad if you’re proactive about managing it and smart about how you approach fights, though it can have issues with tight corners and you will get hit off-screen every now and then. It’s an annoyance, but a minor one.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other major problem is the quality of the boss encounters. Some of them like Volf are challenging, memorable, fun, or a combination of the three. But then there’s fights like the Water Dragon, a weird worm thing in the subway, or the Nuclear Armadillo (yes, really). And those… well, those kinda suck. Not because they’re hard, necessarily, but because they’re just plain not engaging to fight, force you to play in ways that zap the fun from Ninja Gaiden 2's combat system, or rely on some weird gimmick. Even some of the best fights can overstay their welcome with repeated re-runs. I mean, I love the Genshin fight, but did I really need to do it <em>four times</em>, especially when it doesn't change much during the rematches? How many times do I need to teach you this lesson, old man?!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between fights, you'll get to explore each level, which are linear but still reward heading off the beaten path with health bonuses, Ninpo upgrades, Essence, and Crystal Skulls (Why was 2008 the year of the crystal skull?) that provide discounts at the shop. It’s here, in the stages themselves, that you see the depth of 2 Black’s visual upgrades. Yeah, the new character models look amazing (love the new hair, Sonia), but the lighting changes and texture upgrades really make these environments pop. Ninja Gaiden 2 has always been gorgeous, but it’s easy to forget how ambitious it was. These levels are <em>huge</em>, and occasional camera issues aside, the platforming sections are largely really enjoyable and provide some nice variety between combat encounters. I particularly like the one in the clock tower – running up walls and doing bird flips is fun! Who knew?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The stages are where you can best see the visual upgrades.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So overall, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is pretty great. If anything, though, its biggest flaw is that it's based more on the 2009 PlayStation 3 port Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 than it is the original 360 version. This is a little inside baseball, but bear with me for a second: For those who don't know, Ninja Gaiden 2 and Sigma 2 are very, <em>very </em>different. I'm not going to go into extreme depth here because there’s too much to list, but Sigma 2 added or removed certain bosses, costumes, and weapons, reworked levels, changed how weapon upgrades work, and even added three new characters (Rachel, Momiji, and Ayane) with their own story chapters. It’s… a lot. So much so that Team Ninja has even crafted <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng2black/us/comparison/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a handy dandy comparison table</u></a> listing what's in all the different versions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The differences I really want to highlight, though, are the changes to enemy density and health, as they have the single biggest impact on how 2 Black actually plays. Compared to the original, Sigma 2 substantially reduced the number of enemies on-screen at once. There are dozens of enemies on iconic sections like The Stairs in the original release, so many that it could actually force the framerate into the single digits on Xbox 360. In 2 Black, you might get eight or so on screen at once in the same sequence. In exchange for sheer numbers, enemies in Sigma 2 (and thus, 2 Black) get more health and take longer to delimb, but are less aggressive. Even a Ninja Dog could tell you that these changes make combat worse. Environments are often empty and enemies feel spongy. Certain enemies, especially bigger ones like werewolves or the gargoyle-esque Van Gelfs (which are already immune to staple attacks like the Izuna Drop) take much, much longer to delimb and kill, making combat encounters with a lot of them drag.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Action Games</h3><p>Rise of the Ronin is Team Ninja's latest foray into the action genre. Here's how it stacks up against my favorites.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I played 2 Black on the Path of the Acolyte difficulty (Normal) for this review because I figured it is what most people will play, though this was considered Easy in the original 360 release. After finishing it, I fired up the original Ninja Gaiden II on my Xbox Series X and played for a while on Path of the Warrior, which 2 Black lists as Hard and the original lists as Normal. Even on a higher difficulty, enemies died more quickly – I could often delimb or outright kill individual ninjas with a single attack from the Dragon Sword when it might take a full combo to do so in 2 Black – and it was exciting to fight more enemies on-screen at a time. Ninja Gaiden 2 just feels <em>faster</em> and <em>better</em> than Ninja Gaiden 2 Black. Ryu even seems to move through the environments more quickly, and it's more exciting to play as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2 Black's issues don't stop there. The combat changes from Sigma 2 also mean that enemies will sometimes block attacks in a combo after being hit or fall out of a combo mid-string. While this inconsistency does <em>technically</em> make 2 Black more like its predecessor, 2's combat system isn't built for it the way Ninja Gaiden Black’s is and it feels <em>bad</em> every time it happens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, however, 2 Black does do a lot right in addition to the visual upgrade. The higher level of gore from the original release is back, as is the weapon upgrade system. Sigma 2 just gives you free upgrades at certain points; in 2 Black and the original, you can buy upgrades at any shop with Essence, which you also spend on healing items. I challenged myself to play through 2 Black without using any healing or Ninpo restoration items unless I found one when I was already full up, so this didn't affect me a ton, but having upgrades cost Essence again is a good change because it forces you to choose between saving it to boost your weapons or spending it on items that will help you stay alive. Even intro screens before each mission resemble the more appealing ones from the original release more than Sigma 2. These things may feel minor, but they matter.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Enemies are spongier than in the original, but less than in Sigma 2.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">2 Black also smartly removes the not-great Giant Buddha Statue and Statue of Liberty (yes, really) boss fights that Sigma 2 added while retaining good additions like the Dark Dragon. And while enemies are still spongier than in the original, they do at least feel less spongy than Sigma 2 and there seem to be more of them. Still not quite as many as in the original, though without playing all three games back to back to back and counting corpses, it’s impossible to say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the good stuff from Sigma 2 is still here. I like the new levels with Rachel, Momiji, and Ayane. None of these characters have Ryu's expansive kit, so there isn’t as much depth to them, but they all feel unique and are fun to play as, especially in one-off chapters. This is still Ninja Gaiden, so they still look Like That (Ayane's costume is particularly silly), but 2 Black never treats them as anything less than Extremely Competent Action Girls and they're a nice change of pace, even if the transition from Ryu to them occasionally feels jarring from a story perspective.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finishing the campaign unlocks additional costumes for every character (though not as many as in Sigma 2, and even some of the costumes from the original are not present), which is neat. You’ll also open up Chapter Challenges if you wanna replay chapters and compete for a high score, though there aren't online leaderboards, and 2 Black does not bring back the original's New Game Plus mode. There’s the Formerly Co-op With Another Real Person But Now Only With an NPC Friend Tag Team Missions, too, if you’re looking for more to do, which is nice. And I also appreciate the return of Sigma 2's Hero difficulty, which is great for folks new to action games or who might need additional accessibility options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If I have one other complaint with 2 Black, it's that there are bugs here and there. It crashed on me once, had a few texture bugs in extremely funny places like The Stairs (if you know, you know), and once a door with some enemies (and goodies) behind it failed to open. The latter was, admittedly, really funny: I just heard rocket ninjas shooting at me from inside a train as I furiously tried to get in and kill them and they furiously tried to get out and kill me, but it did mean I had to restart from my last checkpoint to fix it.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is neither Ninja Gaiden 2 nor Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, but instead a secret third thing that mixes both versions together to create something that is wholly unique and by far the most beautiful version of this excellent action game yet. While I have a hard time calling it the definitive release because I prefer the original’s “more dudes who are more aggressive but die faster” approach, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is a definite improvement over the Sigma 2 release, fixes several long-standing issues, and unlike the original, isn’t trapped on the Xbox 360. It isn't the version I was hoping for (get on it, modders), but it is still an incredible game and I'm happy it exists. If this really is it for Ninja Gaiden 2, it will at least go out on a high note. This trip through time reminded me that while you can't go home again, and nothing will ever truly be like it was, that doesn't mean something can't still be beautiful. Ninja Gaiden 2 is remarkable, even with its flaws, and it's good to finally have it back in Black.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The project is said to be in early development and is expected to keep the video game experience’s non-linear narrative in mind as work progresses. Additional details, including casting information and release plans, have yet to be revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Page told Deadline that filming Beyond: Two Souls was “one of the most challenging and fulfilling acting experiences” of his career.

Directed and written by Quantic Dream’s David Cage, it follows the story of Jodie Holmes, a girl with psychic powers that allow her to communicate with a spirit she calls Aiden. Aside from the non-linear narrative that explores different sections of her life, the game was known for its inclusion of big-name actors like Page and Willem Dafoe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cage said he is collaborating with Page on the Beyond: Two Souls TV show, though the extent of his involvement is unclear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are absolutely thrilled to collaborate again with Elliot Page on this project,” Cage said. “I was blown away by his acting performance in the game, and I couldn’t think of anyone else to tell this story with the same passion on another medium.<em> Beyond: Two Souls </em>is a very special game for millions of players around the world who were moved by the story of Jodie and Aiden, and their journey in life and beyond.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Mass Effect to be led by team of series veterans.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has announced it is restructuring Dragon Age and Mass Effect studio BioWare, moving a number of developers onto other projects within EA and focusing entirely on its upcoming Mass Effect game going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> from general manager Gary McKay, he wrote that the studio is "taking this opportunity between full development cycles to reimagine how we work at BioWare."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Given this stage of development, we don’t require support from the full studio," he continues. "We have incredible talent here at BioWare, and so we have worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN understands that EA has already placed an unknown number of developers from BioWare into other, equivalent roles within the company. A smaller number of Dragon Age team members are also seeing their roles terminated, and are being offered time to apply to other roles within the company if they so choose.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioWare's structure has shifted repeatedly in recent years. The studio had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs">a round of layoffs in 2023</a>., and has seen a number of high-profile departures throughout the development of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the most recent of which was<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-reportedly-exits-bioware"> director Corinne Busche</a> announcing her departure from the studio last week. It is unclear how many individuals work at BioWare today. IGN asked EA for any comment or specifics on how many individuals at BioWare are being impacted by this change, how many are facing potential layoffs, and how many will remain at the studio. EA did not provide the specifics, but a spokesperson offered the following comment:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The studio's priority was Dragon Age. During this time there were people continuing to build the vision for the next Mass Effect. Now that The Veilguard has shipped, the studio's full focus is Mass Effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While we're not sharing numbers, the studio has the right number of people in the right roles to work on Mass Effect at this stage of development."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Mass Effect in question was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-new-mass-effect-project-is-in-development-at-bioware-with-a-veteran-team">announced four years ago</a>, and is still in the early stages of development. IGN understands that BioWare's current strategy is to prioritize one game at a time, as some developers who had been working on Mass Effect were previously moved to Dragon Age to get the project over the finish line and are now moving back. Per the blog post, Mass Effect development is now being led by series veterans including Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts, and Parrish Ley.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This news comes a week after EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-15-million-players-in-first-two-months-ea-expected-3-million">announced that Dragon Age: The Veilguard missed its player targets</a> by nearly 50% and reduced its guidance for the fiscal year due to this and, more impactfully, weaker-than-expected results from EA Sports FC 25. The company will hold its Q3 earnings conference call on February 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rift-of-the-necrodancer-review.1095183/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/rift-of-the-necrodancer-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Departing from developer Brace Yourself Games’ usual dungeon crawling discotheques, Rift of the NecroDancer is a more traditional rhythm game that innovates on some of the genre’s best ideas. With a foot-tappingly entrancing soundtrack from a team of talented composers and musicians, its creative riffs on stalwart rhythm game modes from classics like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/25/guitar-hero-live-review"><u>Guitar Hero</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/03/31/rhythm-heaven-review"><u>Rhythm Heaven</u></a> — as well as loads of cool extras — make it a sort of “Greatest Hits” box set for rhythm games as a whole. Even when it occasionally goes off-tempo, I regularly had a hard time putting Rift of the NecroDancer down as I squashed slimes and skeletons while bobbing my head along to its pulsing beats, always striving towards a better score.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before you can even start fighting monsters, Rift of the NecroDancer gives you all the tools you need to succeed. First, it tests your setup to determine your video and audio delay so you don’t fall victim to the possible milliseconds of pause between your headphones, inputs, or certain displays that could make or break a high score attempt. This level of accommodation goes a long way toward removing unnecessary barriers to entry, and makes it clear that your success will always be determined by your own ability rather than seemingly arbitrary variables beyond your control such as input lag. It’s a subtle touch that I really appreciated as I switched between devices, displays, and audio outputs.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Right of the NecroDancer Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After a brief tutorial, you can then either run wild in Rift of the NecroDancer’s 35-song tracklist or hop into a brief story campaign that sees series protagonist Cadence and her friends transported from the world of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/21/crypt-of-the-necrodancer-review"><u>Crypt of the NecroDancer</u></a> into one resembling our own. This makes for some cheeky fish-out-of-water moments about reckoning with how a person from a fantasy world would react to the woes of day-to-day modern life, but it mostly just serves as a vehicle for Rift of the NecroDancer’s main mode, Rhythm Rifts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rhythm Rifts will look familiar to anyone who has shouldered stringless, plastic guitars to rock out to licensed music in Guitar Hero: enemies (which replace color-coded notes) come down three lanes, each linked to a directional input. Every beat of the current song brings them one step further down their lane, and when they line up with a marker at the bottom, you need to press a button in the corresponding direction to squash them in their tracks. It’s a simple but effective and, engaging setup.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This clever marriage of ideas brings some fun evolution to well-worn territory.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the notes in rhythm games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/05/rock-band-4-review"><u>Rock Band</u></a>, however, most monsters don’t just sit and wait for their turn on the way down to you. From the Red Harpy, who rushes you down quickly but folds in one hit, to the Black Skeleton, which takes two hits before running back up the lane to go down again, Rhythm Rifts aren’t only about hitting the right button on the beat. Instead, Rift of the NecroDancer keeps you on your toes by throwing legions of varied enemy types at you. It makes each song take on an almost bullet-hell-like feeling as you do your best to keep bad guys from getting past you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This clever marriage of Crypt of the NecroDancer’s monster-bashing roots with Guitar Hero’s tried-and-true formula brings some fun evolution to well-worn territory. Mix in challenging surprises, like traps that alter how some monsters attack or move, and Rift of the NecroDancer will keep you in that idyllic intensity between a blissful, glazed-eye flow and frantically trying to regain your footing as you get beaten down by the beat. And if you do find yourself swimming in monsters, you’ll eventually get knocked out and need to try the song over again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cadence can take up to 10 consecutive hits before she loses, but most songs will feed you healing items in the form of food to help keep you in the fight for longer. And once you hit a long enough combo streak, you can also fill up a meter to activate Vibe Power, which makes Cadence invincible for a brief period. It’s a helpful get-out-of-jail-free option if you need to keep your head above water during a tough riff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all! Rift of the NecroDancer also features minigames that feel ripped right out of Rhythm Heaven, down to their cute art style and cheeky animations, which offer fun, less involved diversions from the intense Rhythm Rifts. Each situated at some point within the roughly 5-hour story mode, these minigames range from hitting yoga poses with Crypt of the NecroDancer’s playable pacificist Dove, to helping out The NecroDancer himself during a lunch rush at his fast food day job. And just like the Rhythm Rifts, all five of these minigames have extra objectives to grind for, giving them some decent replayability, though the limited selection and simpler gameplay compared to Rhythm Rifts meant I didn’t ultimately spend as much time with them. My favorite has to be this funny-looking minigame where Cadence dresses up as a giant mole for a children’s TV show and has to dance to a rap about moles. It’s certainly goofy, but that song rips.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Boss fights are super well-animated and boast some great tracks.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the course of the story, you’ll also take on a handful of boss battles. These stages nicely shake things up again, kind of resembling a paired-back version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/08/10/osu-tatakae-ouendan"><u>Osu!</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/01/elite-beat-agents-review"><u>Elite Beat Agents</u></a> with a little bit of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/05/15/punch-out-review"><u>Punch-Out!</u></a> thrown in for good measure. Circles will pop up in various parts of the screen with a ring closing in around each, requiring you to press a specific corresponding button just as the ring touches the outside of the circle. Purple buttons have you dodging a boss’ attack, while gold ones are opportunities for Cadence to strike back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These fights are super well-animated and universally boast some great tracks that are worth the price of admission already, but the actual action offers something distinct enough from the other two modes to bring me back on its own. That’s partially because score and rank here are based on how quickly you can take down your foe. Perfect hits are still as crucial here as ever, but they’re a little easier to land, moving success away from timing alone. Instead, these boss fights put a focus on pattern recognition, with each boss having specific cycles that can make it easier or harder to win a fight quickly depending on how and when you strike.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This unexpected mash-up of styles represents exactly what makes Rift of the NecroDancer such a great sampler platter of rhythm game modes that still consistently innovates on what’s already been done. Taking a wider scope pays dividends by giving you more to choose from – for something chill and casual, ry out a minigame; For a more conventionally intense, arcade-like experience, try to best your scores in Rhythm Rifts; Or, if you want something a bit more out there, the boss battles provide a different enough flow. I liked jumping between them all, but the more classic Rhythm Rifts were definitely my favorite, and I’ve lost a lot of sleep chasing down high scores with a vengeance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I really enjoyed this pick-and-choose smorgasbord of different options, but this wide focus does trade in the laser-focused, album-like nature of previous NecroDancer games for the piecemeal scope of a “Greatest Hits” box set. Although each song is masterfully composed and designed into compelling, memorable fights, Rift of the NecroDancer as a full package is missing a sense of cohesion at times, prioritizing a wide berth of ideas and choices rather than one singularly sharpened direction.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Rift is positively packed with cool features and extras.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Again mimicking box sets and best-of compilations, it is positively packed with cool features and extras to dive into. Each song has a special challenge attached to it, ranging from only counting perfect notes toward your score to sudden death challenges that give you only one HP. And if you’ve already mastered one of your favorite songs but want to keep trying for a higher score, each track has a remixed version with different monster and attack patterns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if that still wasn’t enough for you, Rift of the NecroDancer’s community has already created a handful of custom songs in the Steam Workshop for you to download, play, and master. It’s so cool to see such in-depth support for a game like this at launch, and it’s been fun to dive into fanmade takes on other video game bangers like Megalovania from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/18/undertale-review"><u>Undertale</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Rift of the NecroDancer’s baked-in songs are incredible on their own. Series composer Danny Baranowsky and talented composers/VGM YouTubers like Jules Conroy (aka Familyjules) and Alex Moulaka have delivered an exceptional soundtrack. Without it, everything else would fall apart, no matter how enthralling the design. My favorite tracks were the bluesy homage to Chess Records called King’s Ruse and Progenitor, a metal ballad that remixes Crypt of the NecroDancer’s theme. As the beating heart of Rift of the NecroDancer, this soundtrack delivers diverse, catchy tunes that gave me a reason to feverishly grind for a better score as I bobbed my head to the beat whether I was squashing monsters, fighting bosses, or doing yoga.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
