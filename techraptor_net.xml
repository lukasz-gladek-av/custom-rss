            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Spike Chunsoft has announced that upcoming visual novel remake&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>will be making its way to the West in 2026, and the company has shown off some of the changes coming to the revamped version of the classic game as well.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.spike-chunsoft.com/news/sgr_title_announcement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on its official website, Spike Chunsoft says that a North American and European release of&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>is on the cards for next year, although the publisher stops short of announcing a specific month.</p>

<p>The game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steins-gate-reboot-2025" rel="nofollow">originally announced last year</a>, will serve as an enhanced remake of&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate</em>, a visual novel that made its debut on the Xbox 360 all the way back in 2009. It'll feature "updated visuals and new narrative content", according to Spike Chunsoft.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to brand new background art that aims to stay faithful to the way the game's Akihabara setting would have looked in 2010, "created using extensive reference materials", according to Spike Chunsoft.</p>

<p>New locations have been added to&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>in order to "complement and enrich the story", and new scenes have been added to "further a sense of immersion". Event stills have been reworked from the game's original storyboards to "deliver greater dramatic impact".</p>

<p>As well as all of the above,&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate Re:Boot&nbsp;</em>will also boast a reworked UI that should make navigating the game a little easier. All told, it sounds like Mages and Spike Chunsoft are angling to make this the definitive version of&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate</em>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/opus-prism-peak-delayed-march-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/opus-prism-peak-delayed-to-march-2026.1359634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Sigono and publisher Shueisha Games have announced that upcoming narrative adventure game&nbsp;<em>Opus: Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>has been delayed once again, but at least we now know in which month it'll be launching next year.</p>

<p>Per a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1947910/view/585033008523771918" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Opus: Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>will now be arriving in March 2026. It was originally slated for a 2025 release, but Sigono says that more time is needed to ensure the game "reaches the level of quality [the studio is] aiming for".</p>

<p>Sigono says the extra development time will allow it to polish the game further and ensure it's in a fit state for launch. It's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paralives-delayed-may-2026" rel="nofollow">pretty standard reason</a> for games to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">delayed</a>, but hey - what's that oft-misattributed quote about delayed games and rushed games, again?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/opus-prism-peak-delayed-2026-eugene.jpg?itok=SMntnFaH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/opus-prism-peak-delayed-2026-eugene.jpg?itok=q91snEYu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Opus: Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>has been delayed again, but it's got a new release window, at least.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Opus: Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>is the latest title in Sigono's&nbsp;<em>Opus&nbsp;</em>series of narrative adventure games, which began in 2016 with&nbsp;<em>Opus: The Day We Found Earth</em>, followed by 2018's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/opus-rocket-of-whispers-cleared-for-takeoff-on-switch-22nd-march" rel="nofollow">Rocket of Whispers</a>&nbsp;</em>and 2021's&nbsp;<em>Echo of Starsong</em>.</p>

<p>The games are loosely connected to one another by theme and atmosphere, but they don't tell a continuous story, so you won't need to have played previous&nbsp;<em>Opus&nbsp;</em>games to get the most out of&nbsp;<em>Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>when it eventually arrives.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Opus: Prism Peak</em>, you'll play as a photographer stranded in a place known as the Dusklands alongside a mysterious young girl who's lost her memories. As you find your way home, you'll uncover the mysteries of the Dusklands and of your companion as well.</p>

<p>Like previous&nbsp;<em>Opus&nbsp;</em>entries, you shouldn't expect high-octane action from this one; it'll be a contemplative narrative-led experience with an emphasis on photography, dialogue, and exploration.</p>




<p><em>Opus: Prism Peak&nbsp;</em>is set to launch across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1947910/OPUS_Prism_Peak/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, Switch 2, and Switch in March next year. You can try out a demo for the game on Steam right now if you want to get a feel for what it'll be like.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-iii-immortal-empires-free-first-two</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/total-war-warhammer-iii-immortal-empires-is-being-made-free-for-owners-of-the-first-two-games.1359628/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Creative Assembly and Sega have announced that owners of&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer I&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>II&nbsp;</em>(or both, of course) will soon be able to play&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s Immortal Empires campaign for free.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/86" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on the official Creative Assembly website, the developer says that starting from December 4th, all owners of the first two games in the&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer&nbsp;</em>series will gain access to Immortal Empires and its The Lost God prologue campaign at no extra cost.</p>

<p>What's more, even if you don't own&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>, you can still buy Immortal Empires-related DLC to play extra factions in the campaign mode, since you'll access the campaign through a new listing in your library (assuming you don't own the third game, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/total-war-warhammer-iii-immortal-empires-free-first-two-games-grand-cathay.jpg?itok=PzNJIsGN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/total-war-warhammer-iii-immortal-empires-free-first-two-games-grand-cathay.jpg?itok=gLiw2Ui8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s Immortal Empires campaign will soon be free to owners of the first two games.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, if you already own&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>, then nothing will change for you, but this should make it easier for you to recruit some friends to enjoy Immortal Empires alongside.</p>

<p>This update also doesn't include any of <i>Total War: Warhammer III</i>'s other content, so if you want to play the Realms of Chaos campaign or experience any of the Legendary Lords, you'll need to buy the Upgrade Pack, which contains the aforementioned features, plus a couple of extras.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the Immortal Empires campaign for&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer III&nbsp;</em>launched in beta <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-3-immortal-empires-coming-in-august" rel="nofollow">back in August 2022</a>, eventually releasing in full for owners of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-warhammer-iii-update-24-brings-immortal-empires-to-all-players" rel="nofollow">the following February</a>.</p>

<p>Creative Assembly describes Immortal Empires as a "vast sandbox campaign encompassing the entire&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>world" and "the culmination of the entire&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer&nbsp;</em>series, so it's not just an extra; it's essentially the flagship feature of the newest game.</p>




<p><em>Total War: Warhammer III</em>'s Immortal Empires campaign is available now to everyone who owns the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Steam</a>, and it's also coming to owners of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/364360/Total_War_WARHAMMER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer I</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594570/Total_War_WARHAMMER_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">II</a>&nbsp;</em>on December 4th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Quest</em> has been having a renaissance with the recent releases of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preview-pax-east-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review-all-that-glitters-are-pixels" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em></a>. These remakes garnered high praise among the masses for revitalizing three iconic classics for the modern era, and make no mistake—Square Enix has every intention of continuing to deliver amazing, creative remakes of timeless classics with the upcoming release of <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>. This game is sure to stun audiences with its beautiful hand-crafted 3D art style, modern gameplay features, and heartwarming story.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> is based on the original PlayStation title released in 2000 in Japan, then remade for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013, and focuses on the adventures of a group of childhood friends who leave their home of Estard Island to embark on a high-stakes adventure across the seas and through time itself to battle against unknown, evil forces and discover the mysteries of their world.</p>

<p>My one-hour hands-on experience with <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>&nbsp;showed off a delightful game full of charm and mystique while also embodying the same fun, lighthearted spirit that made the original <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> such a well-revered title among fans of the franchise.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_01.jpg?itok=HhIbPh8P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_01.jpg?itok=jgVGCfKW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I started my time in the demo in Wetlock, a small town playing host to a traveling musician named Old Man Riffer. When I entered the village, Old Man Riffer was entertaining the villagers with his torban before quickly trying to leave despite the villagers' protests. At night, while staying in the inn, a haunting melody began to play, opening portals that spirit away the villagers into the unknown, prompting the party to investigate the strange disappearances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When traversing the continent in search of answers, I found myself stumbling across Spliton-on-Sea, an abandoned fishing village that exhibited signs of being plagued by the same mystery as Wetlock. While exploring the map and interacting with important locations, the playable characters would trigger opportunities to talk to certain characters to get their thoughts on current events and helpful hints on where to go next.</p>

<p>Eventually, I found my way to Highendreigh Tower and began uncovering the truth behind the disappearances in Wetlock and Spliton-on-Sea, which led to the sudden appearance of Gracos the Demon King, who submerged the entire small island continent in water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’ve ever played a <em>Dragon Quest</em> game before or if you’re new to the franchise, the mechanics are easy to catch on to. Players get four basic commands: Attack, which launches a basic attack with your equipped weapon; Skills, which allows players to chose from a variety of abilities and spells that can be used by each character based on their growth and class; Items that can be used to to heal and buff players or attack and debuff enemies; and Defend to reduce damage from incoming enemy attacks.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_13.jpg?itok=vhTcCOro 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_13.jpg?itok=YR950owq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Let Loose ability has also been added to <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>, which activates after a character has been worked up during combat to allow them to unleash a powerful attack or skill.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> also introduces the brand-new feature called Moonlighting, where the player can assign an additional class to each playable character to gain special abilities and skills to the playable characters. These additional classes can be changed at-will while playing without having to go anywhere special, like a church, inn, or checkpoint to change that additional vocation, and I found it really fun to be able to switch them whenever to create different strategic combinations before heading into battle.</p>

<p>One of my favorite characters to utilize was Aishe, who had Destiny’s Dancer as one of her vocations, giving her access to M-Pathy, a powerful healing spell.</p>

<p>I also had her as a Troubadour, which allowed her to cast Divine Intervention to prevent the party from experiencing instant death from an attack. This combination made her a powerhouse healer while still being effective at offensive attacks with her sword. Ruff, Maribel, and the protagonist also had their own combination of unique spells and abilities in the demo, and being able to mix and match to address any combat situation helped to keep the game refreshing and engaging.</p>

<p>The second location available in the demo was Emberdale at an earlier part of the game, which allowed me the chance to play as Kiefer, the Prince of Estard, alongside Maribel and the protagonist. When the party arrived in Emberdale, the town had been experiencing strange tremors from the volcano near their town, so they started preparations for the Flaming Festival to give fire back to the volcano as a tribute in hopes of stopping it from erupting.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_11.jpg?itok=kLZZdfU6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_11.jpg?itok=Fl2uWDb2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Meanwhile, Palmela, the town clairvoyant, had been trying to prevent the townspeople from doing that because she was certain the volcano would erupt because of it. At night, the townsfolk go to the volcano and begin feeding it their flames, but it slowly awakens the Glowering Inferno, a fire-based monster that had been living inside the volcano with plans to destroy the continent Emberdale sits on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The battle against the Glowering Inferno felt tense due to the limited abilities the party had access to in this demo, but it may also have to do with the fact that I sped down to the bottom of the volcano without fighting many enemies along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the difficulties of the battle, various vocational abilities aided in making the battle easier to progress through. The protagonist had the Fledgling Fisherman vocation, which allowed him to use Ocean’s Devotion, an ability that made it so each ally would neutralize the next attack that targeted them.</p>

<p>Maribel, as a Mini Mayoress, could use Shewrd Operator, which allowed her to see through enemy resistances to make elemental attacks more effective. Keifer with the Heir Apparent vocation would cast Royal Flush, which reduced his defense stats while significantly increasing his attack power and critical hit chances.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dq7r_emberdale_09.jpg?itok=w9zZYwh- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dq7r_emberdale_09.jpg?itok=RRMBwXn7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As I played through both demos, I couldn’t help but focus on the standout aspect of <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>: the graphics. The beautiful diorama-esque style makes it feel like the player is looking down on a miniature world while moving around living-breathing maquettes rather than just simple 3D models.</p>

<p>It makes sense given Square Enix scanned in hand-crafted, super-detailed dolls of all of the main playable characters to give the game its unique, distinct art style, differentiating it from other Dragon Quest games while still embodying the charm of the character designs illustrated by the late Akira Toriyama.</p>

<p>As I finished my time with <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>, I couldn’t help but wish I could have played even more because of how much fun I was having. There were also plenty of hidden mysteries within the demo that I wished I had the chance to find and experience, but that just means I have plenty to look forward to when the game comes out next year, and fans of the franchise or newcomers looking for a new turn-based RPG will also have plenty to enjoy and explore, too.</p>
