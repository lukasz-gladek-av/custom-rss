Here's everything that was announced during the show!</p>

<hr><h2><em>Lumines Arise&nbsp;</em>is an all-new puzzler coming later this year</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lumines-arise-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=eUWLMrvS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lumines-arise-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=QCnw9ywE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Lumines&nbsp;</em>game is on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, we got a look at a new puzzle game in the&nbsp;<em>Lumines&nbsp;</em>series, which is coming to PS5 later this year (and also to PlayStation VR2, if that matters to ya). It'll pack in 30 stages across a number of new backdrops, plus more of the music you know and love.</p>

<h2>Hey, Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>isn't dead</h2>




<p>Capcom stepped up next to reveal a new trailer for sci-fi adventure&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>, which has been missing in action <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pragmata-thrusts-you-into-strange-new-earth" rel="nofollow">for quite some time</a>, prompting some to believe it was dead. Turns out it isn't, and its rather unique-looking gameplay has you controlling two characters at once. This one launches in 2026.</p>

<h2><em>Romeo Is a Dead Man&nbsp;</em>looks very, very Suda51</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/romeo-is-a-dead-man-playstation-state-of-play-2025.jpg?itok=8X6Wdx6h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/romeo-is-a-dead-man-playstation-state-of-play-2025.jpg?itok=BvHNR3P1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Romeo Is a Dead Man&nbsp;</em>is a characteristically Suda51 game.</figcaption></figure><p>Grasshopper Manufacture's&nbsp;<em>Romeo Is a Dead Man&nbsp;</em>was next on the slate, and it looks like exactly what you'd expect from a Grasshopper game. It's an action title with exactly the kind of over-the-top aesthetic you've come to love from the studio and its founder, and it's coming next year.</p>

<h2><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>launches on September 25th</h2>

<p>Konami revealed the release date for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami" rel="nofollow">upcoming psychological horror game</a>&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, which will be launching on September 25th. That release date holds true not only for PS5, but also for PC and Xbox, so don't worry if you're not a PS5 owner.</p>

<h2>A new&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained&nbsp;</em>game is coming</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodstained-the-scarlet-engagement-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=oyZ4HlOj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodstained-the-scarlet-engagement-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=0EFdev1f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement&nbsp;</em>returns to the Metroidvania stylings of&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Next, a brand new game in the&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement</em>, was announced for 2026, and unlike the old-school&nbsp;<em>Curse of the Moon&nbsp;</em>spinoff series, this one's a true blue Metroidvania. You'll be switching between two characters,&nbsp;<em>Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</em>-style, to explore a new castle.</p>

<h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>gets a release date</h2>

<p>If you've been excited to check out the next game in the&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story&nbsp;</em>series, you're in luck.&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>launches on October 3rd, and we got some more info about its story, characters, and customization elements as well.</p>

<h2><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles&nbsp;</em>revives a strategy classic</h2>




<p>In a similar vein to 2022's&nbsp;<em>Tactics Ogre: Reborn</em>, a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Tactics&nbsp;</em>was announced during the State of Play June 2025 show. It'll boast improved visuals, quality-of-life improvements, and fully voiced dialogue when it launches on September 30th.</p>

<h2>Release date sizzle reel</h2>

<p>Next, we got release dates for some games that have already been revealed. Here's a list of the new release dates we got!</p>

<ul><li><em>Baby Steps&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baby-steps-bennett-foddy" rel="nofollow">from Bennett Foddy and Devolver Digital</a>): September 8th</li>
	<li><em>Hirogami&nbsp;</em>(origami platformer from Bandai Namco): September 3rd</li>
	<li><em>Everybody's Golf Hot Shots&nbsp;</em>(golfing sim from Bandai Namco): September 5th</li>

	<li><em>Cairn&nbsp;</em>(climbing game from the&nbsp;<em>Haven&nbsp;</em>devs): November 5th</li>
</ul><h2><em>Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection&nbsp;</em>brings retro fighting thrills this year</h2>

<p>Next up, Digital Eclipse revealed&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection</em>, a package containing (or perhaps that should be "kontaining") many old-school&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>games. Eight have been announced so far, and more reveals are on the way before release later this year.</p>

<h2>Project Defiant is a wireless fight stick made by Sony</h2>

<p>If you're into your fighting game peripherals, you may want to take a look at Project Defiant, a wireless fight stick created by Sony. It's got the signature PS5 look to it, but built into a classic fighting peripheral design. This one is coming next year.</p>

<h2><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>shows off its boss battles</h2>

<p>Boss battles have always been the cornerstones of a&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>game, and&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>is no exception. Konami's upcoming remake looks like it'll faithfully recreate Snake's battles against the Cobra Unit when it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">arrives in August</a>.</p>

<h2><i>Nioh 3&nbsp;</i>announced for next year, limited-time demo available now</h2>




<p>That's right: there's going to be a new&nbsp;<em>Nioh&nbsp;</em>game, and what's more, you can try it out right now.&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS5 next year, offering a choice between two distinct combat styles. A limited-time demo can be downloaded right now on the PlayStation Store.</p>

<h2><em>Thief&nbsp;</em>is back...in VR form</h2>

<p>Next was perhaps one of the cruelest teases of the entire State of Play show. The venerable&nbsp;<em>Thief&nbsp;</em>franchise is back, but&nbsp;<em>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow&nbsp;</em>is, as you've probably come to realize, a VR-exclusive game. It comes to PS VR2 later this year.</p>

<h2><em>Tides of Tomorrow&nbsp;</em>is a colorful-looking adventure from the&nbsp;<em>Road 96</em>&nbsp;devs</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tides-of-tomorrow-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=SziQv_NQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tides-of-tomorrow-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=5OSFFtmj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tides of Tomorrow&nbsp;</em>is an asynchronous multiplayer game from&nbsp;<em>Road 96&nbsp;</em>developer DigixArt.</figcaption></figure><p>DigixArt, the studio behind&nbsp;<em>Road 96</em>, appeared next to show off&nbsp;<em>Tides of Tomorrow</em>, its colorful adventure with an "intriguing asynchronous multiplayer" element that shows you not only your choices, but a previous player's choices as well. It's coming in February.</p>

<h2><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is getting new challenge levels</h2>

<p>Team Asobi head Nicolas Doucet took to the virtual stage next to reveal that beloved platformer&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is getting five new challenge levels later this month, and you'll be able to rescue new PlayStation-inspired bots as well.</p>

<h2><em>Sea of Remnants&nbsp;</em>is a new pirate RPG coming next year</h2>




<p>If, like many, Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>didn't do anything to quell your desire for pirate adventure,&nbsp;<em>Sea of Remnants&nbsp;</em>could well do the trick. It's a stylized puppetry-inspired pirate RPG coming sometime next year.</p>

<h2><em>Sword of the Sea&nbsp;</em>is the&nbsp;<em>Journey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Pathless&nbsp;</em>artist's next adventure</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sword-of-the-sea-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=bDWQyvox 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sword-of-the-sea-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=R73wxomm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll never guess who's behind this one.</figcaption></figure><p>The first few seconds of the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Sword of the Sea&nbsp;</em>pretty much gave away who was behind it. This one comes from Matt Nava, the artist behind&nbsp;<em>Journey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Abzu</em>, and it's coming on August 19th, with a day one PS Plus Extra release lined up.</p>

<h2>More games are heading to PS Plus</h2>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Sword of the Sea</em>, Sony also revealed during the showcase that the PS2 version of classic immersive sim&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex</em>, as well as racers&nbsp;<em>Twisted Metal 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4</em>, are coming to the Classics Catalog in June and July. Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Myst&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Riven</em>, are also coming to the service.</p>

<h2>IO Interactive shows off a little bit of&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em></h2>

<p>Next, it was IO Interactive's turn to show off <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-007-first-light" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>adventure&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em></a>, and it looks...well, like a&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>game, shockingly enough. This one's coming next year, and we'll get more info about it in the coming days.</p>

<h2><em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>is getting a gameplay deep dive in July</h2>

<p>A very brief clip of&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>was shown next, and Sony says a gameplay "deep dive" is coming in July, so we'll get to learn more about the game then. This one is launching in October, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">as previously revealed</a>.</p>

<h2><em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls&nbsp;</em>is an anime-inspired fighter coming next year</h2>




<p>Finally, we got a reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em>, a gorgeous-looking anime fighter from&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>developer Arc System Works. The game will feature Marvel mainstays like Captain America, Spider-Man, and Storm, and it's coming next year.</p>

<hr><p>That's everything we got to see during this year's Sony State of Play show! Hopefully, we'll be learning more about some of these rather exciting-looking games in the coming months.</p>
