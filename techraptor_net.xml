            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nine-sols-sales-800k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Red Candle Games has revealed that Metroidvania action platformer&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>has reached a big sales milestone, with the game also celebrating its first anniversary.</p>

<p>Released on May 29th last year,&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>has, according to a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1809540/view/544484746860692250" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, reached 800,000 copies since its launch. That number counts across all platforms, too, so it includes not only the game's initial PC release, but also November's console ports.</p>

<p>Red Candle also includes a timeline of&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' achievements in the post, revealing that by the six-week mark, the game had reached 6,000 Steam reviews and earned itself an Overwhelmingly Positive rating (which, across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all reviews</a>, it still holds at time of writing).</p>

<p>The game revolves around Yi, who must seek out the titular nine Sols in order to take their Sol Seals. His true motivations are unclear at the outset of the game, but become clearer as the plot progresses.</p>

<p>Yi also befriends a young human child by the name of Shuanshuan at the start of&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>, and it's his relationship with Shuanshuan that informs his character development and reveals more about the world in which the game takes place.</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>is a Metroidvania, that might not be the best attitude with which to approach it; you can think of it more as a semi-linear platformer that takes influence from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice" rel="nofollow">Sekiro</a>&nbsp;</em>than as a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight</em></a>-style sprawling and interconnected experience.</p>




<p>If you'd like to give&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>a go (and I'd recommend you do so), you can check it out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007919" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/nine-sols/9N3LGKGF3CC2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nine-sols-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. It's well worth your time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Yooka-Laylee Studio Playtonic Officially Confirms Layoffs]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playtonic-layoffs-yooka-laylee</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yooka-laylee-studio-playtonic-officially-confirms-layoffs.1202589/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playtonic-layoffs-yooka-laylee<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Yooka-Laylee&nbsp;</em>developer Playtonic has officially confirmed that it's been hit by layoffs, describing those who have been let go as "some truly brilliant members of [the developer's] team".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PlaytonicGames/status/1928429175062265999" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Playtonic says that although it explored "every possible avenue" to avoid layoffs, it was forced to make the same "painful decisions" that many other studios across the industry are currently facing.</p>

<p>The developer says the layoffs are not a "reflection of anyone's talent or dedication", but that "the landscape is shifting", forcing Playtonic to adapt to changing times. The company doesn't reveal how many staffers have lost their jobs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yooka-replaylee-playtonic-layoffs.jpg?itok=s2M4IjuZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yooka-replaylee-playtonic-layoffs.jpg?itok=krkK8pSP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Playtonic has confirmed it's being hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>Playtonic says that the layoffs don't just represent a "difficult moment" for the studio, but rather a "period of profound change in how games are created and financed", although it doesn't go into any further detail.</p>

<p>What is for certain is that Playtonic is far from the only studio to be hit by layoffs in recent months. Big studios like&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>&nbsp;publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">Ubisoft</a>, EA subsidiary and&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">Respawn</a>, and British outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sumo-group-layoffs-refocus" rel="nofollow">Sumo Group</a>&nbsp;have all been caught up in the industry sea change Playtonic identified.</p>

<p>Since forming in 2014, Playtonic has released just two games, namely 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee&nbsp;</em>and its 2.5D spinoff&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair</em>. It's currently working on a remaster-slash-remake of its first game with the rather amusing title&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Replaylee</em>.</p>

<p>In addition to its development division, the studio also has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playtonic-partners-publishing-label-announced" rel="nofollow">publishing arm</a>&nbsp;by the name of Playtonic Friends, under which games like&nbsp;<em>BPM: Bullets Per Minute</em>,&nbsp;<em>Lil Gator Game</em>, and cozy farming sim&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cattle-country" rel="nofollow">Cattle Country</a>&nbsp;</em>have been released.</p>

The game is currently set for release sometime this year, so stay tuned for more.</p>
