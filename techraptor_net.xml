            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tetris-nintendo-switch-online-the-grand-master<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced another new NES addition to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and you're bound to get along with this one if you like classic old-school puzzle games.</p>

<p>None other than the NES version of legendary block-arranging puzzler&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>is heading to Switch Online next week; it'll be added to the service's lineup on December 12th, and you'll be able to play it as long as you have an active Switch Online subscription.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that this isn't the first version of&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>to land on Switch Online. The iconic Game Boy version has been available on the service <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-boy-and-game-boy-advance-titles-are-finally-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">since 2023</a>, and if you count&nbsp;<em>Panel de Pon&nbsp;</em>as a&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>game (since it was localized as&nbsp;<em>Tetris Attack&nbsp;</em>in 1996), then that's been on Switch Online <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-getting-new-snes-and-nes-games" rel="nofollow">since 2020</a>.</p>

Screenshot courtesy of YouTube channel World of Longplays and Spikestuff.</figcaption></figure><p>This is Nintendo's version of&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>as opposed to the short-lived Atari version released earlier in 1989; that version was pulled from sale pretty quickly after its release, and you won't even find it on the recent&nbsp;<em>Tetris Forever&nbsp;</em>collection.</p>

<p>Still, it's nice to get to enjoy another version of this classic puzzler on Switch Online, even if <a href="https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-nes-games/48" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">many</a> do seem to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/12/feature_how_nintendo_killed_the_best_version_of_tetris" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">regard</a> the Atari version as technically superior.</p>

<p>That's not all that's happening in the world of&nbsp;<em>Tetris</em>, either. Earlier today, developer Arika announced a new installment in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Tetris the Grand Master&nbsp;</em>series, and it's scheduled for release next year.</p>

<p>The appropriately-named&nbsp;<em>Tetris the Grand Master 4: Absolute Eye&nbsp;</em>will land on PC via Steam "by the end of March 2025", according to Arika. There's no word yet on whether it's getting a console release, but it will be an "offline game", Arika says.</p>

<p><em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>lands on Nintendo Switch Online on December 12th.&nbsp;<em>Tetris the Grand Master 4: Absolute Eye&nbsp;</em>is set to come to Steam next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>
