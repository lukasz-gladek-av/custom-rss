            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Francis Coulombe and publisher Devolver Digital have announced a major new update for pixel horror RPG&nbsp;<em>Look Outside</em>, and it's adding new quests, new monsters, and more to the apartment building-bound adventure today.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer, the Final Vision update, which is free for everyone who owns the base game, is adding a number of new features, including "multiple new endings", so you'd better get started on that new playthrough right now.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new interactions, new areas to explore, and new quests to complete, as well as "dozens" of new monsters to battle.&nbsp;<em>Look Outside&nbsp;</em>is also getting new boss encounters as part of this update, as well as "horrible new secrets", which is enticing. I think.</p>

Much like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rv-there-yet-sales" rel="nofollow">fellow indie hit&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?</em></a>, the game began as a game jam submission, but in&nbsp;<em>Look Outside</em>'s case, developer Francis Coulombe expanded on its initial content thans to positive feedback.</p>

<p><em>Look Outside&nbsp;</em>sees you playing as Sam, a young man who's trapped in his apartment building thanks to a horrifying cosmic entity that turns everyone who looks at it into monstrous abominations.</p>

<p>Together with whatever survivors you can find in your building, it's up to you to explore the high-rise in order to find out whether there's a way for you to get everything back to normal, fighting off the monstrosities you encounter along the way.</p>




<p>I'd thoroughly recommend&nbsp;<em>Look Outside</em>, honestly; much like&nbsp;<em>Fear &amp; Hunger&nbsp;</em>(although it's significantly less punishing than those games), Coulombe's RPG is infinitely more unsettling than many higher-budget titles thanks to its lower-fidelity artwork, and it's a non-linear joy to play as well.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Look Outside&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3373660/Look_Outside/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-duckov-sales-2m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-duckov-sales-reach-2m-in-under-two-weeks.1337152/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Team Soda and publisher bilibili have announced yet another huge sales milestone for single-player&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>riff&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em>, so it's safe to say the two studios have a solid hit on their hands.</p>

<p>As revealed by Team Soda and bilibili <a href="https://x.com/GameDuckov/status/1983053864820453385" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on X</a>,&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell a whopping two million copies since launching earlier this month. It's achieved that figure in less than two weeks, which is impressive.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the newly-announced sales figure means that&nbsp;<em>Duckov&nbsp;</em>has picked up another 1.5 million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-duckov-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">since October 20th</a>, when Team Soda and bilibili revealed that their game had shifted 500,000 copies in its opening weekend alone.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/escape-from-duckov-2m-sales-gameplay.jpg?itok=ptRHXCDq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/escape-from-duckov-2m-sales-gameplay.jpg?itok=FTlot79H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>has quacked - sorry, racked - up two million sales in its first two weeks.</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>seems to deserve its high sales, as it's earned itself an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Overwhelmingly Positive rating</a> on Steam across over 3,000 reviews in the last couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Despite the name,&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>doesn't actually share too much in common with&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>; it's a survival-focused looter-shooter, but it adopts a top-down isometric perspective as opposed to&nbsp;<em>Tarkov</em>'s first-person shooting.</p>

<p>Obviously, the game is also largely focused around ducks, which...well, I can't confidently state&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>doesn't have any ducks, but it's certainly not quite as duck-centric as Team Soda and bilibili's game.</p>

<p>If you want to get a feel for what kind of game&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>is, you can check out a trailer for it, which shows off some of the (entirely single-player) gameplay as well as the game's overall aesthetic, right here.</p>




<p><em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>is just one of several indie hits currently storming the gaming charts.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, Nuggets Entertainment revealed that its indie driving adventure&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rv-there-yet-sales" rel="nofollow">crossed 1.3 million sales</a>, and they both follow hot on the heels of climbing sim&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-2m-sales" rel="nofollow">hit two million sales itself</a> back in June.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>
