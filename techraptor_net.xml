            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In an announcement that is surprising no one, Bungie has announced a&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>delay, meaning that you will not be seeing their extraction shooter on September 23rd.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Marathon Development Update">announcement</a>, Bungie shares that they came to this decision after reviewing the feedback from the&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>alpha playtest, which had left many users feeling noplussed with the game. The announcement shares three areas of focus that they will be working on (among others):</p>

<ul><li>Improved survival game play
	<ul><li>Better and more difficult AI encounters</li>
		<li>Better rewards in loot and events</li>
		<li>Improving combat</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Setting and visuals
	<ul><li>Increased visual fidelity</li>
		<li>More environmental storytelling and narrative&nbsp;</li>
		<li>A darker tone like the original&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>&nbsp;trilogy</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Social Experiences
	<ul><li>Proximity chat</li>
		<li>Better player experience in single and duo play.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><p>This work will be further informed by them continuing to playtest&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>&nbsp;with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Marathon Release Date and First Gameplay Revealed">users who were in the Alpha</a>. These will be closed playtests, so if you weren't part of the playtest already, you shouldn't expect a chance to hop into&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>&nbsp;anytime soon.</p>

<p>The announcement doesn't state when they are going to release&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>&nbsp;now, but given that Sony had been recently touting it as releasing inside the fiscal 2025 year, it seems likely to be releasing during the first three months of 2026 if they can. Bungie states that they will be announcing the new release date and revealing the changes they've made over the summer sometime this Fall, perhaps even on the previous release date of September 23rd.</p>

<p>This isn't the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-developer-bungie-suffers-layoffs-among-reported-delays-for-final-shape-and" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Destiny 2 Developer Bungie Suffers Layoffs Among Reported Delays for The Final Shape and Marathon">first delay</a> for&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>&nbsp;as Bungie attempts to nail down this new format and get a live service formula for it that they believe can work. Given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Concord Shutting Down, Sony Offering Full Refunds">high profile failure of&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>&nbsp;</a>last year, which was followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Sony Cancels Two Live Service Games, God of War Reportedly Among Them">cancellations</a> of many first party 'games as a service' type projects at Sony Interactive,&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>is being counted on to demonstrate that Sony can make something in this field. Unusually this has to be shown to investors who want the money from a live service game, and gamers who may hesistate following how quickly Sony pulled the plug on their last attempt in the area.</p>

<p>On the bright side, the extra time should make sure that there's no <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Bungie Acknowledges Stolen Marathon Art, Promises &quot;Thorough Review&quot;">plagiarized art</a> in the next version of&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>&nbsp;right Bungie?&nbsp;</p>
