            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that it has acquired a 2.5% stake in Bandai Namco, with a view to "expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202507/25-0724E/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Sony says the goal with regards to acquiring this stake in the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tekken&nbsp;</em>studio is "strengthening engagement, particularly in the anime field", an area in which Sony expects "rapid market growth".</p>

<p>Sony acknowledges its previous collaborations with Bandai Namco, but the company says it wants to expand these efforts beyond "games, anime, and music" into a "broader range of areas", including merchandising, "experiential entertainment", and more.</p>

<p>However, since Sony and Bandai Namco seem focused on the anime and manga part of this partnership, it's entirely possible we'll see some new anime or manga adaptations of Bandai Namco's best-known works.</p>

<p>One particularly obvious addition to that catalog would seem to be&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, which is arguably crying out for an anime adaptation; I'm not a huge fan of the idea of any visual reimagining of FromSoftware's work, but it makes a lot more sense than the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-movie" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed live-action movie</a>.</p>

<p>Other Bandai Namco properties, like&nbsp;<em>Tekken</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series, and perhaps even&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>could be prime candidates for anime and manga adaptation, but of course, we'll have to wait and see what comes of this partnership to find out whether any of those are on the cards.</p>

That success likely comes as a result of the strong performance of 2024 releases like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-5m" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>, the next major expansion for digital trading card game&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, and it's coming to Android and iOS next week.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky&nbsp;</em>will arrive on July 29th. This looks to be a full expansion along the lines of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-set" rel="nofollow">Celestial Guardians</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Space-Time Smackdown</em></a>, rather than a themed booster pack like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis" rel="nofollow"><em>Extradimensional Crisis</em></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove" rel="nofollow"><em>Eevee Grove</em></a>.</p>

<p>As you've probably guessed, the expansion is based around the Generation 2 legendaries Ho-Oh and Lugia, who will be making their debut in&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-ho-oh-lugia.jpg?itok=euI8PCH9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-ho-oh-lugia.jpg?itok=vWoWbzGZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ho-Oh and Lugia will make their debut in next week's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>They'll be joined by the three Gen 2 starters Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile, who are all represented by frankly adorable artwork. If you're a fan of the Gen 2 starters and want to see Chikorita and Totodile ahead of their&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">appearance in October</a>, this one's for you (sorry, Cyndaquil fans).</p>

<p>You can also look forward to the likes of a full art Pichu card, as well as new cards for Gen 2 stalwarts like Cleffa, the infamous red Gyarados that plays a key role in Gen 2's storyline, and more.</p>

<p>Eeveelutions Umbreon and Espeon will be getting new ex cards, and, of course, new Trainer cards will be making an appearance, including Supporters Lyra and Silver, as well as the new Rescue Scarf and Elemental Switch items.</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for <em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em>'s theming and check out some of its new card art, you can do so right here via the expansion's trailer. I'm warning you, though: those starters really are dangerously cute.</p>




<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is available to download and play for free right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>.&nbsp;<em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky&nbsp;</em>arrives across both systems on July 29th.</p>
