            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crytek-layoffs-hunt-showdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Crysis&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown&nbsp;</em>developer Crytek has laid off around 60 employees, citing the same "complex, unfavorable market dynamics" that have claimed jobs across many of the studio's peers in recent months.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/Crytek/status/1889623029723885913" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a>, Crytek says it isn't "immune" to said market conditions, confirming that it's laying off "an estimated 15% of [its] around 400 employees". Layoffs at the studio will, Crytek says, "affect development teams and shared services".</p>

<p>According to Crytek, development on the upcoming next installment in the&nbsp;<em>Crysis&nbsp;</em>series was put on indefinite hold in the third quarter of last year, and since then, the studio has been "trying to shift developers over" to <em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-leak-rumor" rel="nofollow">updated relaunch of PvPvE shooter&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown</em></a>.</p>

The studio says it first explored other avenues for cost reduction before determining that layoffs were "inevitable to move forward".</p>

<p>Affected employees will, according to Crytek, receive "severance packages and career assistance services".</p>

<p>Crytek finishes its statement by reaffirming its belief in&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, confirming that it remains "fully committed" to the game's continuing "operation". If you're playing&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>right now, it sounds like you don't need to worry about the game being affected by these layoffs.</p>

<p>Crytek's round of layoffs are the latest in a long line of staff cuts, studio closures, and project cancellations in the last year or two. Big companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> have been affected, alongside <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">plenty</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-shutdown-dr-disrespect" rel="nofollow">smaller studios</a>.</p>

<p>Instead, it's going all-in on&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, so let's hope that game continues to see success in the future. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things industry-related.</p>
