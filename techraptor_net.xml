            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has revealed the start date for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 4, as well as the two heroes that will be joining the hero shooter's roster during this season.</p>

<p>The game's fourth season, which (naturally) follows on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-3" rel="nofollow">its third back in July</a>, will begin on September 12th. As usual, it's bringing two new heroes with it, one of which may be a little more obscure than the other.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>' first new hero for Season 4 is none other than Matt Murdock, also known as Daredevil, who's sporting a characteristically flamboyant new design in keeping with many of the game's other characters. We don't know what role Daredevil will play in the game yet.</p>

<p>Angela is a Vanguard (that's&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' tank class) whose Ichors can transform into various weapons, including a shield, so she can either block damage or open up "opportunities for her team", according to NetEase. She can also take to the skies to search for new angles of attack.</p>

<p>Of course, the new&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>season will also bring with it a range of new game modes, changes to various game mechanics, and a brand new Team-Up attack as well, so make sure you check out the patch notes when they're released.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can watch this rather wonderfully-animated trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 4, which depicts an epic clash between Angela and Daredevil.</p>




<p>The Season 4 trailer also confirmed a PS4 release for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which will presumably arrive alongside the fourth season next week. Whether or not the console can handle some of NetEase's game's busier moments remains to be seen.</p>

<p>For now, however, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has revealed who's going to be taking the role of Lara Croft in its upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series, as well as when the show is expected to begin production.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>X-Men: Dark Phoenix&nbsp;</em>star Sophie Turner will be playing Lara in the show, which is set to start production on January 19th next year. It's not yet known whether the series will adapt an existing game or tell a new, original story.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>live-action series was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series" rel="nofollow">back in May last year</a>.&nbsp;<em>Fleabag&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>writer and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge is attached to the project as one of its showrunners and executive producers, alongside Chad Hodge, whose credits include the likes of Fox's&nbsp;<em>Wayward Pines&nbsp;</em>and TNT's&nbsp;<em>Good Behavior</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomb-raider-amazon-lara-croft-actress.jpg?itok=tRi3RJnC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomb-raider-amazon-lara-croft-actress.jpg?itok=XuWqwAij 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Amazon's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series has found its Lara Croft.</figcaption></figure><p>Turner's involvement with the show was first mooted back in November last year, but this is the first time Amazon - and Waller-Bridge herself - has confirmed her casting as Lara Croft in an official capacity.</p>

<p>The live-action&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series also isn't the only Lara Croft-starring show currently on the scene; it joins Netflix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-releases-first-look-at-tomb-raider-and-devil-may-cry-animated-series" rel="nofollow">animated series&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em></a>, which is set in the same timeline as Crystal Dynamics' rebooted games.</p>

<p>As for the games, the latest release in the franchise is&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</em>, which, as the name suggests, collects <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">remastered versions of the final three games</a> in the original Core Design series of&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>titles.</p>

<p>Another&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game is also apparently in the works, and according to developer Crystal Dynamics, the project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs" rel="nofollow">wasn't affected by a recent round of layoffs</a> that hit the studio following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">cancellation of The Initiative's&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>, on which Crystal Dynamics was serving as a co-development outfit.</p>




<p>Amazon's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series will begin production in January, but we don't have an air date for it yet. Stay tuned for more on this one and on all things&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>-related.</p>
