            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>3D Realms has announced the release date for its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>reboot, and if you've been waiting for the chance to try this one out, you'll be able to do so later this year.</p>

<p>First <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/painkiller-revival-fall-2025" rel="nofollow">announced back in March</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>reboot, which is developed by Anshar Studios, will be arriving across PC and consoles on October 9th. No mention of a Switch or Switch 2 version of the game has been made.</p>

<p>Since the release date has been announced, pre-orders for&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>are now also open, and if you pre-order the game, you'll get yourself a set of Iron Crusade character and weapon skins into the bargain.</p>

<p>The game was developed by People Can Fly, the studio that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly" rel="nofollow">currently helping out The Coalition</a> with development on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: E-Day&nbsp;</em>(and, sadly, also the studio that recently had to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/people-can-fly-layoffs-projects-canceled" rel="nofollow">cancel two projects and lay off staff</a>).</p>

<p>Unlike the original&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, the new version will revolve around co-op play, and it'll contain hero shooter elements as well; you'll play as one of four characters, each of whom has their own unique perks with which to slay demons.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, though; this version of&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>is still all about killing hordes of rampaging monsters, and it looks like the outlandish weapons and over-the-top feel of the original&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>have made it across to the reboot intact.</p>




<p><em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>arguably shares some challenges with Bungie's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, another shooter that's turned a beloved single-player classic into a multiplayer-focused title. Last week, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">Bungie delayed&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em></a>, citing a need for extra development time to make the game shine.</p>

<p>Whether or not that happens to&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen, but for now, the game is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013491" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/painkiller/9NMSW622HWNH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 10th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Reportedly Planning Big Layoffs Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-layoffs-next-week-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-reportedly-planning-big-layoffs-next-week.1226964/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which alleges that Xbox is planning what sound like sweeping layoffs across the company, shortly before the end of Microsoft's fiscal year.</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jason Schreier</a>&nbsp;(who, in turn, cites "people familiar with the plans who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information"), the planned layoffs at Xbox are part of a "company-wide reorganization".</p>

<p>Schreier's report doesn't estimate how many employees will lose their jobs at Xbox, but he does say the cuts will be "substantial" and that they'll be made "across the entire [Xbox] group", so it sounds like every department has a chance to be affected by the layoffs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gears-of-war-reloaded-xbox-layoffs-report.jpg?itok=mLR1YWmq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gears-of-war-reloaded-xbox-layoffs-report.jpg?itok=IvoQbyAP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox is planning layoffs across its entire division, according to a new report.</figcaption></figure><p>As Schreier points out, this will be the fourth time Microsoft has engaged in layoffs across an eighteen-month period. Most recently, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">let go around 3% of its total employees</a>, with a Microsoft spokesperson then claiming the layoffs were to help the company achieve "success in a dynamic marketplace".</p>

<p>Prior to that, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">another wave of layoffs</a> took place at Microsoft in January. In both cases, Microsoft didn't disclose exactly how many employees lost their jobs, although they did do their employees the courtesy of revealing this information for layoffs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september" rel="nofollow">put into effect in September last year</a>.</p>

<p>That's all in addition to almost 2,000 layoffs from the Xbox gaming workforce in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">January last year</a>. Of course, none of this stopped CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">scoring an eye-watering payrise</a> in October, but then again, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">t'was ever thus</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft hasn't officially confirmed this latest round of Xbox layoffs yet, and it didn't provide comment to Bloomberg either, so we don't officially know these cuts are going ahead. It's entirely possible Microsoft may never publicly announce the cuts, too.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see if Microsoft issues an official statement confirming Bloomberg's reported layoffs. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>
