            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The sun's out, the surf is right, and it's time to get murdered by magical floating merfolk! That's right, we've got your first look at the sprues and basic rules for the newest Idoneth Deepkin releases up for preorder this weekend! Games Workshop sent these along for us to check out, so dive in (okay sorry no more water puns, I promise not to sink that deep again).</p>

<p>Unfortunately we don't have pre-release access to the new Battletome which is also up for pre-release this weekend, so you can use this article really as a chance to check out the sprues for each of these models (along with the pretty built and painted GW-provided photos).</p>

<h2>Ikon of the Sea</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-ikon-of-the-sea.jpg?itok=qWN9DMwY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-ikon-of-the-sea.jpg?itok=Ne1nF9bY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>First up is the Idoneth Deepkin Ikon of the Sea (which can also be built as the Ikon of the Storm), and I have to say I'm really loving the look of this unit. There's a lot of dynamic motion on display here, and it just hammers home that there really isn't anything else in Warhammer that looks like the Deepkin.</p>

<p>The decision to surround these warriors with waves and ocean-bound creatures really sets them in a league of their own, and shows the true creativity Games Workshop can bring to tabletops with they set out with a bold concept. From the rules we've seen so far, the Ikon of the Sea cares about charging, allowing it and another friendly unit within its combat range to add an extra die when charging (up to three). Its glaive also gets a +1 when charging, so this wave movement is captured well.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at the sprue for this model, assembly is painless, with everything slotting together quite nicely.</p>

<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-mathaela.jpg?itok=LF4Q_csU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-mathaela.jpg?itok=8vTV6iLT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Next up is Mathaela, Oracle of the Abyss. For this model, I find the eel-like creatures surround it a bit strange, but I suppose that's the point - this is a mysterious figure surrounded by mysterious denizens of the very deepest depths of the Abyss.</p>

<p>Mathaela has the ability to add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of friendly companion weapons that are nearby, and she's a wizard. The preview article for this model up on GW's website also explains that it "../can also use the Lore of the Abyss to summon the Incarnate of the Deep – a manifestation of the realmsea’s extraordinary power who visit violence upon the foes of the Idoneth."</p>

<p>More on that in a moment, but let's check out the sprue for this model - again, another very straightforward build, which I love to see!</p>

<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-manifestations.jpg?itok=gj4fjerN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-manifestations.jpg?itok=W3UcUtq6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally this week (it's a short one!), we have the Idoneth Deepkin: Manifestation. This manifestation, when summoned, can hit for damage and summon two watery tendrils which can attack on their own.</p>

<p>These tendrils can also strike out against enemies, and can even use a special ability to ensnare a foe engaged in combat with it. Ensnared models aren't able to use commands, so its a great way to lock down your opponent's commanders.</p>

<p>Checking out the sprue for this, I was very happy to see that it all came on one sprue, and didn't involve too many little bits and bobs - I feel like in the old days this would have been an absolute monster to put together.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-manifestations-sprue-photo.jpeg?itok=fykr8KhH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-manifestations-sprue-photo.jpeg?itok=nDTxT0YC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Other than these three products we received for preview this week, there's also the&nbsp;<em>Battletome: Idoneth Deepkin</em>&nbsp;to get the rules for these and updated rules for these new units and the entire army, and the very cool-looking&nbsp;Isharann Soulscryer, which was previously only available as part of the spearhead. Speaking of spearheads, there's a new one coming out for Idoneth as well, the&nbsp;Spearhead: Akhelian Tide Guard.</p>

<p>I don't run this army myself, but I am always in awe of a well-painted one on the table. What do you think? Do you run Idoneth and, if so, will you be picking up these additions? Were you hoping for more support? Let me know in the comments below.</p>
