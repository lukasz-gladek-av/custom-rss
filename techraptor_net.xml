            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the release date for its upcoming wheelchair basketball sports game&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive</em>, with the Switch 2-exclusive title set to launch later this summer.</p>

<p>Per the Nintendo Today news app,&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive&nbsp;</em>will bring its rather unique-looking gameplay loop to the Switch 2 on August 14th. Essentially, it looks like it'll be occupying the same space in the Switch 2's lineup as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-arms-trailers-shows-off-fighters-customization" rel="nofollow"><em>Arms&nbsp;</em>did for the original console</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive</em>, it's a game that sees players taking part in a sport that looks like a cross between wheelchair basketball and&nbsp;<em>Rocket League</em>, and it uses the Joy-Con 2 controllers' new mouse functionality.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/drag-x-drive-release-date-august-hoop.jpg?itok=xit-MTbt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/drag-x-drive-release-date-august-hoop.jpg?itok=M6vZbNiL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Drag x Drive&nbsp;</em>looks to be one of the Switch 2's more unique games, and it's coming in August.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will pit teams of three players against one another, and each player will need to use both Joy-Con 2 controllers in their mouse configuration in order to push the wheels of their wheelchair around the court.</p>

<p>When you're ready to make a shot, you'll have to use your Joy-Con to mimic the movement of tossing the ball in the hoop. Alternatively, you can wheel yourself off the ramp next to the hoop for a slam dunk.</p>

<p>Despite&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive</em>'s similarity to wheelchair basketball, journalist Laura Kate Dale <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/laurakbuzz.bsky.social/post/3lmpb7rrq7c2i" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stated back in April</a> that Nintendo staff were told to refer to the wheelchairs in the game as "vehicles". The reason for this decision is unclear.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of Switch 2 games being rolled out (no pun intended) during the console's initial launch window. Others include flagship racer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, 3D platformer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>, and a host of third-party ports as well.</p>




<p>Said ports apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-game-launch-sales-report" rel="nofollow">haven't been performing too well</a> in comparison to first-party Nintendo titles, although CD Projekt Red's&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>has apparently been a winner for the company, outselling the initial run for the Switch port of&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>.</p>

<p><em>Drag x Drive</em>&nbsp;launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2 on August 14th. Let's hope we get to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-smash-bros-ultimate-livestream-reveals-arms-fighter" rel="nofollow">see one of its characters</a> in a new&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros.</em> installment&nbsp;sometime soon.</p>
