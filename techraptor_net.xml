<blockquote>
<p>“Over the past 30 years, Kosmos has developed into the highest-selling games publisher in the field of family and adult games.</p>

<p>“During this time, Heiko Windfelder has played a very influential role in shaping the fortunes of the company.</p>

<p>“With his passion for special stories, his creativity and his feel for special titles and exceptional authors, he has made a significant contribution to leading the publishing house to this pole position.</p>

<p>“For this, we thank him from the bottom of our hearts on behalf of the management and the entire Kosmos team.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Heiko Windfelder joined Kosmos in 1995, it was the same year they published <em>Catan</em>, one of the most popular board games in the business with over 45 million copies sold, not counting certain <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-masterpiece-kickstarter-fully-funded-within-hour-promoting-bespoke-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">prestige artisanal component</a> sets.</p>

<p>A second popular board game series nurtured by Windfelder was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/exit-game-gate-between-worlds-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Exit</em></a> family series. This is a series of small box escape room board games. Each entry is themed around a different scenario like a sunken ship, a Sherlock Holmes mystery, and even an officially licensed <em>Lord of the Rings</em> scenario where you must escape the temptations of The One Ring.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Windfelder served as program manager with responsibility for the company's toy and game lines. These included <em>The Crew</em>, <em>Imhotep</em>, and the Spiel des Jahres winning <em>Sky Team</em>.</p>
