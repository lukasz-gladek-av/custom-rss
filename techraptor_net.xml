<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-group-shot.jpeg?itok=Z_sFDzxa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-group-shot.jpeg?itok=kt2uOKo_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New products include single-player decks, accessories, booster boxes, and more!</figcaption></figure><h2><b>Disney Lorcana Reign of Jafar Single-Player Decks</b></h2>

<p>One of the best parts of each new set is the release of brand new single-player decks. We’ve covered these single-player decks in the past, include <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-starter-deck-reviews-party-time" rel="nofollow">two from Shimmering Skies</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/disney-lorcana-azurite-sea-starter-decks-review-ahoy-illumineers" rel="nofollow">Azurite Seas</a>. And what always impresses me the most about these are the fact that these are <i>not</i> your run-of-the-mill, paint-by-numbers starter decks.</p>

<p>Though not as complex as the decks that go on to win tournaments, these decks always feel highly distinct from one another, employing different colors and tactics to push toward victory in a way that never feels dumbed down or under-powered.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-starter-decks.jpeg?itok=8-5AEimv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-starter-decks.jpeg?itok=NkdlLnxA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's no pretty way to open the single-player decks, but they contain a 60-card deck, punch-out tokens, and a booster pack!</figcaption></figure><p>The two different Single-Player decks are:</p>

<ul><li><strong>‘A Harmonious Team,’</strong> featuring Tiana from <i>The Princess and the Frog</i> and Bruno from <i>Encanto</i>. This Amber and Amethyst deck has cards focused on singing songs to push your way to victory.</li>
	<li><strong>‘Brave and Brazen,’ </strong>featuring Mulan from <i>Mulan</i> and Stitch from <i>Lilo &amp; Stitch</i>.<i> </i>This Ruby and Steel deck focuses&nbsp;on fast, aggressive play to knock your opponent out before they know what hit them!</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>Each Single-Player Deck contains:</p>

<ul><li>1 Single-Player deck of 60 cards</li>
	<li>2 Foil cards of the characters on the package front</li>
	<li>11 Damage Tokens</li>
	<li>1 Booster pack containing 12 randomized cards</li>
	<li>1 Rulebook</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>MSRP: $16.99 each</p>

<h2><b>Reign of Jafar Illumineer’s Trove</b></h2>

<p>The Illumineer’s Trove is a great way to begin to build out a collection (and keep it sorted), while including some fun essentials that’ll make life easier as you play <i>Lorcana</i>.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-trove.jpeg?itok=icVoJfn9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-trove.jpeg?itok=MnB8Xzr_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Illumineer's Trove makes for a perfect gift if you don't know what to get the Lorcana lover in your life.</figcaption></figure><blockquote>
<p>Each Illumineer’s Trove includes:</p>

<ul><li>8 Booster packs of 12 additional game cards each</li>
	<li>6 Damage-counter ice</li>
	<li>6 Card dividers</li>
	<li>1 Lore counter</li>
	<li>1 Card storage box</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>I really like the cardboard Lore counter, as it can be annoying to use paper or an app to track your lore. The card dividers, in each of the six colors of the game, also have a nice thematic look to them. And who doesn’t want more booster packs?</p>

<p>This is one of the best deals you can get at MSRP, in my opinion, for Lorcana, because for $50 you’re getting those eight booster packs (which isn’t much more costly than buying them in a booster box), the storage stuff, and the dice - which always have a distinct look to them from set to set.</p>

<p>MSRP: $49.99</p>

<h2><b>Reign of Jafar Booster Pack Display</b></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-booster-box.jpeg?itok=-e5xKn1O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-booster-box.jpeg?itok=LeTLGLJS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Can you imagine the restraint it took to not crack all these packs before taking the picture? We're so brave.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, if you just want the cards, a new Booster Display is available. These displays contain 24 booster packs of <i>Reign of Jafar</i>, and are great for building out that collection or playing Draft or Sealed.</p>

<p>MSRP: $143.99</p>

<h2><b>New Playmats, Card Sleeves, and Deck Boxes</b></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-playmats.jpeg?itok=KP_lh4Hm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-playmats.jpeg?itok=RSxTRjGN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip And Dale!</figcaption></figure><p>One of the biggest reasons to love <i>Disney Lorcana</i> is, of course, the incredible artwork on each card - so it comes as no surprise that I’m a huge fan of these new playmats which feature artwork from the cards. While I love the Hades playmat, I’m absolutely obsessed with the new <i>Rescue Rangers</i> mat - I grew up on Chip and Dale, and… now I’ve got the theme song stuck in my head!</p>

<p>Additionally, artwork from the cards features on new sleeves and deck boxes as well, with the classic artwork from Mickey Mouse - Wayward Sorcerer and Tinker Bell - Giant Fairy finally getting their own sleeve and deck treatments (these cards appeared in <em>The First Chapter</em>, back when the game first launched).</p>

<p>Playmat MSRP: $19.99 each</p>

<p>Deck Box MSRP: $5.99 each</p>

<p>Sleeves MSRP: $9.99 each</p>

<h2><b>Reign of Jafar Illumineer’s Quest: Palace Heist</b></h2>

<p>We’re saving the best for last here as I dive into the <i>Illumineer’s Quest: Palace Heist</i>, a cooperative <i>Lorcana</i> game that pits players against Jafar in a thrilling adventure. After playing and loving the previous <i>Illumineer’s Quest</i>: <i>Ursula’s Return</i>, I’ve been eagerly awaiting this release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-illumineers-quest.jpeg?itok=MOPdn6z6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-illumineers-quest.jpeg?itok=BjYEUiwu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Prepare for battle! Against an all-powerful Jafar! Uh... good luck!</figcaption></figure><p>I’ll be following up with a proper review, but this box includes two new 60 card decks which are different from the <i>Reign of Jafar</i> single-player decks we covered above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Illumineer’s Quest: Palace Heist</i> includes:</p>

<ul><li>1 Jafar scenario deck (50 cards) with storage box</li>
	<li>2 player decks (60 cards each) with storage boxes</li>
	<li>1 Oversized Jafar card &amp; 1 Reforged Crown tile</li>
	<li>1 Palace Heist playmat</li>
	<li>2 Cards featuring 4 battlegrounds</li>
	<li>1 Jafar draw token &amp; 5 Lore tracker tokens</li>
	<li>29 Damage counters &amp; 1 Victory card</li>
	<li>Palace Heist rules sheet</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>With the ability to raise or lower the difficulty, this coop game will test your wits and ability to collaborate with the other illumineers at the table. You can even add two more players to the game with additional 60-card decks (like the two single-player decks mentioned above).</p>

<h2>Reign of Jafar - Final Thoughts On New Releases</h2>

<p>This is a thrilling new batch of products coming out aligned to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.disneylorcana.com/en-US/product/reign-of-jafar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Reign of Jafar</em></a>, and I'm so glad they made another&nbsp;<em>Illumineer's Quest</em>&nbsp;- the chance to work with a friend to take down a big bad is something few other TCG's put out (certainly not with any regularity).</p>

<p>As for <em>Reign of Jafar</em> as a set, we're still playtesting and cracking packs, but on the whole I think&nbsp;<em>Lorcana</em>&nbsp;players are really in for a treat. The cards feel impactful, the pace feels a bit quicker (at least for the two starter decks), and the themes and storytelling of the set really shine through.</p>

<p>Head over to your friendly local game store for Pre-release (May 30th) of <em>Reign of Jafar</em>, before it hits online and physical retailers everywhere June 6th! For more info and to preorder, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/C32B3A27-ADB3-43D0-A51B-7B47139CA5F9?maas=maas_adg_A57C5995B7E92D92E2C56A670732089D_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=maas&amp;ingress=0&amp;visitId=912b0245-16c9-4f8d-aff0-64f7fe6dc828" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">check out the official Amazon page</a>.</p>
