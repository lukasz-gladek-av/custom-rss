            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Take-Two head Strauss Zelnick has admitted that&nbsp;<em>Civilization VII</em>, the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>strategy series, is "off to a slow start", but he's confident that 2K and Firaxis can turn the game's fortunes around.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-insists-projections-for-the-lifetime-value-of-civilization-7-are-very-consistent-with-our-initial-expectations-for-the-title-despite-slow-start" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, Zelnick acknowledged that&nbsp;<em>Civilization VII</em>'s beginnings haven't exactly been auspicious, and that the development team has had to "make changes" to the game's initial release version.</p>

<p>He's likely referring to the fact that when&nbsp;<em>Civilization VII&nbsp;</em>launched, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">met with a mixed reception</a> from the series' fanbase, with common criticisms including its UI and the sweeping changes made to the game's core gameplay. 2K and Firaxis subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">pledged to address those criticisms</a>&nbsp;and to continue updating and improving the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-vii-slow-start-city.jpg?itok=kYZFGVYt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-vii-slow-start-city.jpg?itok=0gpmKNE- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Civilization VII&nbsp;</em>is off to a "slow start", Take-Two has acknowledged, but boss Strauss Zelnick is optimistic.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite&nbsp;<em>Civ VII</em>'s "slow start", Zelnick remains optimistic about the game's "lifetime value", suggesting that the long-term performance of the game will make up for its less-than-ideal beginnings. He says that "consumer uptake is better and better" when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Civ VII</em>, and that it will eventually "take its place in its civilization pantheon".</p>

<p>Zelnick says the series "has always been a slow burn", and so the fact that <i>Civilization VII</i>'s initial sales have been slow doesn't mean the lifetime sales will be poor as well.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that while&nbsp;<em>Civ VII</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1295660/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam numbers</a> are currently hovering around the 7,000 mark, its predecessor is enjoying about <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/289070/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">40,000 active players</a>, and even&nbsp;<em>Civilization V&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/8930/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over double the players</a> of the latest game in the series.</p>

<p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>is a series for which players often pick their favorite title and stay with it rather than immediately "upgrading", and so&nbsp;<em>Civilization VII&nbsp;</em>could well achieve the same player numbers as its successors in time.&nbsp;<em>Civ VII&nbsp;</em>is also available on consoles, so many of its players may be on different platforms, too.</p>
