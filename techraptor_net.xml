<figcaption><em>Timberborn </em>is finally getting a 1.0 release.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As noted by Mechanistry in the aforementioned post, <em>Timberborn </em>has come a long way since launching in Early Access back in 2021, having received a number of major updates adding new features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/folktails-vs-iron-teeth-in-timberborn-guide" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bb42b48a-a7ed-45d4-ac0d-3e0e65fc6fce" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">distinct factions</a>, 3D <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-update-6" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d6f3a308-53b5-4b6b-98c6-0d19b287537f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">physics</a>, and new maps, plus lots more.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Timberborn</em>, it's a colony-building sim that takes place on an Earth ravaged by the worst excesses of mankind. Humans have disappeared, but it's okay; beavers are here to pick up the slack.</p><p>You'll guide your colony of beavers through the early stages of building their city, and you'll tend to important management aspects like food production, protection from the elements, and environmental engineering.</p><p>You can check out the new <em>Timberborn </em>lore trailer, which should give you a good sense of what kind of world the game takes place in, right here. Take it away, Shaun.</p>
<p>Upon launching into Early Access, <em>Timberborn </em>proved a pretty major success for Mechanistry, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-sales-surpass-100k-copies-in-first-week" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="66101916-f924-4827-b377-416c6d46fbb6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">attracting over 100,000 sales</a> within the game's first week of release. Here's hoping it can replicate that early interest for the 1.0 release.</p><p><em>Timberborn </em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062090/Timberborn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and it's getting its 1.0 release on March 5th. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Guerrilla and publisher Sony have revealed <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em>, a rather curiously-named entry in the <em>Horizon </em>franchise, and it combines three-player tactical action with a new, more cartoony art style.</p><p>In an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/05/announcing-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">announcement post</a> on the PlayStation Blog, game director Arjan Bak says <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering </em>draws on Guerrilla's "experience from the <em>Killzone </em>multiplayer titles and the momentum of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>" to create a game in which you'll team up with others "to protect a world under threat from deadly machines".</p><p>Bak says combat in <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering </em>will be "tactical, reactive, and deeply skill-based". It looks like there will be a number of game modes, each of which will task you and your squad with taking on "challenging and replayable hunts".</p><figure role="group">

<p>In the announcement post, Guerrilla reveals two modes: Machine Incursion, which Bak describes as a wave-based mode in which you'll take on hordes of machines and "a formidable boss", and Cauldron Descent, a "longer, multi-stage trial" featuring "ever-changing rooms".</p><p>It looks as though <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering </em>will feature set characters with specific skills and loadouts, rather than customizable avatars, although there will be a "roguelite perk system" to help you craft different builds.</p><p>The titular Hunters Gathering will serve as a central hub between missions, and it'll also be where you customize Hunters, upgrade your gear, and buy things from different vendors.</p><p>In essence, <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering </em>looks rather like Guerrilla's take on an <em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em>or a <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="69736224-ca37-469c-8a4b-6afcb8284048" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">sales numbers</a> those games have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-q3-financials-monster-hunter-wilds" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="192024ce-eb17-4c01-b8c8-8f76b5512117" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">managed to accrue</a>, I can't say I'm particularly surprised by this move.</p>
<p>This is, presumably, the multiplayer <em>Horizon </em>game on which Guerrilla announced it was working <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/guerrilla-working-on-multiplayer-horizon-game" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5c7e50de-bca0-4e2d-80e4-c63c438d26db" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">all the way back in 2022</a>, although it's possible the studio has another multiplayer project in store that's yet to be announced.</p><p>It's not the only multiplayer <em>Horizon </em>game on the...er, in the offing, either. In November last year, Sony and NCSoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-steel-frontiers-announcement" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6e846926-a867-4dfb-94eb-b908c540bda9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em></a>, an MMO that is, in fact, very much alive and well, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="48330b11-38dd-412d-b006-5b1915888650" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">contrary to rumor</a>.</p><p>We don't have a release date or window for <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering </em>yet, but it'll arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4244910/Horizon_Hunters_Gathering/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and PS5 when it does launch.
