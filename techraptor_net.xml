            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new beginner-friendly role-playing game has gone live on Kickstarter. David Marron's first major campaign on the platform is <em>Wizard Community College</em>, an RPG that revolves around learning magic at a magic school. The twist is that magic can easily get out of control if you're not careful.</p>



<p>According to the campaign page, <em>Wizard Community College</em> is a role-playing card game designed for 3-8 players. Each game is meant to last about twenty minutes. As the name implies, the players are newly inducted student wizards, solving problems with spells that go horribly wrong. The promo material is light-hearted and comedic, invoking works like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/strixhaven-curriculum-of-chaos-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Strixhaven</em></a>&nbsp;and the TV show,&nbsp;<em>Community</em>.</p>

The rules can easily be taught in about two minutes. The game is GM-less, allowing all players to contribute to the fiction. Lastly, it is designed to contain the best elements of a one-shot adventure. If you have been looking for a way to bring players into the hobby that isn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> or Monster of the Week, this may be the answer.</p>

<p>Setting up a game of <em>Wizard Community College</em> is simple. The scene is established by drawing an Event Card. This will give players objectives to complete. From there, players take turns in clockwise order, casting spells to solve the problem. Those spells are represented by spell cards.</p>

<p>Whenever a spell is cast, a disk is drawn at random from a bag. The symbol of the disk determines how the spell acts up. The color determines which player gets to explain how the spell messes up. The next player then reacts to the complication. This repeats until the main objectives are completed.</p>

<p>There is only pledge tier <em>Wizard Community College</em>: a physical copy of the game at an MSRP of $20 not including shipping. No add-ons or stretch goals are planned. This was an intentional choice by Marron to keep the project affordable and straightforward. A copy of the game contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>45 Spell Cards</li>
	<li>27 Magic Item Cards</li>
	<li>36 Major Event Cards</li>
	<li>18 Minor Event Cards</li>
	<li>8 Double-Sided Character Cards</li>
	<li>9 Player Aid Cards</li>
	<li>32 Colored Wooden Disks</li>
	<li>1 Drawstring Bag</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, Wizard Community College has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$3,380, which is just shy of its funding goal of $4,000. The campaign ends on October 31.</span></span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dune: Awakening Studio Funcom Hit by Layoffs Despite Major Success]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>developer Funcom has announced that it will lay off a number of employees, despite the fact that the survival MMO has been the studio's most successful launch to date.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dune-awakening-developer-funcom-announces-redundancies" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the Oslo-based developer will let an undisclosed number of staff members go in order to "restructure [its] teams and focus [its] resources from across projects and studios".</p>

<p>Funcom says this is needed because of the move to shift&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>"from development to long-term live operation", which, to me, sounds rather like NetEase's shutting down of its Seattle studio after&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' release, although whether a proportionate number of employees will be affected is unclear.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs-training-dummy.jpg?itok=ZlPCk5cv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs-training-dummy.jpg?itok=4MlUBp2- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is effectively what Funcom appears to be doing to its workforce.</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, in the statement given to GI.biz by Funcom, the studio brags about&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>'s success, declaring that it has "shown incredible potential" and that it was "the biggest release" Funcom has enjoyed in its 32-year history.</p>

<p>To me, announcing how successful your latest game has been and then immediately revealing that you're laying off a tranche of employees comes across as rather unforgivably gauche, but perhaps I just don't have a corporation's perspective on things.</p>

<p>Of course, Funcom is right to say&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>has been a big success. The game, which launched on PC back in June, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-sales-1m-infographic" rel="nofollow">managed to hit a million sales</a> within just two weeks of its launch. It's also due to land on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S at some point next year.</p>

<p>Still, Funcom is far from the only studio to lay off employees following a purple patch. Microsoft laid off thousands of employees earlier this year, many of them within the gaming sector, but Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-revenue-up-microsoft-2025" rel="nofollow">revenue actually increased</a> last fiscal year.</p>




<p>It's becoming a very common refrain, but it seems that making and releasing a successful game is no longer enough to guarantee the retention of your job in the gaming industry. Stay tuned to find out which successful studio inevitably becomes the next one to lay off employees regardless.</p>
