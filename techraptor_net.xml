            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Alex Massé has announced that upcoming&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-style indie life sim&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>is being delayed, and it's a pretty hefty delay at that, so you won't be playing this one for a while, unfortunately.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ParalivesGame/status/1989347579856113871" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Massé announces that&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>will now be launching on May 25th next year, having been previously <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paralives-december-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">slated for an Early Access release next month</a>.</p>

<p>Massé says that although the&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>team was confident the game would be ready for December, expanding playtesting beyond the initial player base showed that the game "isn't up to the standard [the team] wanted it to meet for release".</p>

<p>Massé goes on to explain that life sims of this kind, which he calls "doll-house life simulation" games (among which games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed" rel="nofollow">Krafton's&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-profits-life-by-you-canceled" rel="nofollow">now-canceled&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-profits-life-by-you-canceled" rel="nofollow">Life by You</a>&nbsp;</em>mingle), are "really three games in one": a building game, a character creator, and a simulation.</p>

<p>The build mode and character creator are in a place Massé and his team are happy with, but the simulation element requires "a bit more time" for polish, ensuring that&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>offers "a great first experience" for those who decide to check it out.</p>

<p>It's not all bad news, though; on November 25th, a 45-minute "uninterrupted Live mode gameplay" stream will be happening on the&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>YouTube channel, so more info is on the way.</p>




<p>If you want to keep up with&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>as development continues ahead of its new May Early Access release date, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118520/Paralives/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist the game on Steam</a> right now. Stay tuned for more.</p>
