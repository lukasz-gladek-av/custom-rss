            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Focus Entertainment has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>player count has hit a pretty impressive milestone just under three months after the game's initial launch.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1862442675590377854" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on social media platform X</a>, Focus says that&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>has attracted five million players since its release on September 9th. The studio specifically hasn't framed this number as sales, so it's possible it includes those who are streaming the game as part of subscription services like GeForce Now.</p>

<p>Still, five million players is pretty solid, and it's likely the bulk of that number is players who've bought the game, so Focus and Saber can rest assured that they've kept the legacy of original&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>developer Relic Entertainment (which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-relic-entertainment-layoffs" rel="nofollow">recently went independent</a>) intact.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-fight.jpg?itok=GRYEJTDP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-fight.jpg?itok=-T3M2HQp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>proves there's still an audience for good old-fashioned games.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>was originally announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021" rel="nofollow">during the 2021 Game Awards ceremony</a>, alongside the likes of Bokeh Game Studio's&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>and Remedy's&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>.</p>

<p>It sees original game protagonist Captain Titus making a return, although this time, he's not battling the greenskin hordes; instead, he's fighting Tyranids, as well as Chaos Space Marines.</p>

<p>Story-wise, the game sees Titus disgraced following the events of the original game. After serving his penance, Titus is admitted back into the Ultramarines chapter, where he's tasked with exterminating a Tyranid infestation on the planet of Kadaku.</p>




<p>In gameplay terms,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>&nbsp;is, much like its predecessor, a third-person shooter that emphasises both ranged and melee combat. Titus has access to a variety of&nbsp;lore-faithful weapons, including the all-important bolter, as well as a chainsword and a range of explosives.</p>

<p>Alongside its single-player campaign (which can also be enjoyed in co-op),&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>also offers a co-op Operations mission mode and PvP multiplayer, and Focus and Saber have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">pledged to update the game regularly with new content</a>. What's more, these updates will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-no-microtransactions" rel="nofollow">never take the form of microtransactions</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/light-of-motiram-announced-tencent-horizon</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencents-light-of-motiram-has-strong-we-have-horizon-at-home-energy.1048173/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/light-of-motiram-announced-tencent-horizon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tencent and subsidiary Polaris Quest have announced&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>, an open-world survival-crafter coming to PC, PS5, and mobile devices sometime next year, and it bears more than a passing resemblance to a certain PlayStation franchise.</p>

<p>In a press release, Polaris Quest and Tencent describe <i>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</i>as an "open-world multiplayer survival game" set in a "lush world dominated by mechanical beasts". I'm sure that you can guess <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn" rel="nofollow">which PlayStation franchise</a> it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west" rel="nofollow">jostling against</a> from that description.</p>

<p>Said press release also promises a "dynamic, impactful combat system" in&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>, as well as "saga-worthy boss fights" with elemental weaknesses you'll have to exploit alongside your "mechanimal" friends.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/light-of-motiram-tencent-horizon-creatures.jpg?itok=7HTzJn3g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/light-of-motiram-tencent-horizon-creatures.jpg?itok=Uu3FjUHb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Light of Motiram</em>'s PC and console release is on the...uh, the cards for next year.</figcaption></figure><p>It's probably worth pointing out at this stage that if you haven't figured it out already, the PlayStation franchise with which&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>seems to share its mechanical DNA is, of course, Guerrilla's&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>The game's "mechanimals" are strikingly similar to&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em>'s creatures, right down to the soothing blue light that appears to represent their vision and the articulated limbs and appendages the creatures seem to have.</p>

<p>However, gameplay-wise, it seems like&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>will differ quite a bit from Guerrilla's series; it won't be a single-player action-adventure game with RPG elements, but a free-to-play survival-crafter with base-building and a multiplayer focus. Whether that's an improvement, I'll leave up to you to decide.</p>

<p>Polaris Quest and Tencent are promising "realistic physics simulation" in which every object in the game is subject to a physics engine, as well as weather systems you'll need to respond to in order to emerge victorious against the mechanimals and survive in&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em>'s world.</p>




<p>Tencent's game will also differ in a few other key ways; you can enlist mechanimals to help you in combat and crafting, for instance, and you'll also unlock new crafting recipes as you take down bosses, so it looks like you can throw&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>into the mix as well. Jolly good!</p>

<p><em>Light of Motiram&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on PC and "console platforms" next year. Some reports based on Chinese social media&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/mechanimal-open-world-survival-crafting-game-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">seem to indicate</a> this means PS5 only, and that the game is coming to mobile devices too, but the press release doesn't specify. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam right now</a> if you like.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-citizen-funding-passes-750m-amid-layoff-rumors.1048107/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-funding-750m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Crowdfunding for space sim&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>has passed yet another mammoth milestone, but rumors are flying that suggest things may not be rosy at developer Cloud Imperium Games.</p>

<p>A quick look at&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen</em>'s <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">funding page</a> shows that the game has passed the eye-watering $750 million mark, meaning that cumulatively, players have given almost a billion dollars to&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>since its crowdfunding campaign began in 2012.</p>

<p>The funding page is insistent in its declaration that funding for&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>"goes directly to the game's development", although frankly, I can't quite envision a game that costs over $750 million to make and still hasn't been properly released after over a decade of development.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-citizen-funding-firefight.jpg?itok=lQpIjkE- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-citizen-funding-firefight.jpg?itok=mbon8Z5b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Believe it or not, people are still giving money to&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only is <i>Star Citizen</i>'s development continuing with no real sign of a 1.0 release, but rumors are flying that developer Cloud Imperium Games may actually be laying staff off.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cloud-imperium-games-layoffs-report/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson</a>, who cites an ex-CIG employee <a href="https://x.com/Gillyburd1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on social media platform X</a>&nbsp;(whose posts are locked for non-approved followers), Cloud Imperium has let "a lot of staff go over the last two days with zero compensation" following its annual CitizenCon event.</p>

<p>That's after the developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-debacle-crunch-report" rel="nofollow">reportedly mandated</a>&nbsp;seven-day work weeks for staff in the runup to CitizenCon, promising time off in lieu in return for working the weekends of October 5th and 12th. That report didn't seem to suggest that Cloud Imperium had offered staff a choice in this matter.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Cloud Imperium has been in trouble in the last few months, either. Back in July, a tribunal found that the studio had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal" rel="nofollow">discriminated against a disabled worker</a> for mandating a return to the office without making adequate preparations for that worker's disability.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-dlc-q1-2025-new-ip</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lies-of-p-dlc-coming-in-q1-2025-devs-confirm-brand-new-ip-in-the-works.1048086/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-dlc-q1-2025-new-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>developer Neowiz has revealed that the game's long-awaited DLC expansion will be arriving sometime during the first quarter of next year, and there's more exciting news for Neowiz fans as well.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.ebn.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1644423" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> issued by the studio (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lies-of-p-dlc-is-coming-in-the-first-quarter-of-2025-as-developer-confirms-next-its-game/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Neowiz confirms the release window for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>DLC, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-dlc-sequel" rel="nofollow">teased last November</a> following the game's release in September 2023. We still don't know what the DLC will be about or exactly when we can expect it, however.</p>

<p>When the DLC was first teased, Neowiz showed a couple of pieces of concept art related to the expansion, including what appeared to be protagonist P exploring a shipwreck, as well as an industrial facility with a giant pillar at its center.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lies-of-p-dlc-q1-2025-fight.jpg?itok=qvKqI82K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lies-of-p-dlc-q1-2025-fight.jpg?itok=1tTr3Wc1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lies of P</em>'s DLC is coming in the first quarter of next year.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as confirming the release window for the&nbsp;<em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>DLC, Neowiz also reveals what it's working on next in the statement, although again, further details are rather scarce.</p>

<p>Per VGC's translation, the studio is working on an entirely new IP that will take the form of a sci-fi survival horror game. The statement specifically namechecks the likes of 2023's <i>Dead Space&nbsp;</i>remake and Striking Distance's&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, although let's hope Neowiz emulates the former rather than the latter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/callisto-protocol-crunch-is-problem-with-100-hour-work-weeks" rel="nofollow">in terms of development process</a>.</p>

<p>We'll likely have to wait a while for more info on the new survival horror IP being worked on by Neowiz; it's likely the studio will be focusing on the&nbsp;<em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>DLC for the immediate future. Still, a reveal at next year's Summer Game Fest might not be too much to hope for.</p>




<p>In case you haven't come across&nbsp;<em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>before, it's a Soulslike that serves as a loose adaptation of the classic children's novel&nbsp;<em>The Adventures of Pinocchio&nbsp;</em>(although the emphasis is very much on "loose" here).</p>

<p>You play as P, a puppet created by Geppetto who, unlike other puppets, has the ability to lie. You must explore the fictional city of Krat in order to discover what happened to it, why its puppets have gone insane, and what, if anything, you can do to make things right.</p>

<p><em>Lies of P&nbsp;</em>proved very popular indeed, selling <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lies-of-p-sales" rel="nofollow">a million copies</a> within its first month on release despite being a day one Game Pass title.</p>

<p>It's still available there and on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/lies-of-p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox consoles</a> generally, as well as on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627720/Lies_of_P/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lies-of-p/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>.
