            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hero Forge has announced a new Collaborator Collections line for their miniature printing service. The platform has officially partnered with Darrington Press, offering users to print miniatures based on the various ancestries found in the fantasy TTRPG, <em>Daggerheart</em>.</p>

<h2>The Hero Forge Collaborator Collections Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.heroforge.com/content/product-information/about-products/daggerheart/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Hero Forge breaks down what will be featured in the Daggerheart Collaborator Collections. The collection will bring three specific ancestries onto the platform: Simian, Fungril, and Ribbet.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hero-forge-collaborator-collections-fungril.jpg?itok=EAQzoW4y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hero-forge-collaborator-collections-fungril.jpg?itok=AlHMjjOX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The post then breaks down the different features and accessories provided in this collection. Ribbets have their own outfits, adventuring gear, and weapons. Fungril have different mushroom caps and pauldrons to make each one feel unique. Simians have three subtypes supported: Monkey, Orangutan, and Tamarin, respectively.</p>

<p>This granularity is important since the core appeal of Hero Forge is being able to make customizable miniatures for your TTRPG home games. But up until now, the platform mostly stuck to broad fantasy options, allowing the miniatures to be used in anything from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a> and everything between.</p>

<p>Now with this Collaborator Collections announcement, the platform is leaning into more direct partnerships. Given how much <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> has caught on in the tabletop community, this partnership is just another feather in Darrington Press' cap.</p>

<p>The downside is that it is not free. Up to this point, the miniature creation platform on Hero Forge was free to all users. You only paid if you wanted the miniature physically printed. Now, if you want to access official <em>Daggerheart</em> ancestries, you will need to pay $7.99 for each ancestry individually. That's $21.99 for full access, on top of the usual printing fees.</p>

<p>In this context, the launch of Hero Forge Collaborator Collections may be the start of the platform adopting a more aggressive microtransaction model for future options down the road.</p>
