            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Kickstarter campaign for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dont-starve-board-game-coming-from-glass-cannon-unplugged" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em></a> has gone live. Glass Cannon Unplugged's tabletop adaptation of Klei Interactive's acclaimed survival game has been a blockbuster success, reaching its initial funding goal in five minutes and continuing to climb.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glasscannonunplugged/dont-starve-the-board-game/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> for Don't Starve: The Board Game describes the game as a cooperative roguelike experience. Much like its video game source material, 1-4 players are dropped into a land of magic, mad science, and overwhelmingly filled with cruel elements and monsters. Players will need to work together and do all they can to survive.</p>

Exploring the wilderness for food, resources, biomes, and secrets. Crafting those resources into weapons, tools, structures, and devices to help you withstand the weather, the dark, and the locals. Finally, the survival element, where you have to manage your hunger, sanity, and health as you traverse the dark world.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign for <em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em> has several early bird incentives. If you back the game within its first 72 hours, you'll get the Wolfgang expansion, which introduces the playable Wolfgang character, at no additional cost. The expansion will include an unpainted Wolfgang miniature, a holographic character card, and two ability cards.</p>

<p>In addition, each playable character in the board game has a Fortune digital skin, which can be unlocked in the video game spin-off, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-starve-together-sharing-unlocks-across-platforms-in-future-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Don't Starve Together</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em>For those interested in board game add-ons, the campaign includes playmats, dice towers, cardboard terrain packs, and acrylic monster standee packs.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;pledge tiers for <em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Standard Pledge for $79:</strong> The regular edition of the game with acrylic monster standees, any and all unlocked stretch goals, and Don't Starve Together digital character skins</li>
	<li><strong>Deluxe Edition for $129:</strong> Everything in the standard pledge but with unpainted miniatures for monsters and characters</li>
</ul><p>At time of writing, <em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em> has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$746,128, completely decimating its initial funding goal of $50,000. The campaign ends October 23.</span></span></p>
