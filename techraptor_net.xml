            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo and Monolith Soft have announced <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</i>, a remastered version of the 2015 Wii U JRPG&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>.</p>

<p>Launching on March 20th,&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition&nbsp;</em>looks to be doing for its parent game what 2020's&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-announced-for-switch">did for the first game</a> in the series.</p>

<p>Right now, we don't know a lot about what kind of enhancements we can expect from this remaster, other than that it will be "visually enhanced" and that it'll also feature new story elements, although we don't know what those story elements are yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-x-remaster-free-roaming.jpg?itok=ufcTCqEX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-x-remaster-free-roaming.jpg?itok=Z_rx5lQL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X&nbsp;</em>is finally getting a remaster.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>, it's a JRPG from 2015 that is, believe it or not, part of the overarching&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>Although it bears the&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade&nbsp;</em>name, it's not actually narratively connected to any previous entries in the series, although you'll likely recognize some common elements and themes if you're a fan of the franchise.</p>

<p>Unlike other&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade&nbsp;</em>games, you play as a custom-created character in&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>. When you awake from a lifepod after a crash-landing on an alien planet, you must help humanity to explore and colonize this planet, dealing with its dangers as you go.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking,&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X&nbsp;</em>offers similar action-RPG gameplay to its predecessors, although the core exploration gameplay is much more about cataloguing and surveying a new planet.</p>




<p>At first, you'll be exploring the beautiful and savage planet of Mira on foot, but after a while, you'll gain access to a mech with which you can reach certain areas and defeat certain enemies more easily.</p>

<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X&nbsp;</em>is the latest in a line of Wii U games to get Switch remasters. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-announced-for-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario 3D World</em></a>, horror game&nbsp;<em>Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/wonderful-101-remastered-preview">quirky actioner&nbsp;<em>The Wonderful 101</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition&nbsp;</em>launches <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exclusively on Nintendo Switch</a> on March 20th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doloc-town-farming-sim-bullet-hell<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer RedSaw Games and publisher Logoi have announced&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town</em>, a cozy pixel art farming sim with a spicy bullet hell and platforming twist, and you can check it out on Steam now.</p>

<p>In a press release, RedSaw and Logoi say&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town&nbsp;</em>takes place "amidst the remnants of civilization", not unlike Pathea's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-skipping-early-access"><em>My Time&nbsp;</em>series</a>, although it's fair to say&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town&nbsp;</em>is decidedly less idyllic than those games are.</p>

<p>You'll get the chance to build up "automated production systems" on a farm where you can cultivate crops and build facilities, all while you're contending with post-apocalyptic weather conditions like acid rain.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doloc-town-farming-sim-platformer-rainy-forest.jpg?itok=EwApMZJ4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doloc-town-farming-sim-platformer-rainy-forest.jpg?itok=5f92FLkN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Doloc Town&nbsp;</em>looks to be a moody yet cozy post-apocalyptic farming sim.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering what makes&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town&nbsp;</em>stand out amongst a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fields-of-mistria-roadmap">bevy</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-release-date">other</a> cozy <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/my-time-at-sandrock">farming sims</a> on the market right now (or about to be on the market, anyway), the answer could well lie in the game's combat systems.</p>

<p>Rather uniquely,&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town</em>'s combat takes influence from platformers and bullet hell shooters. RedSaw says you'll be able to use "guns and...auxiliary combat drones" to help you battle "dangerous creatures".</p>

<p>Don't worry if you're not much of a bullet hell fiend, though; RedSaw says that the game's customization will allow "flexible combat styles", so you shouldn't need to fret about not having perfect reflexes.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town</em>, which also gives a sense of the game's&nbsp;very&nbsp;<em>Cave Story</em>-esque pixel art aesthetic, right here.</p>




<p>If your interest has been piqued by&nbsp;<em>Doloc Town&nbsp;</em>and you'd like to check it out, then you're in luck; a demo of the game is available right now via Steam, so you can give it a go and see whether it's for you or not.</p>

<p><em>Doloc Town&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but when it does land, it'll arrive <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2285550/Doloc_Town/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on PC via Steam</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-bloodborne-and-final-fantasy-16-designer-velux<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A designer who worked on&nbsp;FromSoftware's&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>and Square Enix's&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>has opened up his own studio by the name of Velux.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/former-fromsoftware-and-square-enix-game-designer-establishes-new-game-company-to-make-games-for-game-lovers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a> (which, in turn, cites a Japanese <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000001.000151924.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>), designer Sho Igarashi will serve as the newly-created Velux Studio's CEO. He's worked not only with FromSoftware and Square Enix, but also with&nbsp;<em>Granblue&nbsp;</em>studio Cygames and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/forspoken">Forspoken</a>&nbsp;</em>developer Luminous Productions.</p>

<p>According to Automaton's translation of the press release, Igarashi's "expertise lies in battle production" (that's Automaton's wording, not the press release's), although it's not clear whether he definitely worked on combat design for the aforementioned games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-velux-studio-sho-igarashi.jpg?itok=ReVpqYIb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-velux-studio-sho-igarashi.jpg?itok=FeE0XH2q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sho Igarashi's credits include&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16</em>, and more.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't know much about Velux Studio, except that per Automaton, the company will be making games across PC, consoles, and mobile devices, and it'll include both "high-end" and "casual" titles in its remit (again, that's Automaton's wording).</p>

<p>The goal here is to "make games for game lovers", or so the press release says, and the studio will be working with Unreal Engine 5 in-house, so it sounds like nothing will be outsourced.</p>

<p>Right now, we don't know exactly what Velux is working on, although if a couple of preview images released on the studio's new <a href="https://velux-studio.co.jp/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a> are anything to go by, it looks like the debut game will have a sci-fi flavor to it.</p>

<p>Velux also has an <a href="https://x.com/VELUX_STUDIO" rel="noopener" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, although naturally, since the studio is new, there isn't much on there yet. Still, you know who to follow if you want up-to-the-minute news about this new company.</p>

In recent years, we've seen studios started up by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors">several ex-<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developers</a>, as well as staffers from big companies like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-bethesda-bioware-naughty-dog-near-studios-hawthorn">Bethesda</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-ea-staffers-three-thousands-studio">EA</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-staffers-birdkin-hideaki-saori-utsumi">Capcom</a>, among others.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what Velux Studio will reveal as its debut title, but let's hope we find out sooner rather than later. Stay tuned for more.</p>
