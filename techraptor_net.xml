            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insomniac-ceo-founder-ted-price-steps-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After more than 30 years with the company, Insomniac Games CEO and founder Ted Price is stepping down. His role will be filled by three of the studio's executives, who are stepping up as co-studio heads.</p>

<p>In a Sony <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Price says he's retiring from the industry as a whole rather than moving on to new opportunities. He says he's leaving the studio in "one of the strongest positions we've experienced in years", and that he's put a succession plan in place that will provide "continuity, stability, and strong leadership".</p>

<p>To that end, three execs will be stepping up to fill Price's shoes: marketing and brand head Ryan Schneider, finance head and CFO Jen Huang, and head of creative Chad Dezern. It's not clear whether they'll also continue those roles in addition to heading up Insomniac.</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like a great deal is going to change in an operational sense with Price's stepping down. It's likely that you'll notice the difference far more if you're an Insomniac employee than if you're a fan of their games.</p>

<p>The three do eulogize Price's career in a rather touching way, though, calling him "not just our leader" but also "our longtime friend" and praising his "ability to inspire everyone around him to grow".</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for that one yet, so stay tuned for more on this and all other things Insomniac Games.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/midnight-special-is-a-nostalgic-horror-point-and-click-that-you-can-try-now.1088805/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie studio Yahaha Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>Midnight Special</em>, a nostalgic horror point-and-click adventure inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Clock Tower&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>, will be coming to Steam Early Access "soon".</p>

<p>In a press release, the studio describes the game as a mixture of "nostalgic '90s 16-bit gameplay" and "cinematic horror", with touchstones like Dario Argento's giallo movies and classic 80s slashers contributing to its tone and aesthetic.</p>

<p><em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>casts you as Sarah, a babysitter (because of course she is) who gets caught up in what Yahaha describes as "a night of psychological terror". I don't think it's possible to be a babysitter without going through at least one of those.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click-dialogue.jpg?itok=FIbhkWE- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click-dialogue.jpg?itok=57pO8UWO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>is a nostalgic horror point-and-click adventure, and you can try it out right now.</figcaption></figure><p>You can look forward to spooky delights like "eerie phone calls", which feel like a classic trope for 70s and 80s horror, and "a seemingly alive plastic dinosaur", which absolutely doesn't feel like a trope.</p>

<p>Yahaha says you'll like this one if you're a fan of old-school survival horror, point-and-click adventure games, and "atmospheric mysteries that keep you guessing", and it's hard to imagine anyone who isn't a fan of the last one on that list, at least.</p>

<p>Most intriguingly, the developer promises a touch of "retro sci-fi" in&nbsp;<em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>as well, so it sounds like things take a decidedly weird turn. Consider me on board for this one.</p>

<p>The game's Steam page shows off some rather evocative imagery, including what looks like a millipede crawling in and out of the mouth and eye sockets of a corpse. You'll probably know whether this one's for you or not based on that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click-room.jpg?itok=F9qXw-5W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click-room.jpg?itok=3sXYyJPx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you like spooky vibes and 80s horror,&nbsp;<em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>is for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, you don't have to judge by screenshots alone; a demo is available for you to check out right now. All you've got to do is download it on Steam and you're set.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>yet, but when it lands, it'll come to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2560100/Midnight_Special/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Early Access</a>. The devs estimate it'll stay there for around 12-18 months before getting a full release.</p>
