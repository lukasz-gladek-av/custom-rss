            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <em>The One Ring</em> starter set is coming. Free League Publishing has announced a new way for both fantasy RPG and Tolkien fans to get a taste of their award-winning RPG set in the land of Middle-earth. Better still, they will be available at Gen Con.</p>

<h2><em>The One Ring</em> Starter Set Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the new <em>The One Ring</em> starter set is a beginner-friendly, condensed version of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/one-ring-rpg-second-edition-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">second edition</a> of the licensed TTRPG. The starter set includes a new, prewritten adventure, <em>Over Hill and Under Hill</em>, which takes place&nbsp;sometime before Bilbo Baggins' journey to The Lonely Mountain and the return of Sauron. It takes the players on a journey through the Lone-Lands of Eriador.</p>
