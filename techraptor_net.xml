            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-reach-4x-space-sim<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-Ubisoft and Creative Assembly staffer James Miller has announced&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach</em>, a 4X space sim from his new studio Stelleas, and it's due to arrive on PC this September.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Miller intends&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>to be "as rewarding for genre veterans as it is approachable for newcomers", which is a hard sell; this is, after all, a famously complex genre, but perhaps Miller can truly straddle the line.</p>

<p>Miller and Stelleas promise "classic 4X gameplay across a real-scale, fully 3D star-system map", so if you're a fan of the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stellaris" rel="nofollow">Stellaris</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sins-of-solar-empire-is-making-comeback-after-15-years" rel="nofollow"><em>Sins of a Solar Empire</em></a>, then you're probably going to dig this one as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-reach-4x-space-sim-ui.jpg?itok=eckYfwOP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-reach-4x-space-sim-ui.jpg?itok=Nd4h-kbI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>aims to offer classic 4X space sim fun.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>will feature eight different factions, and Miller says each of them will have "unique tech trees and strategic approaches". You can also look forward to three distinct victory paths: Supremacy, Prosperity, and Industrial Supremacy, which are all fairly self-explanatory.</p>

<p>There's also a "comprehensive research system" in the game, which will grant you access to six tech trees and shared technologies that enable "strategic synergy".</p>

<p>You'll be able to exploit 13 different resource types across&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach</em>'s galaxy, and each will play "a crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness of your fleets, armies, and industries", according to Miller and Stelleas.</p>

<p><em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>will also be taking place across "a fully 3D starfield", although whether or not that means the game will feature&nbsp;<em>Homeworld</em>-style Z-axis combat remains to be seen. I, for one, sure hope so.</p>




<p>It's fair to say the 4X space sim market isn't exactly barren; games like&nbsp;<em>Master of Orion</em>,&nbsp;<em>Galactic Civilization</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Endless Space&nbsp;</em>remain hugely popular among their fanbases, so Miller and Stelleas have some work to do if they want to dominate this particular galaxy.</p>

<p>We'll get to find out whether he can achieve this goal when&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2578670/Stellar_Reach/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, apparently sometime in September. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tron-catalyst-review-rocky-revolution<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following up on 2023's visual novel&nbsp;<em>Tron: Identity</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tron: Catalyst&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mike-bithell-talks-about-his-dream-star-trek-game" rel="nofollow">Bithell Games</a>' sophomore outing with the franchise. In this more ambitious game, the team delivers a more direct experience, complete with the action fans expect, with both disc-to-disc combat and light cycle riding. However, this broadening of focus makes it much different than its predecessor-- for better and worse.</p>

<h2><em>TRON: Catalyst</em> - A New Identity</h2>



<p>The biggest change from the previous&nbsp;<em>Tron&nbsp;</em>game to this one is the shift from a relatively hands-off visual novel to a more isometric action-oriented approach. This was a change that I felt would really benefit the game. I really enjoyed my time with&nbsp;<em>Identity</em>, but it was hard to push how fun riding a light cycle would be out of my mind.</p>

<p>Luckily,&nbsp;<em>Catalyst&nbsp;</em>delivers the power fantasy that&nbsp;<em>Tron&nbsp;</em>fans would want, from disc-to-disc combat to light cycle riding. Unfortunately, the delivery of this new direction is one of the weaker parts of the game. Watching the game seems like it would deliver, but the reality was a little more clunky.</p>

<p>The bulk of the combat revolves around attacking with one button, and a parry and dodge. There are some additional techniques that unlock as well. The most fun ends up being throwing your disc, which can bounce between enemies and even yourself as it upgrades.</p>

<p>The one button that you end up needing, though, is the parry button. As you upgrade the skill tree, this parry becomes far too overtuned. While playing on the hardest difficulty, I managed to defeat the final boss with a single parry. To have any challenge, it felt like I had to purposely fight with one hand behind my back.</p>

<p>In addition to combat on Exo's feet, she utilizes her light cycle. One of the most iconic parts of the&nbsp;<em>Tron&nbsp;</em>mythos, the light cycle delivers on what you would want from it. It can feel a little clunky to use in crowded streets, but it shines in open areas. Derezzing enemies with its ribbon was one of the most fun things to do during my time in the Grid.</p>

<h2><em>TRON: Catalyst</em> - Grid Greatness</h2>



<p>Speaking of the Grid, the world of it is the most compelling part of the game. After proving itself with its isolated Repository area in&nbsp;<em>Tron: Identity</em>, Bithell Games has created a fully realized Grid that feels right at home in the franchise.</p>

<p>The characters that populate the Grid are a bit part of this. Exo herself is compelling enough, but the real standout for me was Conn, one of the antagonists in the game. Seeing him develop was one of my main motivators for continuing to see the story through.</p>

<p>The Automata faction's return was another highlight of this iteration of the Grid. The way they challenge the status quo of the world in&nbsp;<em>Tron: Catalyst&nbsp;</em>is one I found myself invested in. It helps that their pink and white color scheme absolutely shines in the world.</p>

<p>One of the lacking parts of the world was its exploration aspects. It's always easy to find where you're going, but I never felt the motivation to explore the previous areas with new abilities as I got them. These paths mostly only led to skill points, which I felt&nbsp;<em>Catalyst&nbsp;</em>was already incredibly generous with.</p>

<h2>TRON: Catalyst - Glitching Pains</h2>



<p>One of the biggest gripes that developed for me as I played was the Glitch, a mechanic introduced that allows Exo to repeat a cycle to make different decisions. The thought of this system excited me, as the branching paths of&nbsp;<em>Identity&nbsp;</em>were arguably its strongest suit.</p>

<p>This looping, unfortunately, ended up being mostly a letdown. While it gets a little more open later on, it begins feeling like a chore to extend certain sections.</p>

<p>In addition, going back to change certain decisions was fun, but almost never seemed to have the sort of butterfly effect that I wanted. I repeated decisions with a character to try and help them the best I could, only to never have a meaningful interaction with them again.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was also plagued by actual glitches alongside the Glitch mechanic. Frequently, when throwing my disc, it could get stuck, especially on narrow paths. This inconsistency ended up leading me right back to that powerful parry, just to get through the combat, instead of getting more creative.</p>

<h2><em>TRON: Catalyst</em> - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Tron: Catalyst&nbsp;</em>is a largely uneven experience. It has some great highs, especially in the worldbuilding and story departments. However, the gameplay can be largely uneven and even frustrating at times. Tron fans are sure to have a lot of fun with the story and even the gameplay, despite my hangups.</p>

<p>With this and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review-one-man-army" rel="nofollow">Strange Scaffold's <em>Ninja Turtles</em> game</a>, it's been fun to see IP owners loosen the grip on certain franchises. Despite my complaints, I do really hope that Bithell Games gets to finish what seems to be a planned trilogy of games. The bones of a great game are here. I would love to see where this story goes and ends. I just hope that the journey to find that answer is a lot more fun next time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battle Train Review - Fear of Flying]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battle-train-review-fear-of-flying</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battle-train-review-fear-of-flying.1220562/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battle-train-review-fear-of-flying<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An unsung guilty pleasure of mine is the secret stress test known as <em>Train Valley</em>. A jaunty little jog through the legacy of locomotives that quickly becomes the most intense experience you’ll have next to open heart surgery. Sometimes, however, a more direct approach is required, which is why <em>Battle Train</em> is here to dismantle all this complexity of train travel.</p>

<p>This is the latest release from Terrible Posture Games, a rather underseen developer in the grand scheme of things, with titles like <em>Tower of Guns</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mothergunship-review-fire-and-forget" rel="nofollow"><em>MOTHERGUNSHIP</em></a> under their belt. After a successful Kickstarter campaign to start things off, <em>Battle Train</em> sees Terrible Posture still scratching that roguelite itch, with help from co-developers Nerd Ninjas – who’ve helped Niantic out with their AR titles <em>Peridot Beyond</em> and <em>Pokemon Go</em> – and publishing help from none other than Bandai Namco.</p>

<p>You play as a contestant on the show viewed by “10 billion people” (the figures are real, trust), Battle Train, a <em>Takeshi’s Castle</em>-esque game show filled with explosions, a lively host, and a worthy final villain in the form of Supreme President Conductor Aalvado. Through the framing device of a fly-on-the-wall documentary detailing inner turmoil and office politics, you’ll slowly uncover a web of network shenanigans, celebrity ego, and image sacrificed for ratings… while also smashing trains into each other.</p>



<p>There’s a lot going on here, from the narrative which is implemented into story events you can run into on the world map, to the fusion of deck-building roguelite and board game. It’s easy to consider it blind ambition, or blind anything, since everything is on-the-spot; who your opponent is, what events you’ll run into, etc. There's not a lot of prediction in <em>Battle Train</em>, only the next stop, which may be your last.</p>

<p>Gameplay consists of you and your opponent taking turns on a board to build tracks into each other's outposts, so you can slam trains from your base into them for damage. There are energy deposits in the form of scattered minerals and mines placed on the map, so you have to balance between wanting your opponent to lose and generating an economy to realize that objective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another rule is that both you and your opponent should be able to use the same tracks, should they both connect to your stations, something which is just as prosperous as it is dangerous. Place a few obstacle generation cards and alternative methods of damage, and you should have a charismatic mix of chess by way of <em>Under Siege 2</em>, right?</p>



<p>Almost, but not quite. Since it’s a deck builder, there’s still a lot in the way of the type of build you can, could, and <em>should </em>generate, as well as prospects in the form of upgrading your train. Extra minerals, extra gold, more health, etc. – it all takes further priority than what you want your deck to achieve. Regardless of which direction you take, there will be certain patches of dead air in battle where you and your opponent will simply end turns until you can accrue the cards you need.</p>

<p>Indeed, a lot of the train upgrades are where you’ll find your muscle in battle, leading to some exceptionally one-sided affairs of runs. That isn’t to say that <em>Battle Train</em> can’t generate some exciting and tense battles later down the line, once you unlock more cards, upgrades, and understanding of your fairly small but varied roster of opponents. As it stands, though, a fat handful of your victories will lie in whether or not you can summon a lucky enough upgrade in the initial stretch.</p>

<p>A disappointing prospect to consider, especially when fighting tooth and nail to survive, is where <em>Battle Train</em> absolutely shines. Find yourself down and out, one hit away from death, and turn meek retreat into a cartridge trap of sudden connections to your enemy outposts, as your railway starts connecting to theirs, and now there’s a long train comin’. It’s a rare sight, but when tactical fortitude is what wins you a run in <em>Battle Train</em>, you will not stop beaming for a while after the run.</p>



<p>Also, in a rather deflating decision, there’s no PvP element for you to face your friends… what gives? In its peaks, <em>Battle Train</em> absolutely taps into the same vein of silliness and teeth-clenching moments that something like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/worms-wmd-review-worm-has-returned" rel="nofollow">Worms</a> </em>would provide, so it’s disappointing to see that, eventually, you will run into a brick wall in terms of what <em>Battle Train</em> can provide for you.</p>

<p>Part of me believes Terrible Posture are aware of this, which is why they put all their chips on providing a rather hefty narrative to go alongside the gameplay, a brave decision for a roguelite. You could ignore it entirely, but you’d be remiss of a rather delicate writing affair that’s trying to juggle childish endeavors with an almost adult flavor. It’s not some secret genius theory like, I dunno, “The Sinister Undertones of <em>Bluey</em>” or what-have-you, it’s more that <em>Battle Train</em> wants to convince you of its writing chops.</p>

<p>It certainly convinced me. Every time it got a bit too cynical or saccharine to deal with, it turned right back around into being absorbing, if not charismatic. This is thanks to some well-done characterization in the form of Aalvado, and the stupidly adorable Todrick the Turtle, as well as knowing when and where to let a joke lie. Even with a lacking cast, <em>Battle Train</em> grows a lot from a little, and it was worth it to play the game just to see the next cutscene, which feels weird to say, right?</p>

<p>Still, that’s my opinion, and not everyone wants the promise of smashing trains into buildings to be uprooted by <em>30 Rock</em> meets <em>The Crystal Maze</em>. You can still go through <em>Battle Train</em> and completely ignore the story it presents, but it’s there to consider why, at times, the gameplay and its mechanical opportunities might feel blunt, or even stodgy. Is it still fun? Absolutely, but this isn’t chess we’re talking about here. Not even checkers… tiddlywinks, maybe.</p>



<h2><em>Battle Train&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>When it works, <em>Battle Train</em> is ingenious, sharp, and oddly alluring with the twists and turns it presents, and when it doesn’t work, you still have what is essentially an outrageously silly board game. It’s not got the depth to match your favorites, but it has the passion, the charm, and the wits to know it’s better to go for broke with a blunderbuss. I certainly know one thing, though.</p>

<p>This is a no-Todrick-slander zone from now on.</p>
