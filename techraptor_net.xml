            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week we were <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-spider-man-secret-lair-swings-by-providing-six-sensational-drops" rel="nofollow">treated to news</a> that the next Secret Lair would be <em>Spider-Man</em> themed and we got to check out the<em> Daily Bugle Breaking News</em> drop. At the time, we were teased with six total drops coming but just shown the one. Now we can reveal them all. They all release September 22nd.</p>

<p>Heroes and villains are at the core of any superhero story, and that is exactly where these drops take us. First, let's take a look at some heroes.</p>

<h2>Secret Lair x Marvel's Spider-Man: Heroic Deeds</h2>

<p>A big theme with the overall set of <em>Spider-Man</em>, the art in this drop absolutely pops. All of the artists have backgrounds working as artists for Marvel, like Todd Nauck, Elena Casagrtande, Lucas Wernack, and Swayart.</p>

<p>Here's the list of cards in <em>Heroic Deeds</em>:</p>

<ul><li>Command Tower</li>
	<li>Ephemerate</li>
	<li>Lightning Greaves</li>
	<li>Sol Ring</li>
	<li>Three Visits</li>
</ul><p>All of these should be familiar and are classic cards that see a lot of play. Now they just get the <em>Spider-Man</em> hero treatment.</p>

<p>The non-foil version is $29.99 and the rainbow foil is $39.99.</p>

<h2>Secret Lair x Marvel's Spider-Man: Villainous Plots</h2>

<p>You may see some of the same cards here as in <em>Heroic Deeds</em>, as this drop is meant to complement the <em>Heroic Deeds</em> drop. They both share Command Tower, Lightning Greaves, and Sol Ring. There's a couple of new ones though, and all feature classic <em>Spider-Man</em> villains.</p>

<p>As before, they all feature art from Marvel artists like Todd Nauck, Terry Dodson, Roberta Ingranata, and Kael Ngu.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the cards in <em>Villainous Plots</em>:</p>

<ul><li>Command Tower</li>
	<li>Deadly Dispute</li>
	<li>Go for the Throat</li>
	<li>Lightning Greaves</li>
	<li>Sol Ring</li>
</ul><p>As mentioned, three we've seen before with two new classic cards.</p>

<p>The non-foil version is $29.99 and the rainbow foil is $39.99.</p>

<h2>Secret Lair x Marvel's Spider-Man: Venom Unleashed (Colors)</h2>

<p>You were probably thinking, how the heck was Venom not with the villain drop? Well, Venom is such a big and popular villain that he will feature in not just this drop, but the final three.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This drop features art from Mark Bagley, the artist behind one of the most popular runs of <em>Spider-Man</em> of all time, <em>Ultimate Spider-Man</em>. Obviously, he's no stranger to Spider-Man or Venom, and may just be the perfect choice for this drop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is a list of the cards in <em>Venom Unleashed (Colors)</em>:</p>

<ul><li>Damnation</li>
	<li>Dark Ritual</li>
	<li>Peer Into the Abyss</li>
	<li>Surgical Extraction</li>
	<li>Tendrils of Agony</li>
</ul><p>This list of cards include some of the most iconic black cards of all-time with some of the coolest art they've ever been in as well.</p>

<p>The non-foil version is $29.99 and the rainbow foil is $39.99.</p>

<h2>Secret Lair x Marvel's Spider-Man: Venom Unleashed (Inks)</h2>

<p>This drop features the exact same cards and art as the previous drop but is just the inks, not colored in. Here you can see the crisp linework of Mark Bagley before the colors are added.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the cards for <em>Venom Unleashed (Inks)</em>:</p>

<ul><li>Damnation</li>
	<li>Dark Ritual</li>
	<li>Peer Into the Abyss</li>
	<li>Surgical Extraction</li>
	<li>Tendrils of Agony</li>
</ul><p>The non-foil version is $29.99 and the rainbow foil is $39.99.</p>

<h2>Secret Lair x Marvel's Spider-Man: Mana Symbiote</h2>

<p>Finally, Venom has taken over some basic lands that feature mana symbol for the various lands.</p>

<p>Now, these cards I have seen and held in-person. The photos above do not do them justice. When we were shown them, the Secret Lair team mentioned the treatments on these cards are some of the most complicated they've done to create a unique effect. Parts of the card are raised black symbiote tendrils are shiny, popping out amazingly. They are extremely visually striking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is what you get in<em> Mana Symbiote:</em></p>

<ul><li>2x Forest</li>
	<li>2x Island</li>
	<li>2x Mountain</li>
	<li>2x Plains</li>
	<li>2x Swamp</li>
</ul><p>The set includes two of each basic land. They are only available in the raised foil version and cost $59.99.</p>

<hr><p>With that, those are all of the drops for the Spider-Man Secret Lair. Will you be trying to pick any of them up?</p>
