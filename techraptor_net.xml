            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced that its&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>-themed fighting game&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>is getting a closed beta later this year, and a new champion has been announced for the roster as well.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/2xko-closedbeta-announcement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the game's official website, <i>2XKO</i>'s closed beta begins on September 9th, and Riot says that once the beta is online, its "goal is to keep the game online, outside of any necessary maintenance". That means there won't be any downtime; once you're in, you're in.</p>

<p>However, this does also mean that&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>'s closed beta will only be available for PC, so if you're hoping to check the game out on consoles, you'll have to wait a while, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/2xko-closed-beta-vi-illaoi.jpg?itok=Ny8DU7MY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/2xko-closed-beta-vi-illaoi.jpg?itok=Ijwjn5Pd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>is getting a closed beta later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The silver lining here, however, is that&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>will support cross-progression, so if you get started in the closed beta on PC, you'll still be able to transfer whatever progress you make to your preferred version when it launches.</p>

<p>To get a chance to check out the closed beta, you can <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/beta/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sign up here</a>. If you participated in either of&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>'s Alpha Lab tests, then you're already signed up for the closed beta and you can just wait for your confirmation email.</p>

<p>As well as announcing the closed beta, Riot also revealed a new champion for the game's roster in the form of the Piltover enforcer Vi. Given that she fights with a massive pair of gauntlets, she's pretty much a no-brainer for&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>.</p>

<p>Vi's trailer reveals her to be a powerful and fearsome combatant, and her design looks like it's somewhere in between the original&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>look and the newer&nbsp;<em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>aesthetic. You can check out her trailer here.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>is, it's a&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>&nbsp;fighting game that features champions from the MOBA's roster duking it out in two-on-two combat.</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-project-l-gameplay-details-revealed-by-riot" rel="nofollow">designated&nbsp;<em>Project L</em></a>, the game was subsequently renamed to&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is" rel="nofollow">in February last year</a>. It doesn't have a release date yet, but its PC closed beta begins on September 9th, and it's also set to land on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S when it launches in full.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em> is one of my go-to games for replayability. With so many haunts, variability in gameplay, and even the way that a house develops differently sitting down you've always got to be prepared for something new. With the <em>Betrayal At The Niebolt House: The Evil of Pennywise</em> expansion, players get to take on the roles of a group returning after 27 years of torment to put a stop to Pennywise.</p>

<p>Included in the box you'll find a "Come Home To Evil" Scenario Card, ten Pennywise Encounter cards, four tokens, a Henry Bowers character overlay, and three IT-themed miniatures for Henry Bowers, Pennywise the Clown, and Pennywise the Spider. The expansion also includes four new rooms, a thematic story preamble for the Derry setting, and five new haunts inspired by <em>IT Chapter II.</em></p>

<p>Come Home To Evil<br>
You are a group of friends who survived It's last feeding frenzy in the town of Derry when you were kids. Now, It has stirred again after 27 years, and you've been drawn back to the Neibolt House to confront the savage shapeshifter. As you explore the house and experience nightmarish events, will you turn on your friends? Or will you band together to defeat It once and for all?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What is <em>Betrayal</em>?</h2>

<p>If you're new to <em>Betrayal</em>, the basic premise of it is that you and your group of explorers begin in the entrance hall of a mysterious mansion. As you take turns, you'll enter rooms and flip over tiles from a large stack of rooms, building the house as you play the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-mansion-building.jpg?itok=1snp6sUF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-mansion-building.jpg?itok=_Le6PjM6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Exploring the house, you'll have a chance to earn items, experience strange and supernatural events, and discover ominous Omens. Once enough Omens have been gathered, a Haunt kicks off.</p>

<p>Once the Haunt kicks off, you're no longer playing a collaborative game of haunted house exploration, but instead, one (or maybe more) of the players will turn to the side of evil. They may have been killed, with the player now controlling monsters in the house, have become evil themselves, or some mix of the two.</p>

<p>Each team of players now has its own unique goals to win the game as new mechanics come into play.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-separated-house.jpg?itok=t5Y-qPok 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-separated-house.jpg?itok=0aHkYeCG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With <em>The Evil of Pennywise</em>, there are a number of changes made to the base game so that no matter what, you always feel like you're part of the universe of IT.</p>

<p>The largest critique of <em>Betrayal: The Evil of Pennywise</em>&nbsp;is also one that it shares with the base game, as you move into the Haunt and there's a chance for players to die if things go awry and if you die quickly, then you're fully out of the game. When these haunts can take 30+ minutes, that's time that you're just not getting to engage in any aspect of the game.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Betrayal At The Neibolt House</h2>

<p>In order to adapt your game to fit the theme of the expansion, you'll get to add your four new tiles to the game board. From there, you'll start your game as normal with the expansion-specific scenario card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-pennywise-encounters.jpg?itok=tR291cYU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-pennywise-encounters.jpg?itok=UVru6pKT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The largest change is that instead of pulling Omen cards when you see an Omen symbol on a revealed room, you'll instead pull a Pennywise Encounter card. These cards pull inspiration from the source material, where you'll see a red balloon pop and potentially take damage, or overcoming floating lights is able to help you gain sanity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The four new room tiles are unique to the expansion, but that doesn't mean that they can't be staples of your standard Betrayal experience</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing that a few new tiles are in the deck, and you're pulling Pennywise Encounters instead of Omens, is really all you need to change going into <em>The Evil of Pennywise,</em> making setup an incredibly fast process and for it to be familiar for all returning players.</p>

<h2>Experiencing The Haunts</h2>

<p>Discussing the haunts can be a bit difficult without spoiling too much, so I'll keep it generic here for a bit. There are five themed Haunts in <em>The Evil of Pennywise</em>, each focusing on a key plotpoint from IT Chapter II, whether it be facing Henry Bowers, or facing off against Pennywise The Clown itself.</p>

<p>The game has done a fantastic job of adapting these scenes to best fit the gameplay of <em>Betrayal</em>, with Haunt number 2 in this book probably becoming my favorite Betrayal experience with a great mix of unique gameplay, interesting problems to solve, and a very visible threat continuing to grow until it becomes too much for any player to handle.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-henry-bowers.jpg?itok=t_Lg9Jpl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-henry-bowers.jpg?itok=YTlEemWv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To get deeper into the spoilers, each of the different haunts progresses you further through the narrative of the source material. Starting by having to fight Henry Bowers, then getting trapped in a disconnected house, having to find your artifacts, and then performing the ritual and taking on Pennywise.</p>

<p>It almost feels like there should be a recommended goal to build the house, but make alterations so you can do each of the haunts in order to create a legacy game feel as you and your friends make it through the events of <em>IT Chapter 2</em>.</p>

<p>To cap off the experience, I'm a big fan of the final two haunts of the game having no traitor, but Pennywise be an mechanic-driven antagonist. It stays true to the source material while also creating a very unifying experience for the players.</p>

<p>If there was ever a board game to use the IP of <em>IT</em> and Pennywise, <em>Betrayal </em>is the perfect choice. This expansion is incredibly fast to setup, enhances the base game, and allows for you and your friends to experience a variety of mechanically unique haunts.</p>

<p>While only adding five new haunts, this won't take long to get through; each of the haunts is very unique and memorable to the source material.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of <em>Betrayal</em>, there's really no way that more haunts are ever going to be a bad thing, this should be a must buy.</p>
