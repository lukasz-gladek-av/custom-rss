            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Sega and developer Two Point Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds</em>, the first major DLC expansion for museum management sim&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum</em>, and it's heading your way next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://community.twopointcounty.com/two-point-studios/two-point-museum/blogs/89-two-point-museum-fantasy-finds-coming-17th-july" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum&nbsp;</em>site,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds&nbsp;</em>will launch on July 17th across all platforms on which the game is currently available, and it'll bring a ton of extra stuff for you to enjoy, all of it fantasy-themed.</p>

<p>First off, you can look forward to 40 new exhibits "with magical properties to hypnotize guests with", and that's not necessarily a figure of speech, either. You'd better watch your guests around some of the more esoteric oddments.</p>

<p>More interactive displays will also be introduced in the DLC, as well as a new helicopter paint job and three new guest archetypes for you to keep happy. You'd better make sure they don't get hypnotized!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum</em>, it's a management sim, and you'll never guess what you get to manage. That's right: your very own aquarium. The clue's in the name, I guess.</p>

<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-point-museum-release-date" rel="nofollow">back in March</a>, Two Point Studios' latest lets you manage a museum, oversee its exhibits, and try to keep its guests happy, all while acquiring your own artifacts and trying to thwart the efforts of enterprising thieves.</p>




<p>The game is the latest management sim from Two Point Studios, who, as the name suggests, can also count <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/check-into-two-point-hospital-on-august-30" rel="nofollow">2018's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/check-into-two-point-hospital-on-august-30" rel="nofollow">Two Point Hospital</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-point-campus-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">2022's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-point-campus-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">Two Point Campus</a>&nbsp;</em>as feathers in their cap.</p>

<p><em>Two Point Museum</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds&nbsp;</em>DLC launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3592600/Two_Point_Museum_Fantasy_Finds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on July 17th, and the base game is currently available on all of those platforms as well.</p>
