            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em>&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy </em>was already known to be the best selling set of all time, but new statements from Hasbro in their financial reporting reveal the staggering degree of which this is the case.</p>

<p>During the earning call Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks opened up saying that&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>&nbsp;was up 23% year over year, and up 32% year to date, foreshadowing the crazy numbers yet to come. When answering a question, Cocks revealed that&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Ranking ALL of Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Legendary Creatures Part 1"><em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>(and its hoard of legendary creatures)</a> had sold as much in one day, as previous best selling set&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings - Tales of Middle-Earth</em>&nbsp;did in 6 months.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In terms of Final Fantasy, and how it met expectations, I'll give you a comparison between two of our biggest Universes Beyond sets. Lord of the Rings took 6 months to deliver $200 million of revenue, Final Fantasy took 1 day, and we left demand on the table. So we couldn't produce enough. I think we increased production runs on it 4x pre release. It was substantially by many, many very high double-digit percentages ahead of any other production run we've ever done, and we left the market wanting more." (Transcript from <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4803536-hasbro-inc-has-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript">Seeking Alpha</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite that huge sales, and increasing production of <em>Magic: The Gathering -&nbsp;</em><em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>4 separate times, they still were unable to meet the demand that brought over $200m in sales on day 1. That $200m in revenue was a large part of the Wizards and Digital gaming revenue segment which was $522m.</p>

<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> Isn't the Only Set Doing Big Numbers</h2>

<p>Of course, if the only strong numbers were related to&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;it would be somewhat concerning. That isn't the case, as in his prepared comments Cocks revealed that&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/tarkir-dragonstorm-commander-deck-reviews" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Tarkir: Dragonstorm Commander Deck Reviews - Roaring Fun!"><em>Tarkir - Dragonstorm</em>&nbsp;</a>is on pace to become the best selling in-universe premiere&nbsp;set (aka standard legal, and not a&nbsp;<em>Modern Horizons</em>&nbsp;type set) of all time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Player count in organized play was also up substantially, with a 40% increase in unique players taking part in events as Universes Beyond manages to attract both new and old players to the game. This was also buoyed by&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>as it "set a record for new player growth, delivering more new players in its first 2 weeks than any prior set posted over an entire season," <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/005be71f-0c3f-4e8a-800e-06ecd698c19c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hasbro Investor Prepared Remarks">according to Cocks</a>.</p>

<p>Older cards are selling too. Despite half the year left to go,&nbsp;<em>Magic</em>'s backlist of sets has already set an all-time annual record of sales as of the end of June. This is partially powered by sets like&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings - Tales of Middle-Earth</em>, but also by sets like&nbsp;<em>Modern Horizons 3</em>, and&nbsp;other in-universe sets that continue to sell even more to more players. As for Secret Lair, the controversial decision to go back to limited print runs has not harmed sales at all as it has just delivered its strongest sales quarter in its history, possibly powered by the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-releasing-three-secret-lair-x-final-fantasy-drops-this-summer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Wizards of the Coast Releasing Three Secret Lair x Final Fantasy Drops This Summer"><em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>Secret Lairs</a>.</p>

<p>All in all,&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>'s finances are booming right now, and it's good to be Hasbro, who is able to lean on Wizards of the Coast while various toys experience more difficulties with tariffs due to components coming from regions that are heavily tariffed often.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Game Manufacturers Association (GAMA) is entering its second lawsuit against the Trump Administration. The lawsuit involves the new wave of emergency tariffs being imposed by the US President, which would pose an existential crisis to the entire tabletop industry.</p>



<p>In a report by Board Game Wire, GAMA is joining the cookware manufacturer Firedisc and timber supplier Ryan Wholesale for a new lawsuit against the Trump Administration in response to its <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/07/economy/trump-letters-tariffs" rel="nofollow">recent sweeping emergency tariffs</a>. These new tariffs are imposing a price increase of anywhere between 10-20% on goods coming from multiple countries around the world, including Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and others.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gama-john-stacy-profile-photo.jpg?itok=aSnvWSwy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gama-john-stacy-profile-photo.jpg?itok=Uf2z7j_Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In many ways, this lawsuit may invoke a sense of deja vu on the part of GAMA. When the Trump Administration provoked a trade war with China, imposing tariffs on import costs, it was a devastating blow to the entire tabletop industry. One GAMA spent months of hard work trying to overturn.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it was a decision that came with its share of industry casualties. CMON has <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ceased development</a> and has had to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-acquires-zombicide-ip-from-board-game-publisher-cmon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some of its IPs</a> to keep the lights on. <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/boardlandia-shuts-down-due-to-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boardlandia</a> shut their doors.</p>

<p>The difference between the previous lawsuit and the new lawsuit is in scale. The first lawsuit pertained to Chinese imports only, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">still devastating</a> to the industry as a whole. These new tariffs by comparison, are a lot broader and far more devastating across multiple businesses and industries.</p>

<p>GAMA has stated that this lawsuit is about more than just the long-term health of the tabletop industry. Much like the first string of tariffs, these are being imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which allows the President to impose trade tariffs without approval of Congress while in states of emergency.</p>

<p>Since a state of emergency hasn't been declared, or the rationale to impose such a state is dubious at best, this would mean the President has unilaterally imposed these devastating tariffs without any Congressional approval or oversight.</p>

<p>This is the key argument of GAMA's second anti-tariff lawsuit. It invokes the US Supreme Court's Major Questions Doctrine, emphasizing that major policy changes require Congressional approval and that IEEPA does not provide such unilateral action. It is not just about economic fairness, but about restoring constitutional order.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“GAMA strongly supports this lawsuit as a critical effort to restore constitutional oversight of trade and tariffs.</p>

<p>“These emergency tariff orders are economically damaging and threatens tens of thousands of jobs in our industry that relies on international manufacturing and cooperation.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This new lawsuit was officially filed on July 21 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas</p>
