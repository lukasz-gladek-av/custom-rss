            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/riverbank-rpg-brings-cozy-animal-whimsy-to-gaming-tables<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kobold Press has announced a new TTRPG. The tabletop studio, known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 5e supplements and their original fantasy RPG <em>Tales of the Valiant</em>, is launching a campaign for <em>Riverbank</em> RPG, a more cozy experience with talking animals and whimsy.</p>

<h2>The <em>Riverbank</em> RPG Announcement</h2>

<p>In a report <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/kobold-press-announces-cosy-rpg-riverbank.711779/" rel="nofollow">by EN World</a>, the <em>Riverbank</em> RPG involves you playing as a member of a society of anthropomorphic animals. Their concerns aren't life and death but of cake and teatime by the slow part of the river. It is a cottagecore experience that is less <em>Redwall</em> and more <em>The Wind in the Willows</em>.</p>

Players can weave farcical fables or dramatic tales of elegant animals on curious quests, navigate polite Animal society, and weather the unique dynamics of life. Challenges or tensions may include attending tea parties, dancing at fancy balls, and dodging difficult relatives.</p>

<p>Since the focus is more on social navigation than swords and magic, the <em>Riverbank</em> RPG will utilize an original TTRPG system. Three to five players use D4s, D6s, and D12s to resolve decisions. In addition, they must manage their characters' Animality and Poetry sides. If you fall too far one particular side, disaster may soon follow.</p>

<p>The <em>Riverbank</em> RPG was created and written by the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author Kij Johnson, the same creative mind behind <em>Ponies</em> and<em> The Fox Woman</em>. In addition, the RPG features the work of British Fantasy Award and World Fantasy Award-winning artist Kathleen Jennings.</p>

<p>Given Kobold Press' clear stances <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kobold-press-ceo-says-no-to-generative-ai" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">against generative AI</a>, their support of these acclaimed creatives showcases their dedication to artistic projects created with human hands.</p>

<p>According to its <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/67b1a3f2-6637-4c01-a5d3-bd3f22b78591/landing" rel="nofollow">Backerkit page</a>, the <em>Riverbank</em> RPG crowdfunding campaign will go live on March 31. At the time of writing, there are no further details regarding pledge levels, add-ons, or additional books or supplements.</p>
