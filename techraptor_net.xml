            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr"><em>Gladlands </em>is the latest <em>Dimension 20</em> adventure to hit Dropout. Functioning as a spin on a post-apocalyptic adventure where everyone is nice and trying to help out one another instead of fighting over resources, think of it as the most wholesome <em>Mad Max</em> spinoff you've ever seen.</p><p dir="ltr">Going on this adventure are <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/ify-nwadiwe-and-jacob-wysocki-chat-never-stop-blowing-up-being-new-at-table-and" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b02fe4e6-1370-402b-a680-949a73bfa736" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Jacob Wysocki</a>, Oscar Montoya, Vic Michaelis, and Kimia Behpoornia, among others. Midway through the season, TechRaptor was able to sit down and hear from these performers about what piqued their interest in the project, how they created their unique characters, and what role they think they'd have in the post-apocalypse.</p><p dir="ltr">Starting at the beginning, I asked each how they were approached for the project and what made them say yes. Montoya started "The pitch was essentially, this is a post-apocalyptic world, but instead of devolving into chaos, it's what happens if a caravan of people decide to spread positivity and joy."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Joining The <em>Gladlands </em>Caravan</h2><p dir="ltr">At first, Montoya was in, but when it was revealed who else would be joining the cast, it became a much more enticing offer.</p><p dir="ltr">"Oh, you mean all of my favorite people in the whole wide world? Well, of course I'm in."</p><p dir="ltr">For Wysocki, he explained that <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Brennan Lee Mulligan </a>"hit him with the math," and while he understood the idea, it wasn't fully clicking. "These are two entities that I recognize," those entities being: <em>Mad Max</em> and 'being nice,' "and I know there's a place where they meet, but it didn't immediately click. It required me probably asking fifteen minutes of questions, but Brennan had it all locked and loaded because he's fucking Brennan, and I see the needle we're trying to thread."</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">This idea of excitement to play in a game with all of your friends was a sentiment shared by Michaelis and Behpoornia. They shared their story in tandem, first with Michaelis rejecting the idea before learning who would be on it.</p><p dir="ltr">"David Kerns hopped on a call and said 'literally all of your best friends are going to be here, and it's <em>Gladlands</em>, it's going to be post-apocalyptic like Mad Max but things are better.'" From there, Michaelis texted Behpoornia to confirm.</p><p dir="ltr">"I got an email and I was like 'hmm, I want to do it but maybe I should wait it out' and then I got a text from Vic being like 'hey, are you doing this D20, I got all the information, here's everyone who's gonna be there, here's what's going to happen…' and I was like Oh great, somebody got all the info, somebody I really trust and then it was just all my friends there at the table."</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"There was all my friends there, that's kind of all I needed… they should have led with that" - Behpoornia on accepting a role in <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em></p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Talking further about having so many friends at the table, Michaelis added, "So much of improv is about the chemistry that you have with people. It's something that we deal with all the time in Very Important People, when you already have that base shared language it's way easier to jump into something, and you get to places that you never would have known before."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">Choosing A Post-Apocalyptic Character</h2><p dir="ltr">In this future setting, each performer has created a truly one-of-a-kind character. Wysocki roleplays as KoKoMo, a nine-foot-tall hairy 'snorlaxian, totoroian' character. Montoya is a drag queen, Poppy Persona, Michaelis is a pale corvid-cosplaying mortician, Hugi, and Behpoornia is a normal human man with a 20-pack abs and a cockroach head.</p><p dir="ltr">For inspiration on KoKoMo Wysocki, "his head first went to the 'glad' side of things. I thought about childcare and how these communities, other than western society, raise children and pod them together and there's more of a community effort to look after people than a nuclear family. Then I went to the <em>Mad Max</em> side of things and thought 'what would mutate into that?' and I started to think of a big round couch boy."&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"Then I think I rewatched <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> just for vibes, and I was like yeah, this is that" - Wysocki on creating Kokomo</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Poppy Persona takes inspiration from Aunt Entity, Tina Turner's character in <em>Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome,</em> mixed with Montoya's real-life experience as the Drag Queen Ozma. "When Brennan gave the premise, my immediate reaction was 'Oh! Tina Turner in Beyond Thunderdome' and to me I've always seen Aunt Entity as a Drag Queen because she has to be this larger than life personality to run the Thunderdome."</p><p dir="ltr">"I was like, 'What would my character's Thunderdome be?' and it would be like Drag Queen Story Hour. So that's where the character of Poppy Persona was created."</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-poppy.jpg?itok=AgchLUFb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1919" height="1079">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-poppy.jpg?itok=2DChsHcy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I did ask if there were any other Drag Queen influences that he was drawing on, but Montoya explained, "No, I tried to stay away from any existing Drag Artist. They're all incredible artists."</p><p dir="ltr">Behpoornia's approach was to start with one idea and then iterate upon it. "When I heard it was post-apocalyptic, I thought cockroaches survive that long, it usually helps me in brainstorming when I trust my first idea and then go deeper into that."</p><p dir="ltr">"So then I went, 'how do I make this matter?', if it has survived this long, it's probably a lonely guy, and if it's part of a caravan going around to communities being used for the ability that it can't die, then how does that feel? Does he feel used in that way? It's also such a big idea, I wanted to make any lesson he learned kinda bite sized, so I made him a dumb guy, so everything he experiences, he can sum up the way a kid might."</p><p dir="ltr">For Hugi, Michaelis's inspiration was in the pages of the book <em>From Here To Eternity</em>, "which is about cultural death practices and things that are unique to different cultures, and it really took it from an anthropological standpoint. It made grief a lot more accessible. It was interesting exploring the way a community deals with death, especiallyone &nbsp;that has been ravaged and was one generation away from this mass extinction event."</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-hugi.jpg?itok=9v2P88ct 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1919" height="1076">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-hugi.jpg?itok=nbVDDOyu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="673">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">"People are still going to die in the <em>Gladlands </em>and the way that we as a society handle death is really important because it's very indicative of the type of society that we live in and so having someone around that's going to treat that with care and respect and to make the people going through that feel seen and honored I think is important to a healthy society. But it's also a job that people don't want to do, so what does the guy who does that look like?"</p><p dir="ltr">As each character could have their own mutations for different body parts, and other irregularities, I was interested to know if that made the character creation process easier or more difficult to nail down a character design. Wysocki explained it was quite the opposite, "It's sort of an easy out in the sense that you can just say 'well, I just mutated that way,' you can't argue with that. It does give you a lot of freedom, so much freedom that somebody's dad could be a motorcycle."</p><p dir="ltr">"Or that you can be the hottest bodied person ever and have the body of a bug" Montoya added, referencing Behpoornia's Tess Tube5.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">First And Second Times In The Dome</h2><p dir="ltr">Interestingly while <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em> is the 27th season of Dimension 20 for Wysocki and Montoya this was their second time in the Dome, and for Michaelis and Behpoornia it was their first. I was interested to know how it was coming back for the second time, as well as what they came away with from the experience if it was their first time on Dimension 20.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm more comfortable now, I'm not as intimidated by what the Dome is and how important it is to a lot of people," explained Wysocki "to be supported by very great people there was no way to lose."</p><p dir="ltr">Montoya echoed similar sentiments, "I felt super comfortable because I'd done it before, the first time I was learning how to play the game while I was playing it, but even when it had wildly different mechanics it was a lot easier for me to RP, and that was the easy part of it, AND I get to RP with my friends? Say less, I'm good."</p><p dir="ltr">For those new to the Dome they had experience in playing some home games "which were really fun, but I don't think necessarily prepared me for the amount that you have to be doing in the Dome when you're being filmed and recorded" Michaelis joked.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-table-reaction.jpg?itok=rzAtC7bF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1919" height="1079">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">"I also hadn't played very much," Behpoornia added "this is what I think all of them are and I'm hearing that it's kind of an outlier here because we're not doing much combat, big bads, magic spells, all of that. So if I had to go back and do something like that I'd be so confused."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Improv Bits In A Strange New World</h2><p dir="ltr">Watching <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em> the bits that the party make up and stick with are just as outlandish as the setting they're taking place in. Knowing that it was such a strange world it seemed like there was no limit to a punchline. Talking about the 'Yes, and' at the table Montoya jokes "I feared we did go too far."</p><p dir="ltr">"I was wondering 'is any of this usable? We're just having too good of a time riffing and doing bits. That's just a testament to the kind of storytelling ability the Brennan Lee Mulligan has, he was able to steer the ship when things were getting a little bit too chaotic. We also know when to lock in and when to be silly and goofy and stuff"</p><p dir="ltr">On the flip side Behpoornia mused that she didn't think there was any way to take it too far. "Just knowing the people that were there at the table, knowing that anything you did, even if it was crazy, nothing is a mess up. We could have done anything at the table because one, Brennan is such a big brain that's taking us through exactly what we need to do, and two, everyone else there we've known for years and have performed with so it's the safest space to do anything."</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">"I really believe that the only time you can mess up is when nobody is there to back you up," Michaelis added, "With a group like this it's never going to happen, there's going to be somebody who steps in. Even if it doesn't work, there's going to be four of you together"</p><h2 dir="ltr">What Would Your Job Be In The <em>Gladlands</em>?</h2><p dir="ltr">As our time wrapped up and we had finished discussing each characters role I was interested to pose to each of the cast members what role they think they would have in the Gladlands.</p><p dir="ltr">Montoya began "In the Gladlands I would like to think I'd be a Poppy Persona, that's why I created the character, yeah I think that's my answer."</p><p dir="ltr">Michaelis shared that they'd been "constantly threatening to go back to school to be an EMT or a nurse. I think that's probably what I would want to do. Weirdly, I think I'm quite good in hospitals or emergency situations. I'd need the training but I think in a situation like that where there's not TV I'd have a lot more time to focus on studying."</p><p dir="ltr">"I'd maybe want to do some job with the kids in the Gladlands because that just sounds really sweet," mused Behpoornia "It sounds like my level of how I would process living in the Gladlands. So to be someone who can help them process their play in the post-apocalypse sounds like a nice job to have."</p><p dir="ltr">To close us out Wysocki gave the short but sweet answer "I'm just not making it, nah nah nah I like accidentally shoot a president or something"</p><p dir="ltr">You can watch <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em> now on Dropout.tv, the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W63ILhEsvGY" rel="nofollow"> first episode is also available via the Dimension 20 Youtube channel.</a></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/dimension-20-gladlands-is-mad-max-if-everyone-wasnt-being-so-rude-interview]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devir Games has announced an <em>Ace of Spades</em> reboot. After pulling the game from sale after some controversial content, a revised version of the card game is coming this summer along with a new expansion.</p><h2>The <em>Ace of Spades</em> Reboot Announcement</h2><p>According to a report <a href="https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/61522/inappropriate-cards-removed-upcoming-reboot-ace-spades" rel="nofollow">by ICV2</a>, the <em>Ace of Spades</em> reboot will be hitting retail stores on May 2026. The game will be identical to its original release from Gen Con 2025, with some material removed.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ace-of-spades-reboot-call-of-the-zombie-box-art.jpg?itok=zHGVF4VG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="500" height="723">

  </picture><p>That removed material are several cards depicting the enslavement of African-Americans. Said cards depicted artwork of an enslaved African American and a slaver. According to the designers, the intention was to invoke the Quentin Tarentino western film <em>Django Unchained</em> with the cards. Instead, audiences saw the cards as trivializing the institution of slavery in the American Wild West.</p><p>Devir Games did issue an apology for these cards, stopped all sales of the game, had retail copies recalled, designed new cards to replace the controversial ones, and issued them free of charge.</p><p>Now with the <em>Ace of Spades</em> reboot, this revised version of the game is coming back. As our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/ace-of-space-review-shuffle-deal-draw" rel="nofollow">original review</a> mentioned, the game is a fun, Wild West spin on poker where winning, much like a gun duel, depends on the draw. The new version of the game will be sold at an MSRP of $24.99.</p><p>But this reboot isn't just a formal relaunch. Devir Games has also announced a new expansion for the game, <em>Ace of Spades: Call of the Zombie</em>. This expansion adds 15 new cards to the game, including zombie enemies and four versions of a boss zombie, called Hellbilly. Considering Rockstar Games' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/look-back-at-red-dead-redemptions-timeless-tale-of-john-marston" rel="nofollow"><em>Red Dead Redemption</em></a> and the TTRPG <em>Deadlands</em> have done this mash-up, it fits here.</p><p><em>Ace of Spades: Call of the Zombie </em>is available for pre-order on Devir Games' website. It is set to release on May 31, 2026, and will be sold at an MSRP of $9.99.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
