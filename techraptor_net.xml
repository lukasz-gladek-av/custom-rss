            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has revealed the design for Da Red Gobbo 2025 miniature. The tabletop studio continues its tradition of making a Christmas-themed miniature for <em>Warhammer</em>. This year's miniature brings good cheer and a robot suit to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a>.</p><h2>Da Red Gobbo 2025 Miniature Announcement</h2><p>In a recent <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/qskksauw/grotmas-calendar-day-24-da-red-gobbos-big-heist/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop announced Da Red Gobbo 2025 miniature. Much like past Christmas-themed gobbos, this year's miniature is packed with <em>Warhammer's</em> distinct visual excess. In this case, a goblin in a Santa outfit in a freshly stolen experimental suit of armor.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The miniature includes a free battleplan to use in your game. Your army either helps or hinders the jolly goblin from escaping the workshop of Niklozzar of the Ashen Beard. The "nice" player will get a defense boost while protecting Da Red Gobbo. The "naughty" player gets weapon buffs to help them shoot the little guy down.</p><p>As for the gobbo himself, his behavior on the battlefield is random. The reason? He doesn't know how the suit works. This means every turn, he pushes random buttons on the suit, causing different effects. Units might turn invisible. Hit and wound rolls might get re-rolled. Who knows? Certainly not the guy working the suit.</p><p>Da Red Gobbo 2025 is the latest announcement as part of Games Workshop's Grotmas Calendar event. This Advent Calendar-style string of holiday announcements has encompassed all of the studio's popular series, including <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, and the grimdark world of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>.</p><p>The overall quality of these announcements has been mixed at best. They range from short fiction, seasonal painting tutorials, the introductions of the Helsmiths of Hashut faction to <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, new army detachments,, and new missions.</p><p>Nevertheless, Da Red Gobbo 2025 is a great reminder that, for all of the excessive violence, authoritarian nightmares, and existentially terrifying cosmic horrors that live in the <em>Warhammer</em> franchise, Games Workshop knows how to keep things light and fun during the holiday season.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
