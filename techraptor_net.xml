            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As the 2020s have gone on, we’ve seen more and more games make use of the latest and most controversial technology: Generative AI. Whether that’s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/over-500-steam-next-demos-disclosed-generative-ai-usage" title="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/over-500-steam-next-demos-disclosed-generative-ai-usage" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">demos in Steam Next Fest</a> or major games as we’ll see in this article, it has become more widespread by any level of developer.</p><p>While in theory Valve has a policy that Steam games must disclose their usage of Generative AI use, in practice, this is not particularly enforced outside of games that are actively making use of generative AI during gameplay. Titles that have assets, or made use of generative AI during development, often don't disclose their use even if the end product doesn't contain any of those assets.&nbsp;</p><p>When we decided to examine <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025" title="Steam Top New Sellers 2025" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Valve’s list of the top 100 selling new releases</a> in 2025, we found 18 of the top 100 made use of Generative AI, with less than 50% of them disclosing it.</p><p>Below we'll go through the games, broken up by their disclosure, or lack thereof. Additionally, there will be notes on if it finished in the top 12 (Platinum), top 13-24 (Gold), 25-49 (silver), or between 50 and 100 (bronze).&nbsp;</p><h2>Top Sellers That Disclosed Generative AI on Steam</h2><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405690/EA_SPORTS_FC_26/" title="EA Sports FC 26" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>EA Sports FC 26</em></a><em> </em>(Platinum<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/" title="ARC Raiders" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>)</em></a><br><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/" title="ARC Raiders" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>ARC Raiders</em></a> (Platinum)<br><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3948510/ARC_Raiders__Upgrade_to_Deluxe_Edition/" title="ARC Raiders - Upgrade to Deluxe Edition" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>ARC Raiders - Upgrade to Deluxe Edition</em></a> (Bronze)&nbsp;<br><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/" title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> (Gold)<br><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" title="Inzoi " data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Inzoi </em></a>(Gold)&nbsp;<br><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3274580/Anno_117_Pax_Romana/" title="Anno 117: Pax Romana " data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana </em></a>(Gold)&nbsp;</p><p><picture>

There are almost certainly others, as several titles were omitted despite us being fairly sure that they made use of generative AI but we cannot say so definitively. Use of it in areas like coding and ideation is essentially impossible to know about unless a developer reveals it.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
