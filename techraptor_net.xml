            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-75m-best-quarter-ever<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that the PS5 has enjoyed its best quarter yet in terms of sales, bringing total lifetime unit shipments past a major milestone.</p>

<p>In its latest <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q3_supplement.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial report</a> (which covers the fiscal year's third quarter), Sony reveals that it sold 9.5 million PS5 units during the quarter, bringing the console's total lifetime sales over the 75 million mark.</p>

<p>The quarter stands as the PS5's best yet, beating the same period in 2023 by 1.3 million sales despite the fact that the third quarter of 2023 offered up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-pass-548-milion-units-marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies" rel="nofollow">a major hit in the form of&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em></a>.</p>

<p>This means two things. First off, we don't know how well the PS5 Pro has done in isolation; we only know that it's contributed in some way to the 9.5 million number. Second, We don't know what proportion of that 9.5 million consoles represents PS5 Pro sales.</p>

<p>While it's more than likely Sony's hardware business got a boost from the PS5 Pro, the console does boast what is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november" rel="nofollow">arguably a rather prohibitive price point</a> for a general gaming audience, so whether it's sold the kind of numbers that would significantly boost the console's totals is hard to say.</p>

<p>Still, it'll likely provide a confidence boost for Sony, especially after a year that offered up what is probably one of the company's biggest gaming embarrassments in history in the form of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">launch and swift cancellation</a> of hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>.</p>

<p>Sony also reports an increase in PlayStation Plus users, which will likely come as a relief since subscriber numbers remained static throughout the first two quarters of the year.</p>

<p>As for the future, Sony held a State of Play showcase yesterday during which it showed off upcoming PS5 games like&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>,&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Days Gone Remastered</em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-embracer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios' parent company Embracer Group has announced that the developer's medieval RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has "significantly outperformed" its expectations with regards to sales.</p>

<p>In its latest financial report (which covers the period between October and December 2024, but also features a look ahead to the next quarter), Embracer reveals that <i>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</i>is "fast approaching" two million sales.</p>

<p>That means the game has picked up another million sales between now and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">its first day on release</a>, which would explain why Embracer considers the game to have exceeded its sales estimates. Those are impressive numbers, especially for what is arguably a non-triple-A game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-near-2m-fight.jpg?itok=Qa7ojw9I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-near-2m-fight.jpg?itok=Fh-avwum 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has "outperformed" Embracer's expectations for it.</figcaption></figure><p>Embracer says that it has a "strong belief" the medieval RPG will "continue to generate substantial revenues over the coming years", pointing to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">"robust roadmap"</a> Warhorse Studios has in place for the game's next twelve months.</p>

<p>All in all, Embracer says it expects to enjoy a stronger fourth quarter thanks to both&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>and the impending release of&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date" rel="nofollow">set for launch in March</a>.</p>

<p>However, it sounds like Early Access roguelike&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>didn't sell quite as well as Embracer was hoping for, since the company says its Q4 will be "slightly negatively impacted" by the game.</p>

<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>launched into Early Access in January and was quickly met with a negative reception, with players pointing to problems with the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">performance and accessibility features</a>, as well as what some perceive to be odd or poor design decisions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-embracer-group.jpg?itok=xl2m0kkV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-embracer-group.jpg?itok=l-zf5x-y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>doesn't seem to have achieved the sales numbers Embracer would have liked.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to its future, Embracer says that it currently has "10 AAA games under development, of which eight are from internal studios and two from external studios".</p>

<p>The company says this number doesn't include anything being released in the current quarter, so it sounds like games like&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>aren't part of that figure. The games in question are set to release over the next three fiscal years.</p>

<p>Embracer also points to its "exciting mid-sized releases" schedule, which includes games like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window" rel="nofollow">long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em></a>, ARPG&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>, and the console release for&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>.</p>

<p>You can check out Embracer's <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Embracer-Group-publishes-Interim-Report-Q3-October-December-2024-Adjusted-EBIT-amounted-to-SEK-1175-million-8211-above-management-expectations-250213.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full financial report here</a> if you want to read what else is happening across the company and see how its third quarter went.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Next Diablo 4 Expansion Not Due Until 2026, Blizzard Says]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-diablo-4-expansion-2026-blizzard</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-diablo-4-expansion-not-due-until-2026-blizzard-says.1108410/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-diablo-4-expansion-2026-blizzard<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard has revealed that the next&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>expansion won't be arriving until next year, so if you were hoping to play the followup to last year's&nbsp;<em>Vessel of Hatred&nbsp;</em>in 2025, you'll be disappointed, unfortunately.</p>

<p>That's according to&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>general manager Rod Fergusson, who delivered the news during yesterday's DICE summit (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4s-next-expansion-after-vessel-of-hatred-wont-come-until-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>).</p>

<p>According to Fergusson, plans are in place to deliver a&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>roadmap before Season 8, which is expected to land sometime in spring. The game's second expansion won't be on that roadmap, Fergusson says, "because our second expansion is coming in 2026".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-next-expansion-2026-gameplay.jpg?itok=ZvDTTg9w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-next-expansion-2026-gameplay.jpg?itok=bmdcF_0_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Diablo 4</em>'s next expansion won't launch until 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>As IGN points out, Fergusson previously suggested that&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>would be getting an expansion a year, making reference to "annual expansions" and "quarterly seasons" in an <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/diablo/diablo-4-gm-confirms-annual-expansions-for-the-game-2279389/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with Dexerto back in September 2023.</p>

<p>The fact that no&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>expansion will be released in 2026 suggests that there's been a policy shift in that regard at Blizzard, although since Fergusson's reference to the expansion is fairly throwaway, he doesn't provide a concrete reason for the delay.</p>

<p>He did, however, say at the DICE talk that&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-4-expansion-vessel-of-hatred-announced-itll-come-in-late-2024-itll-be-even" rel="nofollow"><em>Vessel of Hatred&nbsp;</em>launched later</a> than Blizzard expected it to, so that could well imply that the company's whole schedule for expansion launches has shifted to accommodate that late launch.</p>

<p>In any case, you're going to be waiting at least another year or so for the next major&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>expansion. The company still appears to be intending to release seasons on a quarterly basis, though, which is encouraging.</p>




<p><em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>is, as you've probably guessed, the fourth major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>series (although it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-immortal-new-class-tempest" rel="nofollow">not the fourth overall</a>). The game returns to the grittier, darker aesthetic of earlier&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>games after&nbsp;<em>Diablo 3</em>'s shift towards a relatively lighter and more stylized aesthetic.</p>

<p>Back in June, it was revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>franchise had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-player-count-gta-5-sales" rel="nofollow">hit 100 million players</a>, although it's worth noting that's not equivalent to sales since it seems to include player counts for the free-to-play&nbsp;<em>Diablo Immortal</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em>, which is available on Game Pass.</p>

<p><em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344520/Diablo_IV/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/diablo-iv/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/store/diablo-iv/9NQRCD3W41L3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>
