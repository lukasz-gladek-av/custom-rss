            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released an Unearthed Arcana update for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. This updated batch of playtest material incorporates player feedback and design revisions to new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Arcane subclasses</a> for the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG.</p>



<p>In a recent post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2061-designer-insights-from-unearthed-arcana-arcane" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, Wizards of the Coast released the new Unearthed Arcana update for the new D&amp;D arcane subclasses. The post was accompanied by design insight from the development team. The team cited player feedback from the initial playtest period when the first batch of Unearthed Arcana released in June.</p>

Some of these changes include streamlining or redesigning certain class features, adding more versatility, or even bringing back features from the previous edition.</p>

<p>A good example is the Arcane Archer Fighter. The Curving Shot feature, which lets the Fighter redirect a ranged attack to another target, now uses the same piece of ammunition but lets the Fighter make a new attack roll. As for versatility, the subclass now has Magical Ammunition, which lets the Fighter cover an area in darkness, thick vines, or tactically unlock and unbar doors and gates with a magical AoE Knock.</p>

<p>The Tattooed Monk essentially got redesigned in the new Unearthed Arcana update. Much like the refined Warrior of the Elements subclass in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Player Handbook</a>, the Tattooed Monk features aren't directly tied to spells. The Beast Tattoo feature provides some cantrip utility, and the Celestial Tattoo feature leans more into exploration bonuses. Finally new Monster Tattoos have been added like the Beholder.</p>

<p>Lastly, the the updated material revises the four new Wizard subclasses. The Conjurer can now grant temporary hit points to things summoned and, at later levels, can summon two creatures with a single cast. The Enchanter gets its Instintive Charm ability back as well as Alter Memories.</p>

<p>Necromancers now have more options on summoning and utilizing undead thralls. You can give them temporary hit points, bonus damage, and at later levels you can have them explode with necrotic energy. Lastly, Transmuter features have been streamlined. The Transmuter's Stone now grants Constitution bonuses in addition to any choices you make, and the Shapechanger feature from 5e returns.</p>

<p>The feedback survey for this new Unearthed Arcana will be going live on September 25.</p>
