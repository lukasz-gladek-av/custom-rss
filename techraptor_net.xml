            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/building-ultimate-captain-america-first-avenger-mtg-deck<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Magic and Marvel are coming together, starting with five secret lairs that are releasing in early November. Five iconic Marvel characters are getting unique <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>cards in their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-magic-gathering-marvel-crossover-details-revealed-including-new-secret-lair-and" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" New Magic: The Gathering Marvel Crossover Details Revealed, Including new Secret Lair and Set">own secret lairs</a>, paired up with reskins or new arts of other cards to complement them.</p>

<p>A Secret Lair gives you some good cards, but we’re going to go through how to build a Marvel MTG deck around the commanders, starting with Captain America, First Avenger</p>

<h3>Examining Captain America, First Avenger</h3>



<p>Our first step is to examine Cap, who is appropriately Red, White, and Blue (in a nice flavor nod, they rearranged the normal order of color display from blue, red, white to fit the traditional America order). He comes with a solid body as a 3 mana 4/4 and has two abilities, in ‘Throw…’ and ‘…Catch’.</p>

<p>Throw… is the more unique ability of the two, letting you unattach an equipment to deal damage equal to the equipment’s mana value divided among up to three targets. Few cards have ever used <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=o%3Aunattach&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="List of cards that have Unattach in their text">unattach in rules text</a>, and none ever in this way. As for …Catch it is a free equip trigger, letting you give Captain America a piece of equipment at the beginning of combat on your turn at no cost.</p>

<p>What this shows us is a commander who is equipment focused, like any number of Boros commanders. Part of what makes Captain America special is that he adds blue to the mix, opening up new cards for this archetype. Combine that with providing a potentially unique take on the archetype, Captain America, the First Avenger provides an interesting tweak on a well known archetype.</p>

<h3>Captain America’s Equipment</h3>



<p>It’s time to suit up Captain America! There are a lot of equipment that can be included but I’m going to focus on a handful that you should look at including in your own Captain America deck.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/72/excalibur-sword-of-eden" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Excalibur, Sword of Eden">Excalibur, Sword of Eden </a>is from the <em>Assassin’s Creed Universes Beyond </em>set, and is the highest mana value equipment in Magic: The Gathering. It also comes down cheaper based on other historic permanents you control (aka legendary cards, saga’s and artifacts). It is perfect for Captain America, First Avenger to throw, but it’s also good for him to wield in combat as it gives the equipped creature +10/+0 and vigilance.</p>

<p>Sword of War and Peace is an automatic inclusion, in its <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/1730/sword-of-war-and-peace" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Shield of War and Peace">Shield of War and Peace</a> styling that comes with the secret lair. You’ll probably want to include at least one other <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=otag%3Asword-of-x-and-y" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Swords of X and Ys">Sword of X and Y</a>, as they are very good. I recommend <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/124/sword-of-feast-and-famine" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sword of Feast and Famine">Sword of Feast and Famine</a> in particular as it untapped lands when you deal damage to an opponent, letting you do some more throwing post-combat or cast more spells, and gives protection from green and black.</p>



<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/rvr/260/illusionists-bracers" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Illusionist's Bracers">Illusionist’s Bracers</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/c21/48/battlemages-bracers" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Battlemage's Bracers">Battlemage’s Bracers</a> are for doubling activating abilities. These are helpful for getting more out of Captain’s Throw… ability, making it far more lethal. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/td2/74/grafted-exoskeleton" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Grafted Exoskeleton">Grafted Exoskeleton </a>is a way to turn those throws into extra lethality by making that damage all poisonous, letting only ten damage wipe out a foe - one Excalibur toss becomes lethal.</p>

<h3>Captain America’s Support</h3>

<p>To get Captain America to battle takes more than just a few weapons however. Luckily, there’s no lack of support that we can supply for him.</p>



<p>With one piece of equipment we really want in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/72/excalibur-sword-of-eden" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Excalibur, Sword of Eden">Excalibur, Sword of Eden</a>, we need quartermaster’s to fetch the goods. That’s why we are looking at tutors like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/31/stoneforge-mystic" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Stoneforge Mystic">Stoneforge Mystic</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/230/kellan-the-fae-blooded-birthright-boon" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Kellan, the Fae Blooded">Kellan, The Fae-Blooded</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/59/steelshapers-gift" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Steelshaper's Gift">Steelshaper’s Gift</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/34/open-the-armory" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Open the Armory">Open the Armory</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mrd/35/fabricate" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fabricate">Fabricate</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/afr/222/fighter-class" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fighter Class">Fighter Class</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmr/6/enlightened-tutor" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Enlightened Tutor">Enlightened Tutor</a>. These all can grab Excalibur, or whichever piece of equipment is most useful at any given moment.</p>

<p>For other equipment support we’re looking to a mix of creatures, and enchantments to get extra value, cheapen the cost and return them. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/17/forge-anew" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Forge Anew">Forge Anew </a>is a staple of equipment decks for good reason, resurrecting one equipment, giving instant-speed equipping, and giving you a free equip each turn. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/698/puresteel-paladin" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Puresteel Paladin">Puresteel Paladin</a> lets us draw cards for playing them (just like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/nec/88/sram-senior-edificer" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sram, Senior Edificer">Sram</a>, who’s also invited to the party), and skip equipment costs as long as we have three or more artifacts.</p>



<p>Reinforcing Captain America, First Avenger we also bring <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mul/65/zirda-the-dawnwaker" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Zirda the Dawnwaker">Zirda, the Dawnwaker </a>to cheapen the cost of his ability, and of all of the equip costs. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otj/203/ertha-jo-frontier-mentor" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Ertha Jo, Frontier mentor">Ertha Jo, Frontier Mentor</a> provides another ability doubler, as well as a pair of bodies to pick up dropped equipment. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/14/codsworth-handy-helper" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Codsworth, Handy Helper">Codsworth, Handy Helper</a> is an under the radar helper as well, as it can freely equip things once a turn, gives Captain America Ward 2, and can tap for two mana to play equipment.</p>

<p>Captain America also needs protection, and for that a mixture of creatures and instants come to mind, in addition to some equipment you can include. In the realm of creature cards, there’s the likes of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/33/skrelv-defector-mite" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Skrelv, Defector Mite">Skrelv, Defector Mite</a> (who I prefer here over <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/clb/702/mother-of-runes" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Mother of Runes">Mother of Runes </a>due to being an artifact, and a legendary creature), and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/669/pippin-guard-of-the-citadel" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Pippin, Guard of the Citadel ">Pippin, Guard of the Citadel</a> who can cheaply stop removal spells. A relatively new option is <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/240/hydroelectric-specimen-hydroelectric-laboratory" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Hydroelectric Specimen">Hydroelectric Specimen </a>which can redirect a single target spell to itself, and as a modal dual-faced card, is optionally playable as a land instead.</p>



<p>Spellwise we have some counterspells and protection spells. The counterspell suite should look at <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/110/arcane-denial" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Arcane Denial">Arcane Denial</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/114/counterspell" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Counterspell">Counterspell</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/94/fierce-guardianship" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fierce Guardianship">Fierce Guardianship</a>, and the modal card <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/241/sink-into-stupor-soporific-springs" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sink into Stupor">Sink into Stupor </a>(another bonus land option), though you can modify this for your preferred counterspells, with the focus being stopping spells that can remove Captain America or key equipment. Protection spells should complement that and include options like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/32/teferis-protection" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Teferi's Protection">Teferi’s Protection</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/1728/flawless-maneuver" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Flawless Maneuver">Flawless Maneuver</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/znr/37/sejiri-shelter-sejiri-glacier" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sejiri Shelter">Sejiri Shelter</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/Deflecting%20Swat" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/214/deflecting-swat">Deflecting Swat</a>.</p>

<p>Using what's above I made an example list, and included a list of later cuts in the maybeboard. Here is <a href="https://archidekt.com/decks/9743049/captain_america" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Captain America Deck">the list </a>for your use to consider ideas for your own list.</p>

<h2>Budget Marvel MTG Options For Captain America, First Avenger</h2>

<p>A lot of the options above aren’t necessarily the cheapest so let’s do a quick budget ($2.00 or less) rundown of cards for some areas.</p>

<p><strong>Support</strong><br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ddu/42/trophy-mage" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Trophy Mage">Trophy Mage</a>: A tutor for expensive artifacts that can also wield the weapons itself.<br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/khm/211/forging-the-tyrite-sword" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Forging The Tyrite Sword">Forging The Tyrite Sword</a>: A slow tutor that also provides a couple mana.<br><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/Bureau%20Headmaster" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Bureau Headmaster">Bureau Headmaster</a>: Cheapen Equipment, and equip costs.<br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/460/brass-squire" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Brass Squire">Brass Squire</a>: Can tap to attach equipment and bypass equip costs.<br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/15/danitha-benalias-hope" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Danitha, Benalia’s Hope">Danitha, Benalia’s Hope</a>: Resurrect or cheat out equipment, and get them attached for free.<br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/335/akiri-fearless-voyager" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Akiri, Fearless Voyager">Akiri, Fearless Voyager</a>: Provides the ability to protect equipped creatures, and draw cards.<br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltc/162/bastion-protector" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Bastion Protector">Bastion Protector</a>: Grows Captain America, and makes him indestructible, even if a 3/3 is a bit vulnerable itself.<br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sta/18/negate" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Negate">Negate</a>: Cheap, solid protection in counterspell form.<br><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ala/173/hindering-light" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Hindering Light">Hindering Light</a>: Counters stuff that targets your stuff.</p>

<p>Hopefully all of this helps you build the best Captain America, First Avenger deck to lead against all the challengers you will face.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/runemasters-review-punishingly-fun<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What is it about sacred temples that make them such juicy targets for roving monsters and villains? That’s a question you… won’t have time to answer in <i>Runemasters</i>, a new <a href="https://funforge.fr/en/products/runemasters">cooperative game by Funforge</a>. I’ve been on a real hot streak reviewing great new board games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/chandigarh-board-game-review-colorful-and-think-y"><i>Chandigarh</i></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/botanicus-review-it-grows-on-you"><i>Botanicus</i></a>, and now the good folks at Flat River Group sent me the slim-but-tricky <i>Runemasters </i>to check out, so follow along for my <i>Runemasters</i> Review!</p>

<h2>What Is <i>Runemasters</i>, And How Do You Play<i>?</i></h2>

<p>Designed by Antoine Prono with illustrations by Paul Mafayon, Théo Guillot, and Adrien Martinez, <i>Runemasters</i> is a cooperative tower defense game for 1 - 4 players, where players take on the role of guardians protecting a temple from hordes of enemies. Each of the four guardians has a different distinct special ability and ultimate power, which you’ll need to use against the incoming threat.</p>

<p>And believe me, that threat will, indeed, be incoming! One of the things I find most interesting about <i>Runemasters </i>is that it is, quite simply put, extremely punishing. I feel like many cooperative games, over the past five years or so, have softened their difficulty levels. This makes sense when so many of them are more narratively driven, inviting users to explore a world and story.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-1.jpeg?itok=CikAl8Pi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-1.jpeg?itok=gRAE-BMw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each hero brings unique skills to the table... will they be enough?</figcaption></figure><p>But sometimes you just want to bash your head against a wall in a coop game that’ll leave your gaming group in shambles, like <i>Pandemic</i> or <i>Spirit Island</i>. <i>Runemasters</i>, I’m happy to report, is a return to that classic form.</p>

<p>In the game, you’ll flip over cards depicting monsters and place them on a colored track that matches their card color. Each turn, they’ll move one space closer to the temple, and automatically deal damage to any hero blocking their path. If no hero’s on the path, they’ll damage the temple. If all your heroes die, or the temple takes too much damage, you lose!</p>

<p>To defeat these monsters, you’ll roll custom six-sided dice. The dice allow you to deal a point of damage to the first enemy in your track if one of their “weak points” matches a symbol you rolled. Or you can use those symbols to power up your ultimate power, perform a special ability, or swap spaces with another guardian.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-dice-rolls.jpeg?itok=ltun32no 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-dice-rolls.jpeg?itok=YO5WLgUv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dice rolled can be used to damage an enemy's weak spots, move, and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Defeat most of the monsters in the stack of monster cards, and you’ll reveal the Dawn card - if you survive with at least one hero still on the board, you win!</p>

<h2>The Pleasure Of Difficulty In <i>Runemasters</i></h2>

<p>Maybe I’m a chronically bad dice roller (FACT), but it was such a challenge to get the right symbols at the right time. There are many clever, interlocking mechanics in this little game that add to your strategic options - you can spend the dice you roll to build a wall, or expend mana points to re-roll dice - but I was still left struggling again and again.</p>

<p>But I want to be clear: <i>this is not a bad thing</i>! Cooperative games in this style have lead to some of the most fun, joyfully anguishing moments in my gaming career, and when we finally did beat the game after multiple tries, we were left feeling utterly triumphant. I really enjoy the way the game doesn’t overload you with options, while still managing to give you a few key tools in your hero’s toolkit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-2.jpeg?itok=bGcYfnQL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-2.jpeg?itok=L3wS_IGj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ismoros's ability to shield heroes from enemies is not to be overlooked.</figcaption></figure><p>The one major downside with <i>Runemasters</i>, however, is also intrinsically tied to the difficulty and design of the game - and that’s player elimination (Boo! Hiss!). In this game, if your hero is killed - that’s it, you’re done! One of the heroes can resurrect other characters twice in the game, but A. that takes a lot of work to build up the magic power to do so and B. if <i>that</i> hero dies, there’s no resurrection happening.</p>

<p>I would like to see a mechanic where you come back after you die, but suffer some sort of penalty. Even if the penalty imposed made the game equally as hard as losing a character, at least that player wouldn’t have to sit around and wait for everyone else to finish the game. In most cooperative games, if your character dies the entire game is a loss (that’s how they do it in the gloriously chunky <i>Cthulhu: Death May Die</i>, which is of course an entirely differently scoped game, but I just played it so it’s fresh in my mind).</p>

<p>The flip side to this, which solves the problem of player death, is that this game can just as easily be played solo mode. You don’t need to make any adjustments, and if one of your characters dies, you’ve still got plenty of game to go!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-enemy-lineup_0.jpeg?itok=anGLWXt5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-enemy-lineup_0.jpeg?itok=igqRqZYZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We're in big trouble here, we've lost a hero (who would be occupying the yellow space) and monsters are backed up on the green path!</figcaption></figure><h2>The Artwork And Components Of <i>Runemasters</i></h2>

<p>The illustrators Paul Mafayon, Théo Guillot, and Adrien Martinez have truly outdone themselves with the quirky, angular designs on all of these cards. The heroes look extremely stylized and have a lot of kinetic movement to them, the monsters are all great renderings of classic dungeon threats, and there’s overall a clean, unfussy look to the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-enemy-cards_0.jpeg?itok=cCsQ79ff 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-enemy-cards_0.jpeg?itok=1xlKmjgp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Enemy cards and event cards show off the distinctive illustrated style of the game.</figcaption></figure><p>The components are sturdy cardboard, with all heroes coming as cardboard standees and all villains represented by cards. This isn’t really a game where you need detailed miniatures, and it keeps the price nice and slim at around $30 at most retailers.</p>

<h2><i>Runemasters </i>Review - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>If you’re looking for a game that’s going to challenge your gaming group, and love a little slash and dash dice-chucking, you won’t find much better out right now than <i>Runemasters</i>. But be warned, player elimination means that you may be sitting by the wayside while your friends are still in the temple trying to defeat a blue dragon! With superior artwork, clean game design, and a high degree of difficulty, <i>Runemasters</i> is a must-try to brave adventurers out there.</p>

Last week we got to sit down with Shire and Alex Uboldi, Game Production Manager at Darrington Press, to talk about the new expansion including the new playable Princesses, how they balanced each character, and whether any more ideas are bouncing around in Shire’s Head.</p>

<p>Before hopping into the interview it’s important to explain that <em>Queen By Midnight</em> is a deckbuilding game where players take on the role of Princesses fighting for a chance to become Queen. Spend Clout to purchase cards from your character deck, or the shared bazaar, to build up your strength and defeat all of the other princesses before the clock strikes midnight.</p>

<h2>The Inception And Collaboration Behind <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em></h2>

<p>To begin our interview Shire introduced himself and the history of development for<em> Queen By Midnight.</em> “The TLDR is wayback in the day I had this weird idea for a card game that I had kicking around for a very long time. I was working full time for a company that rhymes with shmeshminima and didn’t really think anything was going to come from [<em>Queen By Midnight]</em> and when shmeshminima went shmesmwaway I had a bunch of time on my hands and I needed to fill it with something to do. This game became my reason to get out of bed in the morning for the longest time.”</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//y8Vj_uhNKPA"></iframe></p>

<p>After some time, and returning to work, Shire explained that he had continued to work on it behind the scenes until the creation of Darrington Press as the game publishing arm of Critical Role was created. “Darrington Press came along I pitched it to Ivan and thank got someone as talented and wonderful as Alex Uboldi came along and managed to fish all of the good threads out of my tangled mess and managed to make a really great game, and now another one.”</p>

<p>Uboldi hopped in to offer his side of this meeting “When I started at Darrington Press one of the first projects that was handed to me was the original <em>Queen By Midnight</em>. I took it and I played it with a bunch of different groups and every group I played it with loved the game”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Every group I played it with loved the game so I’m like ‘Ok, there’s something special here’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“It was a lot of my job to basically help develop the art, the graphic design, go through all of the cards and make sure there was consistency,” Alex spoke further on his input to the creation of the finished product that we know today. “Basically it was bringing Kyle’s vision to life in the most beautiful way possible.”</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-preview-image.jpg?itok=ouBHUQCt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-preview-image.jpg?itok=sIy4lBGN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Quarter Past</em> sitting next to the base game of <em>Queen By Midnight</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Reception Worthy Of A Queen</h2>

<p>I asked Shire what it was like having that game, that he was working on in the backburner become such a success, he said “It’s been a dream come true. Any single time I am able to go into a game store and see my game, and talk to game store owners and people playing it, and get their feedback there’s no greater feeling.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I love hearing all the stories of people saying ‘I won with this character, and I really want to try these other characters’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shire and Uboldi shared a common appreciation of hearing peoples stories of winning the game. Whether it be a slow burn through the game, taking out specific Princesses immediately, or using an ability to steal everyone’s Clout etc.</p>

<p>Uboldi admitted “Those stories of people playing the game, that’s why I really do this.”</p>

<h2>How To Build A Princess</h2>

<p>When Shire brought the game to Uboldi and the Darrington Press team he already had a lot of ideas for the Princesses, how they would perform uniquely, and what kind of personality they would have.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board_0.jpg?itok=M0jQriZg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board_0.jpg?itok=VjnhS9aK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Azil With A Z is a new Princess for <em>Quarter Past</em></figcaption></figure><p>“We did a lot of working together to make sure the Princesses felt like they were their identities, they developed in cool and interesting ways. Neither of us expected as we were bouncing ideas off each other that these Princesses would develop into fully fledged characters that both of us are happy with.”</p>

<p>Speaking to the expansion Uboldi explained that the process was very similar “We wanted to make the expansion for this game because we love this world and we want to see more from it. Kyle laid out all of the design for the four new pricesses.” At that time Shire already had ideas for the vibes of each of these new Princesses as well as their mechanics to make them a unique play experience at the table.</p>



<p>Four new Princesses have been added as part of <em>Quarter Past</em>; Elise LeKraken, Azil With A Z, Kahurere Skyfisher, and Qasima Al-Basar.</p>

<p>Talking on the inspirations for these characters Shire explained that "if Ursula is to Devine, then you will have Elise LeKraken to Monet X Change. Dialing back to the original conceit behind Ursula and making that the focal point for our mermaid princess is just absolutely inspired."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For more on the mechanics and gameplay style for each of these new Princesses you can check out our full review of <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Azil With A Z is our wonderful nod to Alice in Wonderland. Our absurdist and surreal princess. Her whole vibe is that she's the only princess who has access to all three classes. I always tell people that she's the chaos character, if you're not interested in winning but want to cause a bunch of chaos you've got to play Azil."</p>

<p>Uboldi continued describing the characters talking about Qasima Al-Basar "who is our Princess Jasmine meeds Aladdin analog. By day she's a princess and by night she's a vigilante who protects her kingdom personally. We wanted to create a character who felt like she hed a lot of tools for espionage, but if she needs to she doles out great damage."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-character-decks_0.jpg?itok=4FAHv1II 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-character-decks_0.jpg?itok=tEXcy-me 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each Princess has their own unique deck and playstyle</figcaption></figure><p>The last of the new characters is Kahurere Skyfisher who doesn't want to be Queen, but she wants to bring the whole system down. "She is Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia meets Moana. Because she doesn't have this grand kingdom she has to use more covert means. Her mechanic is laying traps for all the other Princesses. They can either keep the traps in their hand to be a dead card or play the trap to draw another card, but the trap will do something to help Skyfisher"</p>

<p>This deck is all about the other players making choices to have benefits together, or working against one another. Uboldi explained that what drew him to liking this character was that it's very "Interactive. It lets you talk to the whole table and it involves everyone and that's where the game is it's most fun"</p>

<p>While all four of these characters have their own unique mechanics Shire did explain that they designed each to be a far more aggressive character, making big moves quickly.</p>

<h2>There Might Be Two Lost Princesses?</h2>

<p>Interestingly when talking about how he came up with the original concepts for the Princesses that the first game would have twelve Princesses. "So I had cooked up rough ideas for 12 princesses, eventually I thought it was madness and cut it down to six that I felt like were the six most well baked out of them."</p>

<p>From the other six they were included in Shire's original draft of the first game for potential expansions and four of those are what we can now play. When asked if we would see these two final Princesses Shire said "I don't know, we'll have to figure that out, I have an idea but we'll see…" as Uboldi shrugged.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-clock_0.jpg?itok=h3MVrdxX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-clock_0.jpg?itok=yACaCTQb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Instead of the full clocktower <em>Quarter Past</em> tracks the game with this more portable alternative</figcaption></figure><h2>Creating Balance Across The Lands</h2>

<p>As each Princess has their own unique deck and you can now play with up to ten Princesses I was curious to understand how they approached balancing so many characters. Having already created the prior six helped them have a good baseline. Uboldi explained that "We looked at the original princesses and the baseline power level. We scaled everything to match that power level, but because we were making these changes to the core deck it changes the dynamic of these princesses to be much more aggressive."</p>

<p>By not having the ability to block an attack, it allowed them to design the pricesses to be more aggressive knowing that they're also more vulnerable to attacks.</p>

<p>"Against each other they felt very balanced, but against the Core Set Princesses there was interesting gameplay for the Princesses who are holding off an assault and trying to go over the top or Princesses who are trying to race down their opponents."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-errata-cards_0.jpg?itok=vni-9QJo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-errata-cards_0.jpg?itok=6ECpO2BL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This expansion also contains errata cards for the base version so you can play it in it's 'best' form</figcaption></figure><h2>Expansion As Well As Standalone</h2>

<p>Many board games when expanding a roster of playable characters would simply release a character expansion and move on. For <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em> I was impressed that not only was this four new playable characters that interact with one another but that it came with all that that you need to play it on it's own.</p>

<p>Uboldi explained that for Darrington Press they understood that the base game retailing at $70 that was a high price point for something you might not like. "We designed <em>Quarter Past</em> as a great entry place for newer players"</p>

<p>"We really wanted it to work well on it's own, we even designed the Princesses and Bazaar cards to be simpler but mechanically deep to make this as approachable for a new entry player as possible."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-review-more-princesses-more-problems<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's now been a little over a year since I played <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="449834bb-ce3a-4a84-8de1-5fb9557c6eb0" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-review-im-prettiest-princess">Darrington Press' <em>Queen By Midnight</em></a>. Taking part in a deckbuilding battle royale where the victor walks away the titular Queen By Midnight this game showed off unique mechanics and a gorgeous cardboard craft clock that serves not only as an impressive setpiece but manages core game mechanics. Now with the standalone expansion, Queen By Midnight Quarter Past, four new Princesses join the fray.</p>



<p>Contained within the box of <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em> you'll find complete instructions for how to play the game (including boxes that specify what's new in this edition), a flat clock for turn tracking, boards and tokens for each of the four Princesses, specific decks for each Princess, and a deck of Bazaar cards broken up into three time segments.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-box-components.jpg?itok=Zq-p2lpO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-box-components.jpg?itok=oPzJKEbK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If you have played <em>Queen By Midnight</em>, then setting up and playing the game will come as no surprise. Players each pick which of the Princesses they wish to play as, gathering up the relevant character board and deck. Then, the clock is laid out and set up with Bazaar cards. Once everyone is ready you roll the dice to see who goes first and begin playing your cards.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While in the original game the clock was a massive structure that doubled as a dice tower that you would build and place on a spinning platform the clock included in Quarter Past is a flat clock. While less intricate it does promote the idea of Quarter Past functioning as a 'travel' version of the game, while the larger box can stay at home.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>A quick gameplay overview</h2>

<p>Working to develop their decks players will use cards to increase their Clout, the primary currency in the game, and purchase new cards. Cards can be purchased from a Princesses specific Vault, which will contain abilities unique to the Princess, or they can be purchased from the Bazaar which offers a more generic, but useful nonetheless, variety of abilities.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Each newly purchased card is sent to the Archive, this game's equivalent of a graveyard, when it will be shuffled back into their deck to then be used against other Princesses.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board.jpg?itok=64-l8yI3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board.jpg?itok=kMf9E-a6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is a constant balance of spending and regaining Clout, as your deck grows in size you'll quickly learn you can't just be spending Clout freely as your ability to regain it will return less and less frequently. Alternatively, leaving too much Clout on your board does leave it in a place where it can get stolen by another's card effects.</p>

<p>The deckbuilding alone is a lot of fun but after each player has completed a turn the clock will increment by one. At certain key times, like 5 o'clock or 8 O'Clock important events can happen such as the Bazaar cards being swapped out for a deck filled with more powerful abilities, or the hand size limit is increased.</p>

<p>The game ultimately ends after the clock reaches 12, or if only one competing Princess remains. This does a good job to keep a cap on the events of the game and to limit just how much power creep can occur.</p>

<h2>Drawing At The Start Slows The Game Down</h2>

<p>One of the largest issues that I've found with <em>Queen By Midnight</em> is that as long as you have clout you can be activating cards, in most scenarios, especially in the early game you'll be spending down your entire hand before the end of your turn.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-vault.jpg?itok=QXDKF-Bm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-vault.jpg?itok=KrnB9LHl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Sitting at the table with nothing in your hand isn't anything I have an issue with, but not knowing what I'm going to draw next will mean I have no clue what any of my options are for next turn.</p>

<p>At the start of each player's turn momentum always slows. A fresh hand of cards are drawn, effects are read, Clout is increased, and the six purchasable cards may be reviewed.</p>

<p>This will mean that unless you're playing with a group that knows their Princesses' abilities inside and out that you are limited in how much time you can be strategizing, or you leave the table waiting on you for your move (while they too have no clue what they're going to do next).</p>

<h2>The new Princesses and their abilities</h2>

<p>As the name implies <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em> sees four new Princesses joining. This expansion includes Azil With-A-Z, Elise LaKraken, Kahurere Skyfisher, and Qasima Al-Basar. Each comes with their own unique mechanics and playstyle that let you mix and match against other players for strange situations.</p>

<p>Azil With-A-Z is a reference to Alice in Wonderland, with the ability to Shrink and Grow. By changing her size she also alters one of her Classes between Brawler and Schemer. Her abilities are incredibly strong, but as you can only perform certain abilities when a certain class you can also end up being stuck unable to deal damage.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun playing with Azil, there's an important aspect of needing to plan your moves as far out as you can. If an ability would deal damage, but then cause you to shrink, what can you then do in that state? Do you have a way to grow again? It was very satisfying when everything fell into place.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-mechanic.jpg?itok=RsOFrZ3q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-mechanic.jpg?itok=kEjbZ7hI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Elise LeKraken is a Schemer/Caster character whose core mechanic is to banish her own cards. This would all be a power play to then unleash ultimate abilities near the end of the game to flip the game in her favour.</p>

<p>It was interesting that LeKraken worked almost as a sleeper character, but knowing her mechanics and targeting her early could also be an easy downfall depending on the number of players and how dedicated they were to knocking competition out of the game.</p>

<p>Kahurere Skyfisher is a Brawler/Schemer whose mechanic is in traps. She has a variety of cards that can be placed in other players Archives. When activated those cards might gain a benefit to the Princess, such as getting to draw a card, but it will also provide a boon to Skyfisher.</p>

<p>Whether it be ways to steal Clout or also be able to draw a card there's a lot of good that can be done for Skyfisher on another player's turn, not to mention the inclusion of a card like this is their deck might mean it takes them longer to draw a card they're actually interested in getting.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-character-decks.jpg?itok=LXzowDwL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-character-decks.jpg?itok=hy1Clj8u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Strangely the card we saw the most from the Skyfisher was to be able to steal 4 Clout. This is a large amount of Clout to be able to freely obtain, but when early turns comprise of gaining a lot of Clout and then spending it down to zero we most often ended up in situations where there wasn't any Clout to steal effectively rendering that card useless.</p>

<p>If Elise LeKraken is a sleeper the opposite of that is Qasima Al-Basar, the Brawler/Caster. This character doesn't start extremely strong but with some smart purchases will not only be dealing consistent damage, but will also grant themselves permanent damage boosts. A hit of three or four damage might not be much early on, but when the pace doesn't even stop but she's now hitting with eight damage you're going to be in trouble very quickly.</p>

<p>While Skyfisher seemed to have a narrower range of effectiveness the engine that is driving each of these decks is wildly different and a lot of fun. Further fleshing out the availability from the previously released Princesses the idea of "there's a playstyle for any kind of deckbuilding player" is even more true than before.</p>

<p>I think one of the best compliments I can give for the game is that it feels like getting to play Magic The Gathering, without the need to build a deck and strategy from the ground up. That being said there's still a lot of building as you weigh up purchasing cards from the Vault and Bazaar.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Everything included in the box allows you to play <em>Queen By Midnight</em> from start to finish with four players. As an expansion though all of the Princesses available in this box can be played with any of the six previously available Princesses.</p>

<p>While Skyfisher seemed to have issues when facing off against Azil, it might be that there's another Princess that she has a definite advantage against.</p>

<p>To add further to this being an expansion Errata Cards for the base game have also been included in this update. These cards should be swapped out with cards that appear in the base game to better balance the experience.</p>

<p>I genuinely enjoyed the original game when I played it so I was excited to hear that there would be an expansion. The triple versatility allowing it to add more characters for fans of the base game, be a smaller entry point for new players, and even serve as a way to send updated cards allows it to achieve it's goal perfectly.</p>

<p>Of the four new Princesses I'm a little iffy on Skyfisher, but had a blast seeing what the other three were able to accomplish.</p>

<p>If you were a fan of the original game then this expansion is a no brainer, and if you don't know the original but are looking for a fun and deep deckbuilder where the game naturally scales as time goes on then I'd highly recommend checking this out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-photo-puzzle-solved<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An enterprising&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>player has solved a rather involved puzzle involving examining in-game photos, earning himself some praise from the game's director into the bargain.</p>

<p>Redditor Dale Robinson <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1gine5k/i_solved_the_sh2_remake_photos_secret/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">created a lengthy post yesterday</a> detailing all the steps he took to solve the puzzle. I don't wish to spoil the steps just in case you want to discover it for yourself, but suffice it to say that you'll need a healthy dose of lateral thinking if you do.</p>

<p>Robinson's efforts were <a href="https://x.com/Mateusz_Lenart_/status/1853189523745730675" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lauded on X (formerly Twitter)</a> by&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>director Mateusz Lenart, who said he "knew it wouldn't stay hidden for long" and congratulated Robinson for solving the brain-teaser, suggesting that the "timing couldn't be better". Again, that post contains puzzle spoilers, so click at your peril.</p>

<p>Just in case you're unaware, the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake is, believe it or not, a reimagined version of the original 2002 survival horror classic. While the original game was created by Konami, this one's been developed by&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/medium">The Medium</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Layers of Fear&nbsp;</em>studio Bloober Team, with Konami serving as publisher.</p>

<p>The game hews fairly closely to the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>'s story, but it features a new over-the-shoulder camera perspective, as well as extra story elements and quality-of-life gameplay tweaks.</p>




<p>The game proved popular with both critics and fans, selling <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-1m">a million copies within its first three days</a> on sale, although that didn't stop <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-wikipedia-page-locked">Wikipedia trolls from trying to edit the game's page</a> to suggest it had received much lower scores than it actually did.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix-goes-all-in-on-generative-ai-for-gaming-appoints-dedicated-vp.1026825/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has appointed a VP (vice president) of generative AI within its gaming division, indicating that the tech giant is serious about the controversial technology when it comes to video games.</p>

<p>The VP in question is none other than Mike Verdu, who confirmed the news <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mike-verdu-2a6113_new-role-at-netflix-vp-genai-for-games-activity-7259029850827423744-YMg4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via his LinkedIn page</a>. Verdu says his new role at Netflix is to drive "a 'once in a generation' inflection point for game development and player experiences using generative AI".</p>

<p>Previously, Verdu worked as Netflix's overall games VP, but that role will now be filled by Alain Tascan, who Verdu says is "already in the process of taking Netflix Games in exciting new directions".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/netflix-games-generative-ai-vp-tiles.jpg?itok=pPu8zuXh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/netflix-games-generative-ai-vp-tiles.jpg?itok=cjQSaYPt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Netflix has appointed a VP to handle generative AI for its gaming division.</figcaption></figure><p>Verdu says that generative AI represents a return to "seemingly unlimited potential and the rapid pace of innvoation" in gaming, expressing excitement he says he hasn't felt "since the 90s".</p>

<p>He also exhorts readers to "pay no mind to the uninformed speculation in the media" about recent changes to Netflix Games, presumably referring to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report">reported closure</a> of Netflix's in-house AAA development studio, codenamed Team Blue.</p>

<p>According to Verdu, everything that's happened within Netflix Games in the last several months "was actually a planned transition", suggesting that the closure of Team Blue wasn't a kneejerk response but a carefully-considered decision.</p>

<p>The vision for generative AI at Netflix, according to Verdu, is one that "puts creative talent at the center", uses AI as "a catalyst and an accelerant", and enables big development teams to "move much faster".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-generative-ai.jpg?itok=hcGzR3dw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-generative-ai.jpg?itok=IiC-FpfN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Other studios, like Ubisoft, are also leaning into generative AI.</figcaption></figure><p>The topic of generative AI is a controversial one in the gaming world (and, indeed, the rest of the world) right now.</p>

<p>Proponents like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-expresses-support-of-ai-in-dungeons-dragons">Hasbro</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nihon-falcom-considering-ai-translation">Nihon Falcom</a>, and <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5qXdxhshJBXoanFZApdG3L/how-ubisofts-new-generative-ai-prototype-changes-the-narrative-for-npcs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ubisoft</a>&nbsp;tout the potential benefits of the technology and seem enthusiastic about the ways in which they believe it could change the gaming landscape, but there are certainly no shortage of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans">ambivalent</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kobold-press-ceo-says-no-to-generative-ai">skeptical voices</a> in the industry on this front.</p>

<p>In any case, we don't know exactly how Verdu and Netflix intend to use generative AI, so we'll likely have to wait until a major project from the company is announced in order to learn more. Stay tuned!</p>
