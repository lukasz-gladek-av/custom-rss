            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Solo game dev Cara Cadaver has revealed that her indie horror game&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>has been banned from Steam, and having played the game myself, I can tell you the reason is...a little strange.</p>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/dirtlord77/status/1949867514797707531" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media</a>, Cadaver says that <i>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</i>was banned from Steam for "sexual content with depictions of real people". As she points out, the game wasn't banned for "its use of gore in storytelling, or the violent themes".</p>

<p>The twist? As Cadaver says in her post, the sexual content for which the game was taken off Steam is "all implied". There's no explicit depiction of any kind of sexual act within the game; there are plenty of shocking and disturbing images, and the narrative is pretty unsettling, but that's about it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-steam-banned-emails.jpg?itok=uotDK6lT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-steam-banned-emails.jpg?itok=5CF3h4y2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>isn't coming to Steam anytime soon, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>Cadaver says she doesn't want to censor&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>or make changes to it; she says she "will not retell a story about these topics in a way to make people who don't understand it more comfortable".</p>

<p>Together with publisher DreadXP, Cadaver says she's currently looking into alternate ways to release&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>, and you can expect to hear "specific details" next week. Make sure to check out Cadaver's X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/dirtlord77" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">account</a> or <a href="https://x.com/dreadxpgames" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">that of DreadXP</a> for further info.</p>

<p>For context, Steam delisted a bunch of adult games from its platform earlier this month, citing concern from payment processors regarding the explicit content present in those games. Indie platform Itch.io <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itch-io-deindexes-adult-pages" rel="nofollow">quickly followed suit</a>&nbsp;(although the original version of&nbsp;<em>Vile&nbsp;</em><a href="https://final-girl-games.itch.io/vile" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">remains intact</a> on that site, ironically).</p>

<p>It all stems from a <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">campaign</a> started by activist group Collective Shout regarding a game by the name of&nbsp;<em>No Mercy</em>, an explicit title the group says "fl[ies] in the face of efforts to address violence against women".</p>




<p>The decision to remove Cadaver's game from Steam is, frankly, bizarre. If the point, as Collective Shout sees it, is to "address violence against women", then removing a game that directly tackles this theme in a frank and open way seems like a big mistake to me.</p>

<p>Of course, it's entirely likely that Steam simply panicked and pulled the plug on any game that might stand even the slightest chance of upsetting its payment processors, even if that game is about as far from "fl[ying] in the face of efforts to address violence against women" as it's possible to be.</p>

<p>Hopefully, Cadaver and DreadXP can find a way to release&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>somewhere else. In the meantime, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer" rel="nofollow">read my review</a> to find out why it's not only an important game from a message standpoint, but also a great experience in its own right.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> Secret Lair Chaos Vault drops. This otherwise random subset of Secret Lair drops all appear to be sci-fi themed, thematically connecting them to the newest set, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-new-commanders-in-mtg-edge-of-eternities" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Edge of Eternities</em></a>.</p>



<p>On the official <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/en/chaosvault#filter-product-1246458|sort-availability_wotc,featured" rel="nofollow">Secret Lair website</a>, there are eight new Chaos Vault drops. Four of those drops contain five cards taken from the <em>Edge of Eternities</em> set. The other four, called Commander Reinforcements, include an <em>Edge of Eternities</em> Commander deck.</p>

This drop features, in both foil and non-foil, five cards with evocative artwork by Ian Permana. The drop contains the following cards:</p>

<ul><li><em>Reprocess</em></li>
	<li><em>Aggressive Mining</em></li>
	<li><em>Sylvan Safekeeper</em></li>
	<li><em>Crucible of Worlds</em></li>
	<li><em>Zuran Orb</em></li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-chaos-vault-featuring-deathburger-promo-art.jpg?itok=iin6Yq-W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-chaos-vault-featuring-deathburger-promo-art.jpg?itok=lBiLxBb4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those who appreciate the elegance of machinery over flesh, the second drop, <em>Featuring: Deathburger</em> may be for you. As the name implies, this foil and non-foil drop features Josan Gonzales aka Deathburger's, provocative cyberpunk artwork. The cards he has reinterpreted are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Ethersworn Canonist</em></li>
	<li><em>Goblin Engineer</em></li>
	<li><em>Dance of the Manse&nbsp;</em></li>
	<li><em>Arcbound Ravager</em></li>
	<li><em>Foundry Inspector</em></li>
</ul><p>The second half of the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Secret Lair Chaos Vault drops are mostly for those with deep pockets and a love for Commander. The <em>Commander Reinforcements: World Shaper</em> drop contains everything from the Alien Auroras drop as well as the World Shaper Commander Deck.</p>

<p>Similarly, <em>Commander Reinforcements: Counter Intelligence</em> includes everything from the <em>Featuring: Deathbringer&nbsp;</em>drop and the Counter Intelligence Commander deck.</p>

<p>The <em>Alien Auroras</em> and <em>Featuring: Deathburger</em> drops are being sold at MSRPs of $29.99 (non-foil) and $59.99 (foil), respectively. The <em>Commander Reinforcements</em> drops are being sold at MSRPs of $74.98 (non-foil) and $104.98 (foil). These drops will only be available while supplies last. If you are interested in any of these drops, and have the cash to spare, it is better to secure yours now.</p>
