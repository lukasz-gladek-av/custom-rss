They allow for longtime fans to re-engage with a piece of media they love. Remasters also open the door for a whole new crowd to experience something for the first time. I'm in the latter with the remaster of <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny</em>, and I'm very glad to have the chance to play this beloved series.</p>

<p>Beloved, indeed. The <em>Onimusha</em> series may not be as popular as <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/capcom" rel="nofollow">Capcom's</a> larger franchises, but it's still revered by fans across the globe.&nbsp;This action-oriented series takes elements from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/resident-evil" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil</em></a> franchise and makes it a faster-paced, Sengoku-era adventure as we step into the role of Jubei, a samurai hell-bent on revenge against a demonic Oda Nobunaga.</p>

Not anymore.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny </em>Gets the Remaster Treatment</h2>

<p>I enjoyed <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai</em>'s <em>Destiny </em>so much that I went back and played the original almost immediately after. Admittedly, I should have played the first game in the series, well, <em>first</em>, but the upcoming <em>Onimusha</em> inspired me to jump into the series in whatever way I could.</p>

<p><em>Onimusha 2</em> is a delightful remaster that contains almost everything you'd want to see: Enhanced visuals, support for modern platforms, and quality-of-life updates. In terms of visual fidelity, <em>Onimusha 2</em> does a lot to remaster the graphics of this nearly 25-year-old PS2 game.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/761600/Onimusha_Warlords/" rel="nofollow"><em>Onimusha: Warlords</em></a>, the original game in the series from 2001, received a remaster in 2019. It's more or less the same age as its sequel, yet the remastered visuals in the original aren't quite up to snuff when you compare the two.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/onimusha-2-visuals-1.jpg?itok=WdOebxNl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/onimusha-2-visuals-1.jpg?itok=HQca-n1h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This game oozes with style.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Onimusha 2</em>'s<em> </em>enhanced visuals are crystal clear. The backgrounds are exceptionally well done, breathing new life into an aging title. Textures look wonderful on higher resolutions. The various Japanese castles, dense forests, and supernatural, demonic environments are very well done here. Having a fixed camera assures that every angle looks quite spectacular.</p>

<p>The only thing it's missing is support for higher frame rates, but like its predecessor, it's locked to 60 FPS. It's not the end of the world, but it would have been nice to see. Other than that, the remaster ran flawlessly on PC.</p>

<p>In terms of controls, <em>Onimusha 2</em> translates well over to modern controllers. I like the option of using the d-pad for tank controls (as it was in the base version), but using a joystick is a much-needed and welcome quality-of-life improvement.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/story-paths-onimusha-2.jpg?itok=kJGpfbL6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/story-paths-onimusha-2.jpg?itok=Ffo22YUE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Upon beating the game, you can see where your relationship with certain characters impacted the flow of the story.</figcaption></figure><p>One additional quality-of-life feature, which wasn't in the remaster of the first game nor in the original version of this title, is auto-save. There are fixed save points, like <em>Resident Evil</em>'s typewriters, so with the new auto-save, if you have a power outage or just have to go at any given moment, you won't lose as much progress.</p>

<p>What <em>isn't</em> included that I would have enjoyed, other than support for higher frame rates, is New Game +. The story is structured in such a way that you have branching paths. Going back and filling in the blanks in order to see the whole story this game has to offer, well, you'll just have to start from square one. That means all your upgrades are for naught if you start a new game.</p>

<p>The intended course of action after beating the campaign is to up the difficulty -- and there is a new, brutal difficulty called Hell Mode, here -- but I'd much rather have an easier way of seeing all the story while retaining my health, magic, armor, and weapon upgrades from previous runs.</p>

<p>Since we're on the topic of story, let's talk about <em>just </em>how insane this game is. If you thought <em>Resident Evil</em> was campy, you ain't seen nothin' yet. <em>Onimusha 2</em> is so unabashedly goofy that it makes Chris Redfield punching a boulder look serious.</p>

<p>It's the translation and dub that make it what it is. It's not a quality translation, from what I've heard, and the voice acting is so bad that it becomes good. Jubei's dude-bro voice and just how nonchalant he is, despite going through literal hell to get his revenge, is endearing.</p>

<p>The downside to all of this is, if you're looking for a serious, Sengoku-era action flick, this isn't it. It's weird, it's zany, and the story is practically non-existent. The best way to enjoy it is by relishing in the weirdness and appreciating it for what it is, rather than what it isn't. I'll leave it at that. Go in blind, and you'll have a blast.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/onimusha-2-gameplay-3.jpg?itok=5jK9A7h1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/onimusha-2-gameplay-3.jpg?itok=d4PYz8pr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't mess with Jubei!</figcaption></figure><h2>Sengoku Swordplay, with Magic!</h2>

<p>For whatever reason, I was operating under the assumption that <em>Onimusha 2</em> played more like a <em>Devil May Cry</em> or <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> game. I was pleased to find it's more akin to <em>Resident Evil</em> than anything else, and that <em>Onimusha </em>deliberately borrowed many elements from it.</p>

<p>Fixed camera angles, limited resources, light puzzle solving, and more. If you like the older <em>Resident Evil</em> games, you'll definitely enjoy this. <em>Onimusha 2</em> is, however, more fast-paced with hack-and-slash combat, meaning you <em>don't</em> have to figure out whether you should conserve bullets or not; well, for the most part.</p>

<p>There are four separate weapons in this game, each behaving differently from one another. There's a sword, spear, double-blade, and a giant hammer. They have an element attached to them and have separate magic attacks. Being able to switch these on the fly makes combat smooth, and magic packs a much-needed punch on stronger enemies and bosses.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/onimusha-2-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=SGiB4tTo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/onimusha-2-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=vdhOHv05 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes, the story puts you in control of other characters from the story, like Oyu. They have their own set of moves.</figcaption></figure><p>You also have a bow and rifle, which won't be used as much since they have limited ammo. The main source of damage is through your melee weapons,&nbsp;though, and don't you forget it: This isn't <em>Resident Evil!</em></p>

<p>Enemy corpses drop souls, which you can absorb through your hand. These orbs are used to upgrade weapons and armor to become stronger, so there's a decent amount of progression available throughout the story. Some orbs also heal or regain your mana, so using this in the middle of combat when a bunch of foes surround you can be a bit tense.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/onimusha-2-gameplay-1.jpg?itok=e6Let6qN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/onimusha-2-gameplay-1.jpg?itok=dH3ALGzF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Move, big boy!</figcaption></figure><p>While weapon movesets are pretty standard, mostly utilizing just the joystick and one attack button, ass well as a charge attack, you have some nuance to the gameplay with the Issen system. The Issen is a counter to enemy attacks. Right before they hit, Jubei can counter by doing a critical strike.</p>

<p>For many enemies, the Issen kills them in one hit or, at the very least, depletes their health by a <em>lot</em>. Getting the timing of this system down is very tricky and takes practice, as each enemy attack has different timings. Deliberately waiting for an enemy to strike, then countering with one powerful hit, is immensely satisfying.</p>

<p>Overall, combat is fun, but it's also a product of its time. The enemy variety isn't too impressive, and they also spawn to an absurd degree. Like a hydra head, cut one down, and two more will pop up.&nbsp;The original <em>Onimusha </em>got it down with enemy variety, as it wasn't overwhelming but still enough to be a challenge. <em>Ominusha 2</em> is relentless. Chill out, Nobunaga.</p>

<p>Well, Capcom, you can count me in as an <em>Onimusha </em>fan. With the next entry in the series dropping in, hopefully, 2026, I'll be very interested to see how Capcom modernizes the series' formula. And hey, it wouldn't hurt to have the third or fourth game remastered, too. Just sayin'!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/skyfall-rpg-comes-to-us-via-kickstarter-campaign<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <em>Skyfall RPG</em> setting is coming to <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> 2024</em>. The beloved setting, originally only available in Portuguese, will be coming to an international audience courtesy of a Kickstarter campaign. The setting will include brand-new magitech-based player options.</p>

<h2>The <em>Skyfall RPG</em> Setting Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to its official Kickstarter page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/skyfallrpg/skyfall-5e-a-world-destined-to-end" rel="nofollow"><em>Skyfall RPG</em></a> was created by Capycat Games' CEO Silvia Sala. It has an established community of passionate fans in Brazil. Now, thanks to a partnership with Knight Moves Cafe, this Kickstarter is localizing Skyfall to an international English-speaking audience. This includes physical and digital books alongside official VTT support via Roll20 and Foundry.</p>

It is a land haunted by titular skyfalls: gigantic islands plummeting from the sky as if thrown by vengeful gods. The devastation caused by these skyfalls has led to a fractured world — a world whose people whisper of a prophesied cataclysm that will end all life as they know it.</p>

<p>But hope still thrives in Opath thanks to the discovery of a rare and volatile mineral called Aetherium. This mineral pulses with arcane power, giving rise to Aetherpunk: a blend of sorcery and invention. For those brave or desperate enough to utilize Aetherpunk gadgets, impossible machines can be made to reshape the world.</p>

<p>Between the fear of annihilation and the hope of Aether, the world of <em>Skyfall RPG</em> contains so much more. Alliances forged and broken in pursuit of power. Goddesses and Titans walking among mortals. An entity known as The Shade tempts people into deals for their mortal souls. The world is on the brink, and the question still lies: will you rise or be forgotten?</p>

The setting is (thanks to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-releasing-updated-dungeons-dragons-2024-srd-at-end-of-month" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new SRD</a>) based on the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 ruleset and contains new Aetherpunk-based subclasses, four new playable species, new magitech equipment, including Bluster firearms, and over 40 unique monster statblocks.</p>

<p>The subclasses found in the book help bring a magitech twist to certain <em>D&amp;D</em> classes. For example, the Path of Augmentation Barbarians enhance their bodies with Aetherpunk enhancements, turning them into juggernauts. In addition, there is the Blustermage Wizard, a master of the arcane arts who also went to the magical gun firing range.</p>

<p>The four playable species also have their novelty. The Anuri are frogfolk descended from the royal swamp dynasties of Blurgh'ta. Drakelings are small metallic dragonkin dedicated to protecting the land. Sanguir are cursed nobles with vampiric heritages. Lastly, there are the Urodel, small lizard creatures tied to the changing of the seasons.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for <em>Skyfall RPG</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Digital Doomsayer for $25:</strong> A PDF of the campaign setting book, a Kickstarter exclusive prewritten adventure, access to playtests and weekly adventures, and your name in a Special Thanks in the books' credits.</li>
	<li><strong>Magitech Hero for $50:</strong> Everything in the <em>Digital Doomsayer</em> pledge, a physical copy of the book, and digital maps for a hexcrawl adventure.</li>
	<li><strong>Opath Techblade for $210:</strong> Everything in the <em>Magitech Hero</em> tier, physical and digital hexcrawl adventure maps, a DM screen, a hardslip case, physical campaign maps, character sheets, stickers, an exclusive soundtrack, and VTT access on Roll20 and Foundry.</li>
</ul><p>Lastly, the Kickstarter campaign addresses the overhanging issues of the imposed US trade tariffs. It states that, since the campaign doesn't include miniatures or dice, the products produced will be "paper only," <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ttrpg-books-might-be-exempt-from-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dodging increased import</a> costs.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the <em>Skyfall RPG</em> Kickstarter campaign has only made small steps, raising $320 of its $20,000 initial goal. The campaign concludes June 19.</p>
