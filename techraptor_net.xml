            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paizo is changing the way they're publishing <em>Pathfinder</em> Adventure Paths. The publisher behind the beloved fantasy TTRPG has been releasing prewritten adventures the same way since 2007, but will change in response to a different tabletop gaming landscape.</p>

<h2>The New Pathfinder Adventure Paths Changes</h2>

<p>In an official blog post, Paizo prefaces the way they have released <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a> Adventure Paths in the past. They mention the format, releasing a three-part Adventure Path in separate softcover books monthly, was an outgrowth of the company's start publishing <em>Dungeon</em> and <em>Dragon </em>magazine from 2002 to 2007.</p>

As such, the Adventure Path format will change as well. Paizo is still committed to releasing four Adventure Paths per year. The difference is that each Adventure Path will be released in its entirety in one hardcover book, released each quarter.</p>

<p>The reasons for this change to <em>Pathfinder</em> Adventure Paths are numerous and reasonable. First, the logistics of printing multiple books in the current climate have become volatile due to ongoing&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gama-joins-second-anti-tariff-lawsuit-against-trump-administration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a>, so consolidating material into fewer books is a sensible move. Second, the MSRP for these books is $79.99, which is noticeably cheaper than buying three softcover books at an MSRP of $89.99.</p>

<p>Third, having everything in one book is easier for GMs. There's less clutter at the table, less flipping around for a certain chart or statblock, and the GM can read ahead to ensure the adventure is continuing as intended. Lastly, this new model will make reprinting these books easier since they won't have to worry about reformatting the softcover parts.</p>

<p>The first two <em>Pathfinder</em> Adventure Paths being released under this new model will be released in 2026. The first is <em>Hellbreakers</em>, which involves the outbreak of war between the nations of Andoran and Cheliax. The second is <em>Hell's Destiny</em>, the follow-up to <em>Hellbreakers</em>.</p>
