<p>As well as the games themselves, <em>CorgiSpace </em>also offers developer diaries to show you how each game was made. Charmingly, Finji says some of these games "can even save progress". Imagine!</p><p>Games you can check out as part of <em>CorgiSpace </em>include run-based puzzler <em>Kuiper Cargo</em>, "mini roguelike" <em>Cave of Cards</em>, and <em>Mole Mole</em>, a sokoban puzzler with an explosive twist.</p><p>It's not just <em>CorgiSpace </em>Finji is announcing, either. If you're interested in making your own micro-style games, the studio is hosting a game jam between today and January 11th. It'll wrap up with a stream in the week of January 19th, during which Finji staffers and guests will play some of the games created as part of the jam.</p><p>If you want to get a sense for what <em>CorgiSpace </em>will play like and what you can expect from the collection, you can check out a trailer here.</p>
