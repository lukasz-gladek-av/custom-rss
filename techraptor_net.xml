            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced that sales of recent stealth remake&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>have reached a major milestone.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>has managed to surpass a million sales across both physical and digital versions (and, naturally, across all platforms). This, Konami says, "reflects the enduring popularity of the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>series".</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-announced-at-state-of-play" rel="nofollow">faithfully-rendered remake</a> of the original 2004 stealth classic, complete with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-d-snake-eater-remake-reveals-first-spectacular-gameplay-in-unreal" rel="nofollow">revamped visuals and gameplay</a>, as well as new quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p>Changes include a new over-the-shoulder camera mode, as well as the ability to switch between various camo presets on the fly, thus (I think) fixing one of the original game's most irksome problems.</p>

<p>The visuals have also been updated and reworked courtesy of the game's shift to Unreal Engine 5, making for some pretty breathtaking jungle vistas and some rather impressive character model work to boot.</p>

<p>If, however, you're expecting a completely transformative remake along the lines of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, you're going to be disappointed;&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta&nbsp;</em>retains the skeleton of the original game, so it's really just the visuals and gameplay that have been tweaked and improved.</p>




<p>If you're playing on PC or PlayStation 5, you'll also find the classic Snake vs. Monkey mode included, and a new Fox Hunt multiplayer mode is also set to debut on all platforms later this year.</p>

<p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater.algolia/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/metal-gear-solid-d-snake-eater/9pjln214rtkq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yet more industry layoffs have been announced, and this time, it's the turn of&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Midnight Suns&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Civilization VII&nbsp;</em>developer Firaxis Games to let some of its staff members go.</p>

<p>Said layoffs were confirmed by Firaxis' parent company 2K to the folks at <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/2k-confirms-layoffs-at-civilization-developer-firaxis" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>. Of course, 2K describes the staff cuts as the studio "restructur[ing] and optimiz[ing] its development process for adaptability, collaboration, and creativity".</p>

<p>Naturally, 2K stopped short of confirming just how many staff members were laid off, but Game Developer, citing "sources close to the situation", says that "dozens of people" have been let go in this layoff wave.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/firaxis-layoffs-civilization-vii.jpg?itok=tKJ6pqXQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/firaxis-layoffs-civilization-vii.jpg?itok=F_CqJTsn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Civilization VII&nbsp;</em>developer Firaxis Games has been hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>News of layoffs at Firaxis comes after Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-vii-slow-start-take-two" rel="nofollow">admitted last month</a> that&nbsp;<em>Civilization VII&nbsp;</em>had gotten "off to a slow start" in terms of sales and reception. Despite that, however, Zelnick expressed faith in the game, suggesting it had high "lifetime value".</p>

<p><em>Civilization VII&nbsp;</em>was released in February this year, and upon its debut, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">met with a mixed reception</a> from players, who cited a poor user interface and significant gameplay changes compared to previous franchise installments as their reasons for leaving negative reviews.</p>

<p>Firaxis subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">pledged to improve the game</a> and to implement updates based on player feedback, but despite <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-update-110-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">some significant patches</a> arriving since&nbsp;<em>Civilization VII</em>'s launch, it seems this wasn't enough to save these Firaxis employees from the chopping block.</p>

<p>These layoffs aren't even the first that 2K has put into effect this year. Last month, it was reported that&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>studio Cloud Chamber <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-remake-canceled-bioshock-4-story-report" rel="nofollow">had run into difficulties</a> regarding the upcoming&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4</em>, with&nbsp;<em>BioShock Infinite&nbsp;</em>producer Rod Fergusson subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-rod-fergusson" rel="nofollow">confirming his appointment at the studio</a> (as well as layoffs).</p>

Stay tuned for more on this.</p>
