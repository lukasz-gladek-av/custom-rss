            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ravensburger has announced new <em>Disney Villainous</em> expansions for 2026. The latest additions to the asymmetrical competitive board game featuring the baddies of Disney will feature villains from more recent animated movies, as well as a certain spooky entry from the 90s.</p><h2>The Disney Villainous Expansions for 2026</h2><p>According to an official press release, two new <em>Disney Villainous</em> expansions are coming this year. The first is titled <em>Disney Villainous: Success At Any Cost</em>. This expansion will include two playable characters: the double-crossing Prince Hans from <em>Frozen</em>, and the conniving musician from <em>Coco's</em> land of the dead, Ernesto de la Cruz.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Like all playable characters in <em>Disney Villainous</em>, or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-villainous-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Marvel</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-villainous-revenge-at-last-brings-darth-maul-and-captain-phasma-to-table" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars Villainous</em></a>, both Hans and Ernesto will have their own special mechanics. These mechanics are themed around each character, including unique win and lose conditions. The presser doesn't specify what these conditions are, but it can be speculated that both involve playing a long con of some kind without anyone being the wiser.</p><p>For those in the United States, there is a special edition version of <em>Disney Villainous: Success At Any Cost</em>. This version of the game will feature classic papel picado artwork, reminiscent of art seen at Dia de los Muertos festivals, complete with a special finish on Ernesto's mover. The catch is that this version is exclusive to Target. The expansion will be available at an MSRP of $22.99.</p><p>The second <em>Disney Villainous</em> expansion, <em>Disney Villainous: Come, We Fly!,</em> will showcase the witches from the 1990s Halloween movie, <em>Hocus Pocus</em>. The expansion contains one villain, the Sanderson Sisters, complete with their own sculpted mover, unique illustrations, and bespoke mechanics.</p><p>Notably, this is the second <em>Disney Villainous</em> expansion to feature a baddie from a live-action Disney movie. The first was Davy Jones from the Pirates of the Caribbean series.</p><p><em>Disney Villainous: Come, We Fly!</em> will be available in the second half of 2026 at an MSRP of $14.99.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
