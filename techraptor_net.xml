It should come as no surprise, then, that a DLC expansion, <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, has darkened its imposing, slow-to-open doors.</p><p><em>The Forsaken Hollows </em>adds two whole new Nightlords with which to do battle, as well as a host of returning bosses from previous <em>Souls </em>titles (and <em>Elden Ring </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6bfae054-41fd-4b3a-9ec6-070cc0be1a83" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">itself</a>, of course), new enemies, and two new characters to get to grips with as well. It's a solid DLC that packs some meaty challenge, but it's not without its flaws.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Did you like <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>? Well, here's more of it.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To put it simply, despite the experimental nature of <em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em>itself, you shouldn't expect anything too crazy and different from <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>.</p><p>This isn't a <em>Prey: Mooncrash </em>situation, in which the DLC completely transforms the nature of the base game; rather, it's an additional chunk of <em>Nightreign </em>for those who loved their time in Limveld.</p><p>Depending on what you wanted from <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, that may either come as a relief or an unpleasant surprise. For me, it was the former; I rather liked <em>Nightreign</em>, so I was glad for an excuse to be put back under its weird, wonderful spell.</p><p>This DLC's signature feature is its new Shifting Earth condition, which essentially transforms Limveld into a crystal-strewn underground paradise filled with treacherous chasms and precarious bridges.</p><p>It feels like an entirely new map, and when you first head into it, you can expect more than your fair share of confusion and untimely death as you learn its layout and its most optimal routes.</p><p>That's nothing new for <em>Nightreign</em>; although this new map can be a touch more punishing than Limveld proper, it's still just a matter of spending time with <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> until you're familiar with the area's contours and pitfalls.</p><p>Just like <em>Nightreign </em>itself, I'd very strongly recommend taking two friends with you into this DLC rather than relying on the kindness of strangers.</p><p><em>Nightreign </em>feels like it's built for groups who can communicate beyond the rather limited ping system; there's no built-in voice chat, and <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>' intricate map and brutal boss fights (more on which in a moment) demand co-ordination.</p><h2>Boy Howdy, <em>The Forsaken Hollows </em>Sure Is Hard</h2><figure role="group">

<p>The base <em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em>experience was no slouch in the difficulty department, and <em>The Forsaken Hollows </em>ratchets things up to a degree that might test your limits if you found <em>Nightreign </em>itself a challenge.</p><p>The two new Nightlords are fun, engaging additions to <em>Nightreign</em>'s boss canon; one is a group encounter that requires careful observation and management of multiple enemies, while the other is a classic, straightforward Soulslike battle with a fearsome, unpredictable foe.</p><p>They're tough, and they can test unprepared builds, but things really come to a head in the closing battles of each night prior to facing the Nightlords.</p><p>They contain some of <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s most terrifyingly difficult fights, and if you're unprepared, you might find yourself scuppered. Expect to be thwarted at the end of day two more often than you're beaten by the Nightlords themselves.</p><p>That's fine in <em>Elden Ring </em>itself - or, indeed, any Soulslike with a liberal checkpoint system - but <em>Nightreign</em>'s boss run is essentially two entire in-game day cycles of exploring Limveld, so it can feel frustrating to fall at the final hurdle, knowing you'll have to repeat everything that's come before just for a chance to try again.</p><p>This is another reason you're going to want Nightfarers whom you trust by your side. Limveld isn't playing around, and players who don't know <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>' encounters can quickly be overwhelmed by its punishing difficulty.</p><h2>There Isn't Quite Enough in <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em></h2><figure role="group">

<p>Of course, punishing difficulty and bosses that reward careful observation and planning are part and parcel of the Soulslike experience, so even though <em>The Forsaken Hollows </em>pushes things just a tad too far, it's still got some worthy additions to FromSoftware's boss canon.</p><p>The problem is that there just aren't quite enough of them. I counted eight new end-of-night bosses, all of whom return from either the original <em>Elden Ring</em>, its DLC, or a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-souls-iii" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="668e9b25-a2a4-4068-948b-f4cadb234f16" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Dark Souls </em>title</a> (or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-souls-iii-ringed-city-dlc-announced" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9443ea1d-c1c8-4ffe-b9e9-889600c1099e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">associated DLC</a> thereof).</p><p>That might sound like a lot at first, but things quickly get repetitive, and it wasn't long before I was sighing in disappointment at the same encounter being laid before me for the sixth or seventh time in a row.</p><p>I have no knowledge of the technical side of things, but I can't imagine it would have been too much work to throw a few more <em>Elden Ring </em>or <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>bosses into this DLC, and it would have gone a long way towards alleviating the repetition.</p><p>There are also no new weapons on offer, which feels like a bizarre and unfortunate oversight. Creating new builds and finding fun synergies was a big part of <em>Nightreign</em>, so the fact that there's no new red meat for the crazy theorycrafters is a shame.</p><p>Two new characters are available to play in <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, and for me, one was significantly more interesting than the other.</p><p>The Undertaker is...well, she's fine. Perhaps I haven't grasped the nuances of the play style yet, but she prioritizes aggression and damage, which is okay. She's a perfectly acceptable addition to <em>Nightreign</em>'s roster, but I didn't find her particularly interesting.</p><p>However, the Scholar is a much more intriguing prospect. He's a support strategist, a role that none of <em>Nightreign</em>'s other classes fulfil, and his abilities are powerful for a co-ordinated party that knows what it's doing.</p><p>Neither of these characters is quite enough to stave off <em>The Forsaken Hollows </em>feeling samey after a while, and they won't transform the game completely, but they're a fun enough diversion.</p><h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2><figure role="group">

<figcaption>There is new stuff to see in <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>...just not quite enough of it.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows </em>is a worthwhile addition to the base game.&nbsp;</p><p>Its new bosses are fun, its underground crystal area is atmospheric (if daunting), and hey, it's an excuse to head back into the excellent <em>Nightreign </em>itself.&nbsp;</p><p>I just wish there was more of it, because repetition sets in far more quickly than I'd have liked. More weapons, a few more bosses, and perhaps one more Nightlord would have made this a must-play.&nbsp;</p><p>As it is, if you loved <em>Nightreign</em>, check this out, but if you're hoping for a <em>Mooncrash </em>or <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>-style revelation, you're better off sleeping through this particular night.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows</strong> was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of around 14 hours of gameplay.
