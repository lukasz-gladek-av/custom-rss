            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed <em>Fantastical Parade</em>, the new expansion for smash hit mobile game <em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, and it's bringing some beautiful-looking new cards next week.</p><p><em>Fantastical Parade </em>is a full-scale expansion along the lines of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-crimson-blaze-expansion" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="36d1e739-eceb-481f-8fe3-e1b1e416796b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">December's <em>Crimson Blaze</em></a> rather than a booster pack like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-secluded-springs-booster-pack" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="acf203ba-9aa5-49ad-a09c-824028b91eb5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Secluded Springs</em></a>, so you can look forward to lots of new cards to transform your <em>Pokemon TCG Pocket </em>experience, plus a whole new mechanic to wrestle with.</p><p>Let's start with the new cards. Following the introduction of Mega Evolved Pokemon in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising-expansion" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="446a5765-68fb-444f-81b3-a28fe16d26cf" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">October's <em>Mega Rising </em>expansion</a>, <em>Fantastical Parade </em>is adding a number of new Mega Evolutions to the mix, including new ex cards for Mega Gardevoir, Mega Mawile, and Mega Ogerpon.</p><figure role="group">

<p>You can also look forward to regular cards for adorable 'mons like Vanillite and Pumpkaboo, as well as new Trainer cards like the Retreat Cost-lowering Peculiar Plaza and the Energy-sapping Piers.</p><p>As for that new mechanic, Stadiums are "a new type of Trainer card that can turn the tide of battle", according to The Pokemon Company. The aforementioned Peculiar Plaza card is a Stadium addition, and it's "especially tricky to handle for players using Psychic-type Pokemon", apparently.</p><p><em>Fantastical Parade </em>is also packing a suite of new covers themed around expansion mascot Gardevoir. Those covers won't become available the moment the expansion drops, though; they'll be released starting from January 31st.</p><p>You can check out a trailer that shows off some of <em>Fantastical Parade</em>'s lovely new cards, as well as its overall art style and aesthetic direction, right here.</p>
<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket </em>celebrated its first anniversary back in October, and the game is showing no signs of slowing down in popularity terms; it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-150m-downloads" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d4523980-f16a-4232-9832-cd9a059bc4c1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">amassed over 150 million downloads so far</a> and seems to be serving as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dena-revenue" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4dc7c5cf-dbfd-4e98-a7fd-ad4b5bf18cd3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">nice little moneyspinner</a> for DeNA and The Pokemon Company.</p><p>You can download <em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em> for free right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iOS</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Nacon and developer Spiders have announced that their action RPG sequel <em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World </em>will launch in full on PC and consoles in March.</p><p>As revealed in a brand new trailer, <em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World </em>will be hitting PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on March 12th, having been in Early Access for the last <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a936cedb-778a-48c2-a788-07da845a360a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">year and a half or so</a>.</p><p>Since launching in September 2024, <em>GreedFall 2 </em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-early-access-roadmap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="70a6d13b-4284-4869-8f2d-989e1b544615" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">received a number of updates</a>, bringing features like new companions, quests, and story elements, as well as a crafting system, a new skill tree, and more.

<p>In practice, some Steam reviewers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_The_Dying_World/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">beg to differ</a>. <em>GreedFall 2 </em>has amassed a Mixed rating across over 500 reviews since its Early Access launch, and even more recent opinions point to what players perceive as game-breaking bugs, unfinished systems, and iffy optimization.</p><p>Of course, there's a good chance that Spiders and Nacon can turn around <em>GreedFall 2 </em>and fix its issues in time for launch in March; there are, after all, two months between now and then, which should be enough time to at least iron out some of the more troubling-sounding problems.</p><p>However, given that Spiders was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1d57ded4-a6cf-40e0-93cb-59588606ff42" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs in July last year</a>, the studio is operating at a reduced capacity compared to when <em>GreedFall 2 </em>launched, so you might want to temper your expectations accordingly if you're going to pick the game up on PS5 or Xbox.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World</em>, it is, as the name implies, the sequel to the 2019 RPG <em>GreedFall</em>, although it's actually a prequel.</p>
<p><em>GreedFall 2 </em>once again revolves around notions of colonialism and exploitation; this time, you're playing as a Teer Fradee native, who must navigate political intrigue and deadly fauna across the open world of Gacane.</p><p><em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World </em>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_The_Dying_World/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010517" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/greedfall-ii-the-dying-world/9P2SLNTMLJ2Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 12th.
