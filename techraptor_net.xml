            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/building-ultimate-captain-america-first-avenger-mtg-deck<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Magic and Marvel are coming together, starting with five secret lairs that are releasing in early November. Five iconic Marvel characters are getting unique <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>cards in their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-magic-gathering-marvel-crossover-details-revealed-including-new-secret-lair-and" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" New Magic: The Gathering Marvel Crossover Details Revealed, Including new Secret Lair and Set">own secret lairs</a>, paired up with reskins or new arts of other cards to complement them.</p>

<p>A Secret Lair gives you some good cards, but we’re going to go through how to build a Marvel MTG deck around the commanders, starting with Captain America, First Avenger</p>

<h3>Examining Captain America, First Avenger</h3>



<p>Our first step is to examine Cap, who is appropriately Red, White, and Blue (in a nice flavor nod, they rearranged the normal order of color display from blue, red, white to fit the traditional America order). He comes with a solid body as a 3 mana 4/4 and has two abilities, in ‘Throw…’ and ‘…Catch’.</p>

<p>Throw… is the more unique ability of the two, letting you unattach an equipment to deal damage equal to the equipment’s mana value divided among up to three targets. Few cards have ever used <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=o%3Aunattach&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="List of cards that have Unattach in their text">unattach in rules text</a>, and none ever in this way. As for …Catch it is a free equip trigger, letting you give Captain America a piece of equipment at the beginning of combat on your turn at no cost.</p>

<p>What this shows us is a commander who is equipment focused, like any number of Boros commanders. Part of what makes Captain America special is that he adds blue to the mix, opening up new cards for this archetype. Combine that with providing a potentially unique take on the archetype, Captain America, the First Avenger provides an interesting tweak on a well known archetype.</p>

<h3>Captain America’s Equipment</h3>



<p>It’s time to suit up Captain America! There are a lot of equipment that can be included but I’m going to focus on a handful that you should look at including in your own Captain America deck.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/72/excalibur-sword-of-eden" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Excalibur, Sword of Eden">Excalibur, Sword of Eden </a>is from the <em>Assassin’s Creed Universes Beyond </em>set, and is the highest mana value equipment in Magic: The Gathering. It also comes down cheaper based on other historic permanents you control (aka legendary cards, saga’s and artifacts). It is perfect for Captain America, First Avenger to throw, but it’s also good for him to wield in combat as it gives the equipped creature +10/+0 and vigilance.</p>

<p>Sword of War and Peace is an automatic inclusion, in its <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/1730/sword-of-war-and-peace" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Shield of War and Peace">Shield of War and Peace</a> styling that comes with the secret lair. You’ll probably want to include at least one other <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=otag%3Asword-of-x-and-y" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Swords of X and Ys">Sword of X and Y</a>, as they are very good. I recommend <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/124/sword-of-feast-and-famine" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sword of Feast and Famine">Sword of Feast and Famine</a> in particular as it untapped lands when you deal damage to an opponent, letting you do some more throwing post-combat or cast more spells, and gives protection from green and black.</p>



<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/rvr/260/illusionists-bracers" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Illusionist's Bracers">Illusionist’s Bracers</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/c21/48/battlemages-bracers" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Battlemage's Bracers">Battlemage’s Bracers</a> are for doubling activating abilities. These are helpful for getting more out of Captain’s Throw… ability, making it far more lethal. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/td2/74/grafted-exoskeleton" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Grafted Exoskeleton">Grafted Exoskeleton </a>is a way to turn those throws into extra lethality by making that damage all poisonous, letting only ten damage wipe out a foe - one Excalibur toss becomes lethal.</p>

<h3>Captain America’s Support</h3>

<p>To get Captain America to battle takes more than just a few weapons however. Luckily, there’s no lack of support that we can supply for him.</p>



<p>With one piece of equipment we really want in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/72/excalibur-sword-of-eden" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Excalibur, Sword of Eden">Excalibur, Sword of Eden</a>, we need quartermaster’s to fetch the goods. That’s why we are looking at tutors like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/31/stoneforge-mystic" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Stoneforge Mystic">Stoneforge Mystic</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/230/kellan-the-fae-blooded-birthright-boon" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Kellan, the Fae Blooded">Kellan, The Fae-Blooded</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/59/steelshapers-gift" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Steelshaper's Gift">Steelshaper’s Gift</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/34/open-the-armory" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Open the Armory">Open the Armory</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mrd/35/fabricate" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fabricate">Fabricate</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/afr/222/fighter-class" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fighter Class">Fighter Class</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmr/6/enlightened-tutor" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Enlightened Tutor">Enlightened Tutor</a>. These all can grab Excalibur, or whichever piece of equipment is most useful at any given moment.</p>

<p>For other equipment support we’re looking to a mix of creatures, and enchantments to get extra value, cheapen the cost and return them. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/17/forge-anew" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Forge Anew">Forge Anew </a>is a staple of equipment decks for good reason, resurrecting one equipment, giving instant-speed equipping, and giving you a free equip each turn. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/698/puresteel-paladin" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Puresteel Paladin">Puresteel Paladin</a> lets us draw cards for playing them (just like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/nec/88/sram-senior-edificer" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sram, Senior Edificer">Sram</a>, who’s also invited to the party), and skip equipment costs as long as we have three or more artifacts.</p>



<p>Reinforcing Captain America, First Avenger we also bring <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mul/65/zirda-the-dawnwaker" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Zirda the Dawnwaker">Zirda, the Dawnwaker </a>to cheapen the cost of his ability, and of all of the equip costs. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otj/203/ertha-jo-frontier-mentor" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Ertha Jo, Frontier mentor">Ertha Jo, Frontier Mentor</a> provides another ability doubler, as well as a pair of bodies to pick up dropped equipment. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/14/codsworth-handy-helper" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Codsworth, Handy Helper">Codsworth, Handy Helper</a> is an under the radar helper as well, as it can freely equip things once a turn, gives Captain America Ward 2, and can tap for two mana to play equipment.</p>

<p>Captain America also needs protection, and for that a mixture of creatures and instants come to mind, in addition to some equipment you can include. In the realm of creature cards, there’s the likes of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/33/skrelv-defector-mite" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Skrelv, Defector Mite">Skrelv, Defector Mite</a> (who I prefer here over <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/clb/702/mother-of-runes" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Mother of Runes">Mother of Runes </a>due to being an artifact, and a legendary creature), and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/669/pippin-guard-of-the-citadel" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Pippin, Guard of the Citadel ">Pippin, Guard of the Citadel</a> who can cheaply stop removal spells. A relatively new option is <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/240/hydroelectric-specimen-hydroelectric-laboratory" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Hydroelectric Specimen">Hydroelectric Specimen </a>which can redirect a single target spell to itself, and as a modal dual-faced card, is optionally playable as a land instead.</p>



<p>Spellwise we have some counterspells and protection spells. The counterspell suite should look at <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/110/arcane-denial" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Arcane Denial">Arcane Denial</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/114/counterspell" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Counterspell">Counterspell</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/94/fierce-guardianship" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fierce Guardianship">Fierce Guardianship</a>, and the modal card <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/241/sink-into-stupor-soporific-springs" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sink into Stupor">Sink into Stupor </a>(another bonus land option), though you can modify this for your preferred counterspells, with the focus being stopping spells that can remove Captain America or key equipment. Protection spells should complement that and include options like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/32/teferis-protection" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Teferi's Protection">Teferi’s Protection</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/1728/flawless-maneuver" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Flawless Maneuver">Flawless Maneuver</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/znr/37/sejiri-shelter-sejiri-glacier" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sejiri Shelter">Sejiri Shelter</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/Deflecting%20Swat" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/214/deflecting-swat">Deflecting Swat</a>.</p>

<p>Using what's above I made an example list, and included a list of later cuts in the maybeboard. Here is <a href="https://archidekt.com/decks/9743049/captain_america" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Captain America Deck">the list </a>for your use to consider ideas for your own list.</p>

<h2>Budget Marvel MTG Options For Captain America, First Avenger</h2>

<p>A lot of the options above aren’t necessarily the cheapest so let’s do a quick budget ($2.00 or less) rundown of cards for some areas.</p>

<p>Hopefully all of this helps you build the best Captain America, First Avenger deck to lead against all the challengers you will face.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/runemasters-review-punishingly-fun<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What is it about sacred temples that make them such juicy targets for roving monsters and villains? That’s a question you… won’t have time to answer in <i>Runemasters</i>, a new <a href="https://funforge.fr/en/products/runemasters">cooperative game by Funforge</a>. I’ve been on a real hot streak reviewing great new board games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/chandigarh-board-game-review-colorful-and-think-y"><i>Chandigarh</i></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/botanicus-review-it-grows-on-you"><i>Botanicus</i></a>, and now the good folks at Flat River Group sent me the slim-but-tricky <i>Runemasters </i>to check out, so follow along for my <i>Runemasters</i> Review!</p>

<h2>What Is <i>Runemasters</i>, And How Do You Play<i>?</i></h2>

<p>Designed by Antoine Prono with illustrations by Paul Mafayon, Théo Guillot, and Adrien Martinez, <i>Runemasters</i> is a cooperative tower defense game for 1 - 4 players, where players take on the role of guardians protecting a temple from hordes of enemies. Each of the four guardians has a different distinct special ability and ultimate power, which you’ll need to use against the incoming threat.</p>

<p>And believe me, that threat will, indeed, be incoming! One of the things I find most interesting about <i>Runemasters </i>is that it is, quite simply put, extremely punishing. I feel like many cooperative games, over the past five years or so, have softened their difficulty levels. This makes sense when so many of them are more narratively driven, inviting users to explore a world and story.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-1.jpeg?itok=CikAl8Pi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-1.jpeg?itok=gRAE-BMw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each hero brings unique skills to the table... will they be enough?</figcaption></figure><p>But sometimes you just want to bash your head against a wall in a coop game that’ll leave your gaming group in shambles, like <i>Pandemic</i> or <i>Spirit Island</i>. <i>Runemasters</i>, I’m happy to report, is a return to that classic form.</p>

<p>In the game, you’ll flip over cards depicting monsters and place them on a colored track that matches their card color. Each turn, they’ll move one space closer to the temple, and automatically deal damage to any hero blocking their path. If no hero’s on the path, they’ll damage the temple. If all your heroes die, or the temple takes too much damage, you lose!</p>

<p>To defeat these monsters, you’ll roll custom six-sided dice. The dice allow you to deal a point of damage to the first enemy in your track if one of their “weak points” matches a symbol you rolled. Or you can use those symbols to power up your ultimate power, perform a special ability, or swap spaces with another guardian.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-dice-rolls.jpeg?itok=ltun32no 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-dice-rolls.jpeg?itok=YO5WLgUv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dice rolled can be used to damage an enemy's weak spots, move, and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Defeat most of the monsters in the stack of monster cards, and you’ll reveal the Dawn card - if you survive with at least one hero still on the board, you win!</p>

<h2>The Pleasure Of Difficulty In <i>Runemasters</i></h2>

<p>Maybe I’m a chronically bad dice roller (FACT), but it was such a challenge to get the right symbols at the right time. There are many clever, interlocking mechanics in this little game that add to your strategic options - you can spend the dice you roll to build a wall, or expend mana points to re-roll dice - but I was still left struggling again and again.</p>

<p>But I want to be clear: <i>this is not a bad thing</i>! Cooperative games in this style have lead to some of the most fun, joyfully anguishing moments in my gaming career, and when we finally did beat the game after multiple tries, we were left feeling utterly triumphant. I really enjoy the way the game doesn’t overload you with options, while still managing to give you a few key tools in your hero’s toolkit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-2.jpeg?itok=bGcYfnQL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-2.jpeg?itok=L3wS_IGj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ismoros's ability to shield heroes from enemies is not to be overlooked.</figcaption></figure><p>The one major downside with <i>Runemasters</i>, however, is also intrinsically tied to the difficulty and design of the game - and that’s player elimination (Boo! Hiss!). In this game, if your hero is killed - that’s it, you’re done! One of the heroes can resurrect other characters twice in the game, but A. that takes a lot of work to build up the magic power to do so and B. if <i>that</i> hero dies, there’s no resurrection happening.</p>

<p>I would like to see a mechanic where you come back after you die, but suffer some sort of penalty. Even if the penalty imposed made the game equally as hard as losing a character, at least that player wouldn’t have to sit around and wait for everyone else to finish the game. In most cooperative games, if your character dies the entire game is a loss (that’s how they do it in the gloriously chunky <i>Cthulhu: Death May Die</i>, which is of course an entirely differently scoped game, but I just played it so it’s fresh in my mind).</p>

<p>The flip side to this, which solves the problem of player death, is that this game can just as easily be played solo mode. You don’t need to make any adjustments, and if one of your characters dies, you’ve still got plenty of game to go!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-enemy-lineup_0.jpeg?itok=anGLWXt5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-enemy-lineup_0.jpeg?itok=igqRqZYZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We're in big trouble here, we've lost a hero (who would be occupying the yellow space) and monsters are backed up on the green path!</figcaption></figure><h2>The Artwork And Components Of <i>Runemasters</i></h2>

<p>The illustrators Paul Mafayon, Théo Guillot, and Adrien Martinez have truly outdone themselves with the quirky, angular designs on all of these cards. The heroes look extremely stylized and have a lot of kinetic movement to them, the monsters are all great renderings of classic dungeon threats, and there’s overall a clean, unfussy look to the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-enemy-cards_0.jpeg?itok=cCsQ79ff 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-enemy-cards_0.jpeg?itok=1xlKmjgp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Enemy cards and event cards show off the distinctive illustrated style of the game.</figcaption></figure><p>The components are sturdy cardboard, with all heroes coming as cardboard standees and all villains represented by cards. This isn’t really a game where you need detailed miniatures, and it keeps the price nice and slim at around $30 at most retailers.</p>

<h2><i>Runemasters </i>Review - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>If you’re looking for a game that’s going to challenge your gaming group, and love a little slash and dash dice-chucking, you won’t find much better out right now than <i>Runemasters</i>. But be warned, player elimination means that you may be sitting by the wayside while your friends are still in the temple trying to defeat a blue dragon! With superior artwork, clean game design, and a high degree of difficulty, <i>Runemasters</i> is a must-try to brave adventurers out there.</p>

Last week we got to sit down with Shire and Alex Uboldi, Game Production Manager at Darrington Press, to talk about the new expansion including the new playable Princesses, how they balanced each character, and whether any more ideas are bouncing around in Shire’s Head.</p>

<p>Before hopping into the interview it’s important to explain that <em>Queen By Midnight</em> is a deckbuilding game where players take on the role of Princesses fighting for a chance to become Queen. Spend Clout to purchase cards from your character deck, or the shared bazaar, to build up your strength and defeat all of the other princesses before the clock strikes midnight.</p>

<h2>The Inception And Collaboration Behind <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em></h2>

<p>To begin our interview Shire introduced himself and the history of development for<em> Queen By Midnight.</em> “The TLDR is wayback in the day I had this weird idea for a card game that I had kicking around for a very long time. I was working full time for a company that rhymes with shmeshminima and didn’t really think anything was going to come from [<em>Queen By Midnight]</em> and when shmeshminima went shmesmwaway I had a bunch of time on my hands and I needed to fill it with something to do. This game became my reason to get out of bed in the morning for the longest time.”</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//y8Vj_uhNKPA"></iframe></p>

<p>After some time, and returning to work, Shire explained that he had continued to work on it behind the scenes until the creation of Darrington Press as the game publishing arm of Critical Role was created. “Darrington Press came along I pitched it to Ivan and thank got someone as talented and wonderful as Alex Uboldi came along and managed to fish all of the good threads out of my tangled mess and managed to make a really great game, and now another one.”</p>

<p>Uboldi hopped in to offer his side of this meeting “When I started at Darrington Press one of the first projects that was handed to me was the original <em>Queen By Midnight</em>. I took it and I played it with a bunch of different groups and every group I played it with loved the game”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Every group I played it with loved the game so I’m like ‘Ok, there’s something special here’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“It was a lot of my job to basically help develop the art, the graphic design, go through all of the cards and make sure there was consistency,” Alex spoke further on his input to the creation of the finished product that we know today. “Basically it was bringing Kyle’s vision to life in the most beautiful way possible.”</p>

<p>I asked Shire what it was like having that game, that he was working on in the backburner become such a success, he said “It’s been a dream come true. Any single time I am able to go into a game store and see my game, and talk to game store owners and people playing it, and get their feedback there’s no greater feeling.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I love hearing all the stories of people saying ‘I won with this character, and I really want to try these other characters’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shire and Uboldi shared a common appreciation of hearing peoples stories of winning the game. Whether it be a slow burn through the game, taking out specific Princesses immediately, or using an ability to steal everyone’s Clout etc.</p>

<p>Uboldi admitted “Those stories of people playing the game, that’s why I really do this.”</p>

<h2>How To Build A Princess</h2>

<p>When Shire brought the game to Uboldi and the Darrington Press team he already had a lot of ideas for the Princesses, how they would perform uniquely, and what kind of personality they would have.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board_0.jpg?itok=M0jQriZg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board_0.jpg?itok=VjnhS9aK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Azil With A Z is a new Princess for <em>Quarter Past</em></figcaption></figure><p>“We did a lot of working together to make sure the Princesses felt like they were their identities, they developed in cool and interesting ways. Neither of us expected as we were bouncing ideas off each other that these Princesses would develop into fully fledged characters that both of us are happy with.”</p>

<p>Speaking to the expansion Uboldi explained that the process was very similar “We wanted to make the expansion for this game because we love this world and we want to see more from it. Kyle laid out all of the design for the four new pricesses.” At that time Shire already had ideas for the vibes of each of these new Princesses as well as their mechanics to make them a unique play experience at the table.</p>



<p>Four new Princesses have been added as part of <em>Quarter Past</em>; Elise LeKraken, Azil With A Z, Kahurere Skyfisher, and Qasima Al-Basar.</p>

<p>Talking on the inspirations for these characters Shire explained that "if Ursula is to Devine, then you will have Elise LeKraken to Monet X Change. Dialing back to the original conceit behind Ursula and making that the focal point for our mermaid princess is just absolutely inspired."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For more on the mechanics and gameplay style for each of these new Princesses you can check out our full review of <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Azil With A Z is our wonderful nod to Alice in Wonderland. Our absurdist and surreal princess. Her whole vibe is that she's the only princess who has access to all three classes. I always tell people that she's the chaos character, if you're not interested in winning but want to cause a bunch of chaos you've got to play Azil."</p>

<p>Uboldi continued describing the characters talking about Qasima Al-Basar "who is our Princess Jasmine meeds Aladdin analog. By day she's a princess and by night she's a vigilante who protects her kingdom personally. We wanted to create a character who felt like she hed a lot of tools for espionage, but if she needs to she doles out great damage."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-character-decks_0.jpg?itok=4FAHv1II 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-character-decks_0.jpg?itok=tEXcy-me 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each Princess has their own unique deck and playstyle</figcaption></figure><p>The last of the new characters is Kahurere Skyfisher who doesn't want to be Queen, but she wants to bring the whole system down. "She is Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia meets Moana. Because she doesn't have this grand kingdom she has to use more covert means. Her mechanic is laying traps for all the other Princesses. They can either keep the traps in their hand to be a dead card or play the trap to draw another card, but the trap will do something to help Skyfisher"</p>

<p>This deck is all about the other players making choices to have benefits together, or working against one another. Uboldi explained that what drew him to liking this character was that it's very "Interactive. It lets you talk to the whole table and it involves everyone and that's where the game is it's most fun"</p>

<p>While all four of these characters have their own unique mechanics Shire did explain that they designed each to be a far more aggressive character, making big moves quickly.</p>

<h2>There Might Be Two Lost Princesses?</h2>

<p>Interestingly when talking about how he came up with the original concepts for the Princesses that the first game would have twelve Princesses. "So I had cooked up rough ideas for 12 princesses, eventually I thought it was madness and cut it down to six that I felt like were the six most well baked out of them."</p>

<p>From the other six they were included in Shire's original draft of the first game for potential expansions and four of those are what we can now play. When asked if we would see these two final Princesses Shire said "I don't know, we'll have to figure that out, I have an idea but we'll see…" as Uboldi shrugged.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-clock_0.jpg?itok=h3MVrdxX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-clock_0.jpg?itok=yACaCTQb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Instead of the full clocktower <em>Quarter Past</em> tracks the game with this more portable alternative</figcaption></figure><h2>Creating Balance Across The Lands</h2>

<p>As each Princess has their own unique deck and you can now play with up to ten Princesses I was curious to understand how they approached balancing so many characters. Having already created the prior six helped them have a good baseline. Uboldi explained that "We looked at the original princesses and the baseline power level. We scaled everything to match that power level, but because we were making these changes to the core deck it changes the dynamic of these princesses to be much more aggressive."</p>

<p>By not having the ability to block an attack, it allowed them to design the pricesses to be more aggressive knowing that they're also more vulnerable to attacks.</p>

<p>"Against each other they felt very balanced, but against the Core Set Princesses there was interesting gameplay for the Princesses who are holding off an assault and trying to go over the top or Princesses who are trying to race down their opponents."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-errata-cards_0.jpg?itok=vni-9QJo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-errata-cards_0.jpg?itok=6ECpO2BL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This expansion also contains errata cards for the base version so you can play it in it's 'best' form</figcaption></figure><h2>Expansion As Well As Standalone</h2>

<p>Many board games when expanding a roster of playable characters would simply release a character expansion and move on. For <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em> I was impressed that not only was this four new playable characters that interact with one another but that it came with all that that you need to play it on it's own.</p>

<p>Uboldi explained that for Darrington Press they understood that the base game retailing at $70 that was a high price point for something you might not like. "We designed <em>Quarter Past</em> as a great entry place for newer players"</p>

<p>"We really wanted it to work well on it's own, we even designed the Princesses and Bazaar cards to be simpler but mechanically deep to make this as approachable for a new entry player as possible."</p>
