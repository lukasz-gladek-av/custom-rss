            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lucas-pope-moida-mansion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legendary indie<em>&nbsp;</em>developer Lucas Pope has released&nbsp;<em>Moida Mansion</em>, a brand new game inspired by Tiger Electronics handhelds and <em>Game &amp; Watch&nbsp;</em>that you can play right now on PC.</p>

<p>Pope is perhaps best known for the likes of maritime detective game&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/return-of-obra-dinn">Return of the Obra Dinn</a>&nbsp;</em>and oppressive document-checking simulator&nbsp;<em>Papers, Please</em>, but&nbsp;<em>Moida Mansion</em> has an altogether different tone, as you've probably guessed from the humorously phonetic spelling of "murder" in the title.</p>

<p>On <em>Moida Mansion</em>'s <a href="https://dukope.itch.io/moida-mansion" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Itch.io page</a>, it's presented as a charmingly old-school handheld throwback, with the screen surrounded by character artwork and some properly chunky-looking retro buttons (which you'll need to click to interact with the game).</p>

<p>The game is also accompanied by a delightful 80s-style instruction manual; in fact, Pope himself <a href="https://x.com/dukope/status/1852057229438128510" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> that&nbsp;<em>Moida Mansion&nbsp;</em>was "a good excuse to make a very 80s instruction manual", apologizing to any players "struggling through [his] youth here".</p>

<p>You play as a member of the Adventure Club, an intrepid group of kids who have wandered into the titular mansion in order to find a wayward turtle mascot. Unfortunately, you're not alone in the mansion, and so you must look for your missing friends while also avoiding a "terrible monsta".</p>

<p>You'll need to search through objects to find your friends, and rooms in the mansion often contain secrets or hidden passages as well. Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Moida Mansion&nbsp;</em>"is constantly changing", as Pope says, so each run won't be the same.</p>

<p>You can play&nbsp;<em>Moida Mansion&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via Itch.io, and you can also find some of Lucas Pope's <a href="https://dukope.itch.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">other work there</a> if you're interested in checking that out.</p>
