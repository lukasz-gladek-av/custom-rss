            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo of America president and COO Doug Bowser (yes, really) has announced he will step down from the company at the end of the year, and his replacement has already been appointed by the Japanese gaming giant.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Bowser, who has spent "more than a decade in multiple leadership positions" at Nintendo, will retire from the studio on December 31st. He'll be replaced by current marketing executive VP Devon Pritchard, who will also be joining the NOA board of directors.</p>

<p>Additionally, Nintendo's American division will gain Satoru Shibata as its CEO, although he'll be continuing to serve as managing exec and corporate director of Nintendo as a whole as well. That's a heck of a lot of plates to juggle.</p>

<p>Fils-Aime was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/reggie-fils-aime-inducted-into-video-game-hall-of-fame" rel="nofollow">inducted into the International Video Game Hall of Fame</a> in October that same year, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/reggie-fils-aime-joins-gamestops-board-of-directors" rel="nofollow">join GameStop's board of directors</a> shortly before the pandemic began (and around ten months before the whole <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamestop-stock-trading-halted-due-to-sudden-spike" rel="nofollow">GameStop stock debacle</a> kicked off).</p>

<p>Bowser hasn't revealed what he's intending to do next, but he did express pride in what he'd achieved during his time with Nintendo, "in both business results and the experience we've created for consumers".</p>

<p>He also praised his replacement, Devon Pritchard, calling her "exceptional" and pointing to her promotion as "a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to [Nintendo's] growth".</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what Bowser does next, but given the way corporate America works, I'd be very surprised indeed if we don't see him popping up on another board of directors somewhere. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Recettear and Trails Localizer Andrew Dice Passes Away]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/andrew-dice-death-carpe-fulgur</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/recettear-and-trails-localizer-andrew-dice-passes-away.1309692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Andrew Dice, perhaps better known as one half of the localization studio Carpe Fulgur, has passed away, and his partner has declared that the studio is ceasing operations as a result of his untimely death.</p>

<p>News of Dice's death was <a href="https://x.com/BlondRobin/status/1971245608184000738" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">shared on social media</a>&nbsp;by fellow Carpe Fulgur founder Robin Light-Williams, who simply announced that their "friend and business partner Andrew Dice...has passed away", and that "pursuant" to Dice's death, "Carpe Fulgur will be ceasing operations".</p>

<p>Light-Williams didn't share any cause of death for Dice, and there hasn't been an official announcement regarding his death from anyone else close to him either (at least, not a public-facing announcement).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/recettear-localizer-andrew-dice-passes-away-game_0.jpg?itok=RLLg80nd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/recettear-localizer-andrew-dice-passes-away-game_0.jpg?itok=4NCUO5Zd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Andrew Dice, together with partner Robin Light-Williams, was responsible for the localization of 2010's&nbsp;<em>Recettear</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you haven't heard Dice or Carpe Fulgur's name, you'd probably know them from some of their work. Their first foray into localization was 2010's&nbsp;<em>Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale</em>, which marries dungeon exploration with shop management in a similar way to 2018's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/moonlighter" rel="nofollow"><em>Moonlighter</em></a>.</p>

<p>Following&nbsp;<em>Recettear</em>, developer EasyGameStation released&nbsp;<em>Chantelise - A Tale of Two Sisters&nbsp;</em>in 2011, and Carpe Fulgur provided localization services for that game as well, in addition to Japanese developer Lizsoft's game&nbsp;<em>Fortune Summoners: Secret of the Elemental Stone</em>.</p>

<p>You may also know Carpe Fulgur from its assistance with the translation of 2015's worldwide release of&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC</em>, although personal struggles prevented Dice and Carpe Fulgur from seeing the project through to its conclusion.</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak&nbsp;</em>project manager <a href="https://x.com/Hatsuu/status/1971367628389351701" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Leona Renee</a>, he and Carpe Fulgur were also engaged in translating that game, so it sounds like Carpe Fulgur might have been ramping things back up prior to Dice's passing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails-through-daybreak-carpe-fulgur-andrew-dice.jpg?itok=MP0pam6p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails-through-daybreak-carpe-fulgur-andrew-dice.jpg?itok=6o5A77Ym 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dice and Carpe Fulgur apparently worked on&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak&nbsp;</em>prior to the former's death.</figcaption></figure><p>As far as we know, Dice, Light-Williams, and Carpe Fulgur were not involved in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/recettear-hd-2025" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Recettear&nbsp;</em>remaster</a> (at least, not in a capacity beyond their involvement in the original), and it's unclear whether the game will use their original translation or sport a new one.</p>

<p>It's fair to say Dice and his studio were extremely influential in the localization of hitherto-underexposed Japanese games, so his passing will likely be felt in the industry for some time to come. My thoughts go out to his friends and family at this difficult time.</p>
