            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nihon-falcom-chairman-masayuki-kato-dies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nihon Falcom founder and chairman Masayuki Kato has passed away at the age of 78, the studio has revealed. His cause of death has not been stated.</p>

<p>Per an announcement by Nihon Falcom (with translation from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1hg50yo/comment/m2gmzk3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit user TheBlueDolphina</a>), Kato died on December 15th, which is also when he "resigned from his position as Director" at the company. That might sound obvious, but I'm guessing confirming this is some kind of requirement with regards to corporate structure.</p>

<p>Kato's death will be marked by a funeral and a wake that are open only to close family members "in accordance with the wishes of the bereaved family", Nihon Falcom's statement reads. The studio is also "respectfully" declining condolence gifts or physical messages of sympathy.</p>

<p>The company's early games would prove hugely influential in shaping the then-nascent JRPG and action RPG genres; with franchises like&nbsp;<em>Ys</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Slayer</em>, the company arguably laid the groundwork for later giants like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>.</p>

<p>Today, Nihon Falcom is perhaps best known for the still-ongoing&nbsp;<em>Ys&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes&nbsp;</em>franchises, the latter of which has birthed the popular&nbsp;<em>Trails&nbsp;</em>sub-series to which luminaries like&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Trails of Cold Steel&nbsp;</em>belong.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nihon-falcom-trails-of-cold-steel.jpg?itok=9K48phDZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nihon-falcom-trails-of-cold-steel.jpg?itok=MZqYu2jc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Trails&nbsp;</em>sub-series is just one of Nihon Falcom's exports.</figcaption></figure><p>While Kato remained the chairman of Nihon Falcom, he wasn't its president; that role is filled by Toshihiro Kondo, who said back in October that the studio was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nihon-falcom-considering-ai-translation" rel="nofollow">considering utilizing generative AI</a> for speedier translations.</p>

<p>It's not clear how the day-to-day running of Nihon Falcom will be affected by Kato's death, but for now, we can simply mourn the loss of one of the JRPG world's most influential figures. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-awakening-update-apology<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>developer Phoenix Labs has apologized for the game's recent Awakening update, pledging "immediate adjustments" for some of the patch's more controversial features.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://playdauntless.com/news/reflections-what-comes-next/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>website titled "Reflections on the Launch and What Comes Next", Phoenix Labs says it "hear[s]" players' frustration with Awakening and that it "sincerely apologize[s]" to players who felt their "time, effort, and trust were overlooked".</p>

<p>Phoenix Labs goes on to say that while its goals for Awakening were "ambitious", it acknowledges that the release of the update caused "frustration and confusion" and that it's "committed" to earning players' trust back.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dauntless-awakening-update-apology-snow.jpg?itok=icU89lxi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dauntless-awakening-update-apology-snow.jpg?itok=ka4wuZwz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dauntless</em>' Awakening update caused "frustration and confusion", developer Phoenix Labs has admitted.</figcaption></figure><p>In order to "respect [players'] lost progress and investment", Phoenix Labs says it'll be awarding 300,000 Rams and 5,000 Combat Merits to returning players, as well as up to 500 Peerless Aetherite "based on your weapon crafting in the pre-Awakening game".</p>

<p>Additionally, all game modes will be unlocked from the jump for returning players in an upcoming update, so you won't have to complete the new questline to unlock your favorite mode.</p>

<p>Phoenix Labs also says it's currently working on "immediate adjustments...to address progression, monetization, and technical issues", which were three of the biggest areas players identified as frustrations with Awakening.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of the post, Phoenix Labs goes into detail regarding how it plans to reimburse players' time, detailing what initiatives are in place to fix&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>and make it appealing to returning players again.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>' Awakening update, it launched earlier this month, with the Steam version of the game also arriving on the same date.</p>

<p>Handily, that means&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/331370/Dauntless/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam reviews</a>, which are currently sitting at Overwhelmingly Negative,&nbsp;pretty accurately reflect players' feelings about Awakening. Complaints include new paywalls where none previously existed, as well as massive changes to weapon crafting, technical problems, and much more.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that although&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>managed to rack up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-boasts-over-four-million-players-in-first-week" rel="nofollow">more than four million players</a> in its opening week, numbers have dwindled massively since then, and the Awakening update hasn't exactly restored trust in Phoenix Labs.</p>

<p>Hopefully, the changes outlined in the developer's blog post can bring players back, but I wouldn't be surprised if this was the beginning of the end for&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>either. You can play the game right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/331370/Dauntless/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dauntless/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dauntless/9nq0v4dwrk49" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dauntless-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> for free.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance Is Being Delisted in February]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-delisted-february</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-is-being-delisted-in-february.1063248/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-delisted-february<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Wizards of the Coast and developer Tuque Games have announced that fantasy action-RPG&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>is being delisted at the end of February.</p>

<p>Rather curiously, the official announcement of said delisting comes as part of an update to the game's Steam page rather than a post on social media or a blog, as is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/littlebigplanet-3-plus-dlc-delisted-halloween" rel="nofollow">often the case</a> when games are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting-player-surge" rel="nofollow">delisted or shut down</a>.</p>

<p>A new paragraph under&nbsp;<em>Dark Alliance</em>'s "About This Game" section on Steam states that the game will be shut down on February 24th, and that it will no longer be available for purchase starting from that date. Presumably, this applies to the DLC as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-shutting-down-arrow.jpg?itok=t9f3CKSd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-shutting-down-arrow.jpg?itok=TYklfScE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>is going offline in February.</figcaption></figure><p>If you happen to already own&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>and you still want to play it (for some reason) after February 24th, you'll be able to do so, as the offline single-player mode will remain available. That goes for DLC as well.</p>

<p>It's a bit of a mystery that Wizards of the Coast and Tuque Games have decided to completely remove&nbsp;<em>Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>from sale rather than allowing players to purchase an offline version of the game.</p>

<p>However, given the game's <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/11567/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">weak critical reception</a>, that mystery might not be so puzzling after all. Our own Tyler was scarcely more positive than many others in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dungeons-and-dragons-dark-alliance-review" rel="nofollow">his review</a>, citing awkward controls and poor AI as reasons for awarding his 6.5 score.</p>




<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>is (or was, I suppose), it's a co-op hack-and-slash action-RPG in which you and your friends play as one of four iconic&nbsp;<em>D&amp;D&nbsp;</em>heroes: Drizzt Do'Urden, Catti-brie, Wulfgar, and Bruenor Battlehammer.</p>

<p>Playing as one of these heroes (or all of them if you have a full party), you'll take on iconic&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>monsters, explore the legendary land of Icewind Dale, and earn rewards from defeating tough bosses, allowing you to take on ever more challenging quests.</p>

<p>The game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/623280/Dungeons__Dragons_Dark_Alliance/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2037-PPSA02680_00-7187320704565923" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dark-alliance/9MZ55WCBW7TK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, so if you want to keep playing it after February, I'd recommend picking it up now if you haven't already.</p>
