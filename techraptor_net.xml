            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Analogue 3D has been delayed once again, this time to the fourth quarter of 2025, although Analogue says it's almost over the finish line with the beleaguered console.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.analogue.co/announcements/analogue3d-shipping-in-q4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on its official website, Analogue says the new Q4 2025 release window has been "intentionally set conservatively", presumably so that no further delays happen and consumers aren't disappointed again.</p>

<p>The company says that the Analogue 3D is currently "at 99%", and that the project's "hardware, system, [and] packaging" have all been "set for months". It's "the last 1%" on which Analogue is currently "focused", although the company stops short of explaining exactly what that 1% constitutes.</p>

It seems the company is still confident you're going to get your Analogue 3D, although we don't know exactly when yet.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time the Analogue 3D has been delayed. The console, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-announced-and-its-4k-nintendo-64" rel="nofollow">first revealed back in 2023</a>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">pushed back to 2025 in late 2024</a>. The release date was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-july" rel="nofollow">moved once again back in March</a>, with Analogue pledging to ship the machine by July, although that's obviously a goal the company was unable to meet.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what the Analogue 64 is, it's a retro "reimagining" of the Nintendo 64; it plays real N64 cartridges and apes the original aesthetic of Nintendo's console, although mercifully, the controller with which Analogue recommends you play is a little more ergonomic.</p>

<p>Rather than using emulation, the Analogue 3D uses FPGA, which the company says effectively eliminates "incompatibilities found in software emulation like input lag, graphic/audio inaccuracies, timing/frame rate issues and more".</p>

Hopefully.</figcaption></figure><p>The Analogue 3D is now set to launch sometime in Q4 2025 (although, depending on how Analogue calculates quarters, this may mean early 2026).
