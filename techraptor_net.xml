            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hell-let-loose-epic-games-store-free<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has revealed the final free game being given away to PC gamers on the Epic Games Store during the 2024-25 holiday season, and it's the multiplayer-focused World War 2 first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Hell Let Loose</em>.</p>

<p>Over the holiday period, Epic has given away a number of games on its Store, including&nbsp;<em>Control</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ghostrunner 2</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sifu-epic-games-store-free" rel="nofollow">martial arts action brawler&nbsp;<em>Sifu</em></a>, among others. Each of the games available over the last couple of weeks has been redeemable for a single day.</p>

<p><em>Hell Let Loose&nbsp;</em>marks the end of that period, however, as it's available until December 9th, which means Epic has gone back to its usual schedule of giving away one free game per week.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Hell Let Loose</em>, it's a hardcore World War 2-set first-person shooter that was originally developed by Australian outfit Black Matter. It was first released on Steam Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hell-let-loose-hits-steam-early-access-on-july-6" rel="nofollow">back in 2019</a> following a successful Kickstarter campaign two years prior.</p>

<p>In 2022, publisher Team17 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-expands-with-hell-let-loose-and-label-acquisitions" rel="nofollow">took over development</a>, with subsidiary Cover 6 Studios currently handling the bulk of ongoing work on the game in conjunction with British developer Expression Games.</p>

<p>Tragedy then struck&nbsp;<em>Hell Let Loose&nbsp;</em>in July that same year, when producer James Light <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hell-let-loose-producer-james-light-dies-aged-just-28" rel="nofollow">passed away</a> from "complications following cardiac surgery" aged just 28.</p>




<p>As for the game itself, it's a multiplayer-focused shooter that supports up to 100 players in each battle. Players can engage in on-foot battles or take to a number of different vehicles in order to wage war on their opponents.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Hell Let Loose&nbsp;</em>right now for free <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/hell-let-loose-03f036" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on the Epic Games Store</a>. It's also available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686810/Hell_Let_Loose/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/hell-let-loose/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/hell-let-loose/9n44wk3wv2hj" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gothic-1-remake-will-launch-in-2025-developer-says.1072677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Alkimia Interactive has revealed a new&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>release window, although it's perhaps not quite as specific as you might like if you've been waiting for the game since its announcement.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1297900/announcements/detail/519700531080333166" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>, Alkimia wishes the game's fans and followers a happy new year, promising that 2025 will be "a truly key year" for&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>and that it is "working tirelessly" to release the game.</p>

<p>A user named Mr Patrick <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1297900/eventcomments/600766396226347151?snr=1_5_9_#c600766396226353492" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">commented on that post</a>,&nbsp;saying that Alkimia "won't even inform [us] about [the] release date" after telling players they would "get the game in 2024". Alkimia refutes this claim in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1297900/eventcomments/600766396226347151?snr=1_5_9_#c600766396226353606" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a reply</a>, then says that&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>"will be released in 2025".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window-combat.jpg?itok=jrcgEJmI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window-combat.jpg?itok=XcHcjE1B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>finally has a (very broad) release window.</figcaption></figure><p>While a promise that the game will launch in 2025 doesn't sound like much, this is technically the first time Alkimia and publisher THQ Nordic have committed to any kind of release window for&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em>.</p>

<p>Indeed, a collector's edition for the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-collectors-edition" rel="nofollow">was revealed in April</a>, allowing players to spend huge amounts of money on a game that still didn't have a release date or window nailed down.</p>

<p>It's nice to know that the two studios haven't given up on&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em>. Presumably, we'll be getting a more concrete release date sometime in the next few months, but we'll have to wait and see on that front.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake</em>, it is, as you may have guessed, a remake of the first&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>, although "reimagining" might be a little closer to the truth.</p>

<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>'s setting and basic plot setup remain intact, but the remake will add a number of more modern quality-of-life features, as well as a visual overhaul and other changes. Alkimia describes the project as "faithful".</p>

<p>We still don't know when&nbsp;<em>Gothic 1 Remake&nbsp;</em>will launch, but when it does, it'll arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1297900/Gothic_1_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10005976" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/gothic-1-remake/9nbrlcpw4zgv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.&nbsp;</p>
