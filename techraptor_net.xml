            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-picross-donkey-kong<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added two more Game Boy classics to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and if you're a fan of classic puzzlers or old-school retro delights, then these games are very much for you.</p>

<p>As with all of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-donkey-kong-land" rel="nofollow">other</a> Game Boy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-launch" rel="nofollow">games</a> available on the Switch Online <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-zelda-july" rel="nofollow">service</a> (although not Game Boy Advance games, importantly), these two new games can be enjoyed if you've got a basic Switch Online membership. You won't need the Expansion Pack addon to play them.</p>

<p>First to be added today is&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong</em>, also known as&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong '94&nbsp;</em>after the year in which it was released. It's essentially an adaptation of the original&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong</em>, albeit with many, many more levels and some additional gameplay quirks to contend with.</p>

<p>Your second Game Boy offering in today's haul is&nbsp;<em>Mario's Picross</em>. If you're familiar with nonogram-style puzzles, then this one probably doesn't need much introduction.</p>

<p>If you're not, though, nonograms are essentially puzzles where you must systematically eliminate squares on a grid in order to uncover a picture. You'll need to observe the numbers along the sides of the grid carefully to determine which squares need to be filled in and which should be left alone.</p>

<p>As you might expect,&nbsp;<em>Mario's Picross&nbsp;</em>has plenty of&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>-themed images for you to uncover, so if you're looking for a fun way to while away an hour or two, you could do a lot worse.</p>




<p>Both&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong '94&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Mario's Picross&nbsp;</em>are available to play right now on Nintendo Switch Online. You can sign up for a membership via your Switch console's eShop if you're not already subscribed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business Announced for Summer]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-announced</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nacon has announced&nbsp;<em>RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business</em>, a "standalone adventure" intended to serve as a followup (but not necessarily a full-blown sequel) to 2023's&nbsp;<em>RoboCop: Rogue City</em>.</p>

<p>Announced during yesterday's Nacon Connect showcase, <i>Unfinished Business&nbsp;</i>will once again put you in the (presumably extremely heavy) shoes of RoboCop as he prepares to take down a "group of highly trained mercenaries" in the massive housing complex known as OmniTower.</p>

<p>Essentially,&nbsp;<em>Unfinished Business&nbsp;</em>sounds rather like&nbsp;<em>RoboCop: Rogue City&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>The Raid&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Die Hard</em>&nbsp;(or, indeed, 2012's&nbsp;<em>Dredd</em>). Nacon is promising new enemy types, deadly traps, and elite troops to take down.</p>

<p>What's more, you'll also get the chance to play as Alex Murphy, RoboCop's pre-transformation alter ego, and "discover a different side" of the iconic hero.</p>

<p><em>RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527760/RoboCop_Rogue_City__Unfinished_Business/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014077" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business/9NNNFB5F54C9" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in summer.&nbsp;You can check out the announcement trailer for the game<em>&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<h2>What else was revealed during Nacon Connect 2025?</h2>

<p>Plenty of other Nacon games were revealed during the publisher's Connect showcase yesterday.</p>

<p>As well as <i>Unfinished Business</i>, Nacon also revealed a new game in the stealthy&nbsp;<em>Styx&nbsp;</em>series.&nbsp;<em>Styx: Blades of&nbsp;</em><em>Greed&nbsp;</em>is described as a "blend of stealth, action, and strategy", and it's coming to PC and current-gen machines in fall.</p>

That's set for next year on PC and current-gen consoles.</p>

<p>That's not the only eldritch horror game revealed during the show, either.&nbsp;<em>Zeno Clash&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Clash: Artifacts of Chaos&nbsp;</em>developer ACE Team revealed&nbsp;<em>The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu</em>, a first-person co-op horror game loosely based on Lovecraft's novel of the same name. That one's coming next year.</p>
