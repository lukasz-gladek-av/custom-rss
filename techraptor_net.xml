            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-sales-top-5-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>has reached another major new sales milestone, according to developer Stunlock, and there's a big new update in the works for the game as well.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>has officially crossed the 5 million sales milestone, which the developer says "cements the game's status as one of the most popular survival games of recent years". It's hard to disagree with that, especially in conjunction with that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Very Positive Steam rating</a>.</p>

<p>These sales numbers mean that&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>has picked up another 2 million sales or so for itself since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-sales-cross-3-million-threshold" rel="nofollow">hitting the 3 million mark back in January 2023</a>. Given that the game's 1.0 release <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-10-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">landed in May last year</a>&nbsp;and that it hit PS5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-ps5-release-date" rel="nofollow">the following month</a>, that's perhaps to be expected.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/v-rising-sales-5m-castle.jpg?itok=jsVheeQi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/v-rising-sales-5m-castle.jpg?itok=lqebCDjG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>has crossed another big sales threshold (presumably after being asked to do so).</figcaption></figure><p>If you've yet to check out&nbsp;<em>V Rising</em>, then perhaps the "big update" that's on its way to the game this year will convince you it's worth your time.</p>

<p>Stunlock says the update will bring a brand new biome that's "teeming with uncharted territories, a deadly new faction, and ancient technologies ready to be claimed".</p>

<p>In addition, you can look orward to revamped progression, a new Fusion Forge to help you craft "ultimate builds", and "risk-free PvP options" like the ability to duel other players, "customizable castle arenas", and more. All of this is on the way for free, too.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>V Rising</em>, it's a sandbox survival game in which you play as a vampire lord attempting to build your very own vampiric empire in a hostile world.</p>

<p>You can construct your own castle, venture out into the world to find resources and battle enemies, and even team up with (or do battle with) other players.</p>

<p><em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/v-rising/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. There's no word yet on whether it's coming to other platforms.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Developer Direct to Show Off Doom: The Dark Ages and More on January 23rd]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-developer-direct-to-show-off-doom-the-dark-ages-and-more-on-january-23rd.1078020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new Xbox Developer Direct presentation has been announced for later this month, and it will feature updates on upcoming Xbox games, including&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>and more.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/09/xbox-developer-direct-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Xbox Wire news site, the presentation will air on January 23rd. Just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redfall-release-date-revealed-during-xbox-developer-direct" rel="nofollow">previous</a> Developer Direct <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-2024-recap-check-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals" rel="nofollow">showcases</a>, it'll offer "an in-depth look at upcoming titles, how they're being created, and who's creating them".</p>

<p>The show will begin with a new look at Compulsion Games' action-adventure title&nbsp;<em>South of Midnight</em>, and it'll continue with a trip to France to check in with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>developer Sandfall Interactive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-south-of-midnight.jpg?itok=N3pntcyK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-south-of-midnight.jpg?itok=c097vuwL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>South of Midnight&nbsp;</em>is just one of the games that will be featured at this month's Xbox Developer Direct.</figcaption></figure><p>Following those two games, the presentation will switch focus to&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, which is being developed by id Software over in Texas.</p>

<p>Perhaps most tantalizingly, though, Xbox says the showcase will end with a visit to a "surprise location" in order to see "another studio's brand new game". I wonder who that could be?</p>

<p>As ever with Developer Direct showcases, you probably shouldn't expect any extra reveals beyond what's been promised by Microsoft; outside of the "brand new game" that's being teased, it's likely the show will focus on the aforementioned three games.</p>

<p>As for what will be revealed regarding the three games outlined above, I'd be surprised if we didn't get a release date for&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>at the very least, since the game is currently penciled in for a 2025 launch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-developer-direct.jpg?itok=lg1cyQ6O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-developer-direct.jpg?itok=9rBDTFXN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will we get a&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>release date during this month's Xbox Developer Direct?</figcaption></figure><p>Xbox is promising a "full game reveal" for&nbsp;<em>The Dark Ages</em>, as well as a "deep dive" into&nbsp;<em>South of Midnight&nbsp;</em>and a behind-the-scenes look at&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur</em>. Developer Direct shows are traditionally more focused on dev processes than sizzle reels, so expect some interesting insider tidbits.</p>

<p>At any rate, the next Xbox Developer Direct will air on January 23rd at 1pm Eastern (that's 10am Pacific). Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Evo 2025 Lineup Leaked Ahead of Reveal Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/evo-2025-lineup-leaked</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/evo-2025-lineup-leaked-ahead-of-reveal-next-week.1077972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/evo-2025-lineup-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The lineup for this year's Evo tournament appears to have been leaked just a week or so before the official announcement is due to take place.</p>

<p>Per a Nintendo Life <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/oops-evo-2025s-lineup-has-accidentally-been-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the official thumbnail for the upcoming livestream apparently gave away the games before seemingly being changed. It no longer features any of the participating games, instead simply depicting a plain "Evo Announcement Show" banner.</p>

<p>Obviously, this story will contain spoilers for the Evo 2025 lineup, so if you'd rather wait for the official broadcast, which is due to take place on January 14th at 8pm Eastern (that's 5pm Pacific), then make sure you don't read on. Here's an image of Evo 2024 so you can get out before it's too late!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/evo-2025-lineup-leaked-evo-2024.jpg?itok=_8bDRs1d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/evo-2025-lineup-leaked-evo-2024.jpg?itok=c8hKlVz8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is your last chance not to be spoiled on the Evo 2025 lineup.</figcaption></figure><p>Still here? Alright then. Here are the games that were apparently featured in the Evo 2025 livestream's thumbnail before they were hastily removed.</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/street-fighter-6" rel="nofollow"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a></li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tekken-8" rel="nofollow"><em>Tekken 8</em></a></li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/guilty-gear-strive" rel="nofollow"><em>Guilty Gear Strive</em></a></li>
	<li><em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em></li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/under-night-in-birth-ii-sysceles" rel="nofollow"><em>Under Night In-Birth II Sys:Celes</em></a></li>
	<li><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em></li>
	<li><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em></li>
	<li><em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</em></li>
</ul><p>After all that, it's a pretty straightforward lineup, featuring as it does several Evo mainstays; last year's competition also featured&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>, and a number of the other games on this list.</p>

<p>Two games have notably been subbed in, however:&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2&nbsp;</em>have been swapped in for&nbsp;<em>King of Fighters XV&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike</em>.</p>

<p>While you should take this lineup with a small pinch of salt until the official announcement arrives, these games were featured in the Evo 2025 stream lineup before it was changed, so they're almost certainly the games in which you'll be watching competitors duke it out.</p>
