            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-157<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital will release a new update for&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>later today, and as ever, it's adding some new cars, one of which is a certified British classic.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-156" rel="nofollow">last month's Update 1.56</a>, the aptly-named Update 1.57's first major addition to&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is the Aston Martin Vantage '18, which Sony says has been referred to as "the best Aston Martin ever". It's the 2018 version of a car that became its own model line back in 2005.</p>

<p>Your second new car in this update is the&nbsp;Mazda CX-30 X Smart Edition ‘21, a crossover SUV designed to marry the best parts of sports utility vehicles with the convenience and compact nature of regular civvie cars.</p>

It's a "popular leisure activity vehicle that started life as a commercial van", according to Sony. It's not a powerful machine, but it should get you from A to B, at least.</p>

<p>This being a&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update, you can also look forward to new events in the World Circuits mode, as well as new Sophy AI enhancements and more. You can read everything that's new in this update <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/26/gran-turismo-7-update-1-57-available-today/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, it's the latest entry in Sony's long-running&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>series of racing games. Like its predecessors, the game is a "simcade" racer, which means it balances realistic simulation with arcade-style accessibility and ease of use.</p>




<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is also the only&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>game it's currently possible to play without resorting to the second-hand market; last year, Sony delisted the PS4's&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo Sport&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-sport-delisted" rel="nofollow">without warning</a>, although it's still possible to play the offline portions of the game.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>. Update 1.57 lands at 10pm Pacific tonight (that's 1am the following morning in Eastern time).</p>
