            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' open beta period has begun, and despite the fact that this isn't even a full game release, it's already broken Steam player records for the franchise as a whole.</p>

<p>A quick look at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3065170/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB's stats</a> for the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta">open beta</a> shows that the test hit a staggering total of 463,798 players at its peak, and that it's currently sitting pretty at 441,009 players (at time of writing).</p>

<p>By way of comparison,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World</em>, which remains the <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">biggest-selling</a>&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game to date, managed 334,684 players at its busiest on Steam, while&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>hit 231,360. Both are very respectable totals, but they don't hold a candle to&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>' beta test.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>'s demo, for instance, attracted just 23,991 players at its peak, while the demo for expansion&nbsp;<em>Sunbreak&nbsp;</em>topped out at 27,540. Again, those aren't numbers to be sniffed at, but they do show just how popular&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' open beta is.</p>

<p>The open beta is free, of course, and so many players may be checking it out even if they don't intend to buy the full game. Still, it looks like Capcom will have another bona fide success on its hands when&nbsp;<em>Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date">launches in February</a>.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, it's the latest game in Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series of action RPGs.</p>

<p>Set in the Forbidden Lands, the game will once again see players venturing out into large semi-open world areas to do battle with a series of monsters, including the game's new flagship beast Arkveld, also known as the White Wraith.</p>

<p>The open beta offers a look at the character creator, as well as an open hunt and a portion of the story. Of course, the internet has already <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/monster-hunter-wilds-character-creator-is-being-used-to-make-scarily-accurate-recreations-of-superheroes-actors-and-characters-from-other-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">created some pretty impressive stuff</a> with said character creator.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 28th.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lucas-pope-surprise-releases-lcd-throwback-game-moida-mansion.1025061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lucas-pope-moida-mansion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legendary indie<em>&nbsp;</em>developer Lucas Pope has released&nbsp;<em>Moida Mansion</em>, a brand new game inspired by Tiger Electronics handhelds and <em>Game &amp; Watch&nbsp;</em>that you can play right now on PC.</p>

<p>Pope is perhaps best known for the likes of maritime detective game&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/return-of-obra-dinn">Return of the Obra Dinn</a>&nbsp;</em>and oppressive document-checking simulator&nbsp;<em>Papers, Please</em>, but&nbsp;<em>Moida Mansion</em> has an altogether different tone, as you've probably guessed from the humorously phonetic spelling of "murder" in the title.</p>

<p>On <em>Moida Mansion</em>'s <a href="https://dukope.itch.io/moida-mansion" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Itch.io page</a>, it's presented as a charmingly old-school handheld throwback, with the screen surrounded by character artwork and some properly chunky-looking retro buttons (which you'll need to click to interact with the game).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lucas-pope-moida-mansion-view.jpg?itok=seiY7fJd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lucas-pope-moida-mansion-view.jpg?itok=u65_26lM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Moida Mansion&nbsp;</em>is a deliberate homage to the Tiger Electronics devices of yesteryear.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Moida Mansion</em>'s display pays homage to the devices Pope was seemingly inspired by; it's got a monochrome color scheme and the refresh rate is low, leading to an effect that's almost a slideshow-style series of still images rather than a fluid, moving image.</p>

<p>The game is also accompanied by a delightful 80s-style instruction manual; in fact, Pope himself <a href="https://x.com/dukope/status/1852057229438128510" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> that&nbsp;<em>Moida Mansion&nbsp;</em>was "a good excuse to make a very 80s instruction manual", apologizing to any players "struggling through [his] youth here".</p>

<p>You play as a member of the Adventure Club, an intrepid group of kids who have wandered into the titular mansion in order to find a wayward turtle mascot. Unfortunately, you're not alone in the mansion, and so you must look for your missing friends while also avoiding a "terrible monsta".</p>

<p>You'll need to search through objects to find your friends, and rooms in the mansion often contain secrets or hidden passages as well. Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Moida Mansion&nbsp;</em>"is constantly changing", as Pope says, so each run won't be the same.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lucas-pope-return-of-the-obra-dinn.jpg?itok=WzZY2KZG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lucas-pope-return-of-the-obra-dinn.jpg?itok=hBZ0Ixlr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lucas Pope is best known for games like&nbsp;<em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Moida Mansion&nbsp;</em>operates along similar lines to&nbsp;<a href="https://play.date/games/mars-after-midnight/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Mars After Midnight</em></a>, a work simulator Pope designed for the retro Playdate console line, as well as the similarly LCD-heavy&nbsp;<em>LCD, Please</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Game &amp; Watch</em>-style take on&nbsp;<em>Papers, Please</em>.</p>

<p>You can play&nbsp;<em>Moida Mansion&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via Itch.io, and you can also find some of Lucas Pope's <a href="https://dukope.itch.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">other work there</a> if you're interested in checking that out.</p>
