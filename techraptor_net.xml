            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-vatican-city<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Given how popular&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>is, it's no stretch to imagine that the game has been played all around the world, but Larian has revealed that two people in a very unusual place indeed have enjoyed the game.</p>

<p>According to publishing director <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1855995474492207263" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Michael Douse on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, two copies of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>have been sold in Vatican City, and one person there has it on their Steam wishlist as well.</p>

<p>Douse rather amusingly says he likes to imagine the wishlisting person is "the Pope waiting until he has a free minute", expressing a wish to "see their mod list" and suggesting said list is "absolutely gnarly". That seems like an understatement.</p>

At <a href="https://www.vaticanstate.va/it/stato-governo/note-generali/popolazione.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">last count</a>, 764 people inhabited Vatican City, with 618 of those people being citizens.</p>

<p>It should go without saying that Vatican City is an intensely religious place, so it's quite amusing to imagine someone living in such a place playing&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, a game that might have been considered heretical by the Catholic Church just a few decades ago.</p>

<p>Perhaps even more amusingly, <a href="https://x.com/samito/status/1856006701259816994" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">one person</a> in the replies to Douse's original post suggests that the two Vatican City sales of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>were a "clerical error". Badum, and indeed, tish.</p>

<p>In any case, I hope the two Vatican City players of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>are enjoying it, whoever they happen to be, and I hope whoever has it on their wishlist decides to take the plunge and buy it. You won't regret it!</p>

Larian has already confirmed that this update <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-preview-larian" rel="nofollow">won't be the game's last</a>.</p>
