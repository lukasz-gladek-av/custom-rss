            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-war-of-mine-charity-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine&nbsp;</em>DLC pack to celebrate the game's tenth anniversary, and all proceeds from the sale of said DLC will go to charity.</p>

<p>The aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Forget Celebrations&nbsp;</em>DLC spotlights Katia, a character from the original&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine&nbsp;</em>and a seasoned war journalist. When a missile attack destroys her home, she's forced into a fight not only for her survival, but also for the survival of the book she's writing.</p>

<p>All proceeds from&nbsp;<em>Forget Celebrations&nbsp;</em>will go straight to 11 bit's four charity partners, namely <a href="https://www.warchild.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">War Child</a>, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amnesty International</a>, <a href="https://www.libertyukraine.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Liberty Ukraine Foundation</a>, and Indie Games Poland, so the studio isn't taking a cent of your money for this one.</p>

<p>Naturally, since this is another slice of&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine</em>, you can expect some very difficult decisions to crop up, as well as lots of opportunities to scavenge for resources and materials Katia will need to finish her book.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time 11 bit has donated all of the proceeds from all or part of&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine&nbsp;</em>to charity. When Russia first invaded Ukraine, the studio pledged all of the game's profits <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-war-of-mine-profits-to-be-donated-to-ukrainian-red-cross-over-next-7-days" rel="nofollow">to the Ukrainian Red Cross for a week</a>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the game has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-war-of-mine-is-being-taught-at-polish-schools" rel="nofollow">recommended by the Polish government</a> for teaching in schools, so it's not just gaming fans that are benefiting from&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine</em>'s penetrating look at wartorn societies.</p>

<p>By the end of that month,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>sales had hit 441,000, which means it managed to sell almost <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">an extra 100,000 copies</a> in the week or so between then and its initial release. It looks like <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/technology/articles/2024-09-23/shares-of-video-game-maker-11-bit-studios-slump-after-frostpunk-2-release" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fears that the game underperformed</a> may well have been unfounded.</p>
