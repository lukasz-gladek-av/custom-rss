            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-nintendo-direct<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Nintendo held a new Nintendo Direct presentation in which the Japanese gaming giant showed off more gameplay details for the upcoming racer&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p>

<p>Set to debut <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">alongside the Switch 2 on June 5th</a>,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>represents the first entirely new mainline&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game since 2014's&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8</em>, and Nintendo has packed in a fair few new features to reflect that. Here's everything covered during today's show!</p>

<hr><h2>New and returning courses in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></h2>

<p>First, we got a look at some of the courses that will be featured in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>. As you'd expect, there will be a number of new courses on offer, as well as several returning favorites.</p>

<p>New courses include the canyon-set Mario Bros. Circuit, the urban Crown City, and the spooky movie theater Boo Cinema, while returning courses include the likes of Toad's Factory, Peach Beach, and Wario Shipyard.</p>

<h2>New and returning racers in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></h2>

<p>Several new characters will be introduced as part of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>'s lineup. They include the likes of the series' iconic Goomba, as well as a cloudless Lakitu, New Donk City mayor Pauline, and more.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also look forward to certain characters making a return; Mario and Luigi are givens, and Peach, Bowser, and many others will be coming back to race in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to choose which vehicle you want to use while racing, and each vehicle has different stats, as do the characters themselves. It doesn't look like you'll be choosing individual parts for your vehicles this time around, though.</p>

<h2><em>Mario Kart World</em>'s many gameplay modes</h2>

<p>We also got a look at the gameplay modes that will be featured in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>. As has been previously revealed, the two main modes on offer are Grand Prix and Knockout Tour.</p>

<p>The former works like a classic&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>Grand Prix mode; you'll race across four courses, and the winner is the racer who accrues the most points, although you will also be driving between courses now.</p>

<p>Knockout Tour, meanwhile, tasks you with placing ahead of other racers to avoid being eliminated. Several different sets of courses will be available for both modes. Of course, classic multiplayer staples like VS Race and Battle Mode will also be available.</p>

<p><em>Mario Kart World</em>'s Free Roam mode is exactly what it sounds like; you'll be exploring the game's world, finding hidden switches and panels to take on missions. Nintendo didn't reveal whether the missions will unlock any extra stuff, but they should be a fun way to hone your racing skills.</p>

<h2>New items and gameplay tricks</h2>

<p><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will introduce a number of new items you can use to get one over on your racing rivals. They include the Mega Mushroom, which lets you grow to a massive size and stomp your enemies, and the Hammer, which you can throw to create obstacles on the course.</p>

<p>These will, of course, accompany returning items like Bullet Bill and the Lightning powerup, although I don't think I spotted the iconic Blue Shell during the Direct. Hopefully, it'll be making some kind of return; a&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game with no Blue Shell is no&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game at all.</p>

You can then use that jump to dodge projectiles and other hazards.</p>

<p>We also got a look at&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>'s drive-thru Yoshi's, which will let you collect food items in order to unlock new outfits. You can then select these outfits on the character selection screen.</p>

<p>Several support features will be available, too, including smart steering and auto-acceleration, which you can use to level the playing field if you're experiencing&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>alongside franchise newbies.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most intriguing of these is the Rewind feature, which lets you rewind yourself to a point before making a mistake. It only works on the racer using it, though, so be aware of that if you're using it tactically.</p>

<hr><p>That's everything we got to see during today's&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>Direct show! The game is due to launch <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/mario-kart-world/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2</a> on June 5th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-royal-writ-permadeath-deckbuilder</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-royal-writ-is-a-permadeath-deckbuilder-from-yogscast-games.1166691/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-royal-writ-permadeath-deckbuilder<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yogscast Games and developer Save Sloth Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ</em>, a lane-based deckbuilder with an extra sting in its tail for those who like their difficulty a little higher.</p>

<p>The game sees you marching your troops across a series of procedurally-generated maps in order to defeat the final boss and emerge from your run victorious. So far, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-train-2-announced-demo-now" rel="nofollow">so deckbuilder</a>, but there's a twist to this one.</p>

<p>If your cards arrive at their destination and the enemy base still has health remaining, then those cards will be permanently deleted from your deck for that run, so you'll have to make clever decisions about which cards to send and which ones to reserve.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-royal-writ-announcement-cards.jpg?itok=03QgPM-N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-royal-writ-announcement-cards.jpg?itok=KaiRZV30 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>has an extra sting in its tail thanks to card permadeath.</figcaption></figure><p>Save Sloth and Yogscast say the permadeath mechanic in&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>is all part of the point; the system is designed to create "the ultimate jeopardy", leading to "emergent sub-stories" and "memorable" individual runs.</p>

<p>The studios say the point is either to "achieve victory through strategic planning or game-breaking synergies", or to "fail miserably because your soldier got stuck in a bog and you forgot he can't fly". We've all been there.</p>

<p>All of this is wrapped up in "cute picture-book visuals" that emphasize the "grotesque and absurd humor of a medieval world engulfed in constant war and deceit".</p>

<p>Development on&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>began as part of game jam competition Ludum Dare 55, and following "hugely positive feedback", the game moved into full development. You can check out&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ</em>'s debut trailer here.</p>




<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but if you'd like to give the game a go, a playable demo will be available "soon", according to Yogscast and Save Sloth.</p>

<p><em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>is set for release in 2025 for PC via Steam. There's no word on console ports for the game yet.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-revenue-2024-lost-records</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dont-nod-revenue-dips-in-2024-lost-records-sales-in-line-with-forecasts.1166664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-revenue-2024-lost-records<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>developer Don't Nod has released its financial statement for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and things are looking a little gloomy for the French studio.</p>

<p>The statement shows that revenues are down significantly; operating revenues fell by 25% to&nbsp;€23.9 million, as compared to 2023's&nbsp;€32.1 million figure. CEO Oskar Guilbert says this year's performance reflects games that "fell short of our expectations" despite "a very positive critical reception".</p>

<p>Despite the revenue drop, Don't Nod says sales were up 14% on last year, largely driven by the studio's back catalog, as well as 2023's&nbsp;<em>Jusant&nbsp;</em>and early 2024's&nbsp;<em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden&nbsp;</em>(although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024" rel="nofollow">both games underperformed by the studio's standards</a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nod-financials-2024.jpg?itok=Xx9xNHlH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nod-financials-2024.jpg?itok=Z8Arhvcd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't Nod's revenues were down in 2024, but sales were up.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Don't Nod, future sales for&nbsp;<em>Jusant&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Banishers&nbsp;</em>are "not expected to generate sufficient revenues to cover the full development costs", which essentially means both games have made a loss.</p>

<p>Additionally, the "temporary suspension" of the as-yet unannounced projects P12 and P13, as well as the full cancellation of projects P10 and P14 (these are all internal codenames, of course), led to further losses for Don't Nod.</p>

<p>With all of this said, you might be wondering how the studio's most recent release,&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, is performing. Don't Nod doesn't provide sales figures for the game, but it does say sales are "in line with forecasts in an increasingly selective market".</p>

<p>The studio also points to the "critical acclaim" for&nbsp;<em>Lost Records</em>, which is reflected by the game's Metacritic average and Steam review score. Our own Tyler was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-review-rocking-in-90s" rel="nofollow">reasonably impressed</a> by&nbsp;<em>Lost Records&nbsp;</em>as well.</p>

That's scheduled for release in late 2025.</p>
